our primary financial commitments as of the date hereof are payments owed commitments due under the license agreement is summarized as follows amount         and thereafter    capital expenditures none critical accounting policies a use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions which are evaluated on an ongoing basis that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments in particular significant estimates and judgments include those related to the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities derivative liabilities the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events accordingly the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates b contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to us but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in our consolidated financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantee would be disclosed c fair value of financial instruments we adopted the guidance of accounting standards codification asc  for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value prescribes methods for measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data level inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash accounts receivable other current assets other assets accounts payable accrued liabilities and notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments the company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance asc  financial instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value fair value option the fair value option may be elected on an instrumentbyinstrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs if the fair value option is elected for an instrument unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date we did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments d accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at realizable value net of allowances for doubtful accounts which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded we have a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors including the period they have been outstanding historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts in addition we regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates revisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense receivables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are writtenoff recoveries of receivables previously writtenoff are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts there were no recoveries during the years ended december   and  e inventory we primarily values inventories at the lower of cost or market applied on a firstin firstout basis we identify and write down our excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value based on usage forecasts order volume and inventory aging with the development of new products we also rationalizes our product offerings and will writedown discontinued product to the lower of cost or net realizable value f intangibles all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired where intangibles are deemed to be impaired we recognize an impairment loss measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the intangible and its book value g license agreements license agreements acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and impairments amortization amortization is reported in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets unless the useful life is indefinite amortizable intangible assets are amortized from the date that they are available for use the estimated useful life of the license agreement is five years which is the expected period for which we expect to derive a benefit from the underlying license agreements h longterm assets assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets i revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition asc  in general our records revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the products or services have been approved by the customer after delivery andor installation acceptance or performance of services the sales price is

do not enter into any leasing of kiosks arrangements with customers and we do not generate any revenues from merchants who access our terminals as yet j sharebased payment arrangements generally all forms of sharebased payments including stock option grants restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date based on the estimated number
