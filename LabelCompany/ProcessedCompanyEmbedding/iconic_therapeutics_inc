eye also called uveal melanoma is the most common primary eye cancer in adults and the second most common type of melanoma like other melanomas om begins in melanocytes the cells that produce the pigment melanin in the united states there are approximately 0 new cases each year om is a particularly dangerous form of melanoma and accounts for approximately – of all melanoma cases approximately 0 of the ocular melanoma cases will metastasize to other organs there is currently no known cure for metastatic om unmet need for treatments there is an unmet need for om treatments current therapy for om depends on the size location and other characteristics of the tumor at the time of diagnosis some ocular melanomas require removal of the eye enucleation others are treated with radiation in either case vision is lost or severely impaired in the affected eye evaluation of om tumors may include genetic testing which helps physicians predict likelihood of metastasis but there are no treatment guarantees against om’s metastatic spread research because om is a rare disease there has only been a modest amount of research into treatments or cures one challenge is finding enough om
