the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give

karl kraus april   – june   was an austrian writer and journalist known as a satirist essayist aphorist playwright and poet he directed his satire at the press german culture and german and austrian politics the austrian author stefan zweig once called kraus the master of venomous ridicule der meister des giftigen spotts he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature three times contents  biography  early life  career  before   –  –  –  character  selected works  works in english translation  references  citations  sources  external links biographyedit early lifeedit kraus was born into the wealthy jewish family of jacob kraus a papermaker and his wife ernestine née kantor in jičín austrianhungarian empire now the czech republic the family moved to vienna in  his mother died in  kraus enrolled as a law student at the university of vienna in  beginning in april of the same year he began contributing to the paper wiener literaturzeitung starting with a critique of gerhart hauptmanns the weavers around that time he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater in  he changed his field of studies to philosophy and german literature he discontinued his studies in  his friendship with peter altenberg began about this time careeredit before edit first issue of die fackel in  kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor stage director and performer joining the young vienna group which included peter altenberg leopold andrian hermann bahr richard beerhofmann arthur schnitzler hugo von hofmannsthal and felix salten in  kraus broke from this group with a biting satire die demolierte literatur demolished literature and was named vienna correspondent for the newspaper breslauer zeitung one year later as an uncompromising advocate of jewish assimilation he attacked the founder of modern zionism theodor herzl with his polemic eine krone für zion a crown for zion the title is a play on words in that krone means both crown and the currency of austriahungary from  to  one krone was the minimum donation required to participate in the zionist congress in basel and herzl was often mocked as the king of zion könig von zion by viennese antizionists on april   kraus renounced judaism and in the same year he founded his own newspaper die fackel de the torch which he continued to direct publish and write until his death and from which he launched his attacks on hypocrisy psychoanalysis corruption of the habsburg empire nationalism of the pangerman movement laissezfaire economic policies and numerous other subjects –edit in  kraus was sued by hermann bahr and emmerich bukovics who felt they had been attacked in die fackel many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years also in  kraus found out that his publisher moriz frisch had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a monthslong journey frisch had registered the magazines front cover as a trademark and published the neue fackel new torch kraus sued and won from that time die fackel was published without a cover page by the printer jahoda  siegel while die fackel at first resembled journals like die weltbühne it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its editorial independence thanks to krauss financial independence die fackel printed what kraus wanted to be printed in its first decade contributors included such wellknown writers and artists as peter altenberg richard dehmel egon friedell oskar kokoschka else laskerschüler adolf loos heinrich mann arnold schönberg august strindberg georg trakl frank wedekind franz werfel houston stewart chamberlain and oscar wilde after  however kraus was usually the sole author krauss work was published nearly exclusively in die fackel of which  irregularly issued numbers appeared in total authors who were supported by kraus include peter altenberg else laskerschüler and georg trakl die fackel targeted corruption journalists and brutish behaviour notable enemies were maximilian harden in the mud of the harden–eulenburg affair moriz benedikt owner of the newspaper neue freie presse alfred kerr hermann bahr imre bekessy de and johann schober in  kraus published sittlichkeit und kriminalität morality and criminal justice for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice der skandal fängt an wenn die polizei ihm ein ende macht the scandal starts when the police ends it starting in  kraus published the first of his aphorisms in die fackel they were collected in  in the book sprüche und widersprüche sayings and gainsayings in addition to his writings kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career put on approximately  oneman performances between  and  in which he read from the dramas of bertolt brecht gerhart hauptmann johann nestroy goethe and shakespeare and also performed offenbachs operettas accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself elias canetti who regularly attended krauss lectures titled the second volume of his autobiography die fackel im ohr the torch in the ear in reference to the magazine and its author at the peak of his popularity krauss lectures attracted four thousand people and his magazine sold forty thousand copies in  kraus supported frank wedekind to make possible the staging in vienna of his controversial play pandoras box the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in german society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution these plays frank depiction of sexuality and violence including lesbianism and an encounter with jack the ripper pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time wedekinds works are considered among the precursors of expressionism but in  when expressionist poets like richard dehmel began producing war propaganda kraus became a fierce critic of them in  kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor maximilian harden because of his role in the eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular erledigungen dispatchescitation needed –edit after  kraus was the sole author of most issues of die fackel one of krauss most influential satiricalliterary techniques was his détournement of quotations one controversy arose with the text die orgie which exposed how the newspaper neue freie presse was blatantly supporting austrias liberal partys election campaign the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper die fackel would publish it later in  the enraged editor who fell for the trick responded by suing kraus for disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors after an obituary for franz ferdinand who had been assassinated in sarajevo on  june  die fackel was not published for many months in december  it appeared again with an essay in dieser großen zeit in this grand time in dieser großen zeit die ich noch gekannt habe wie sie so klein war die wieder klein werden wird wenn ihr dazu noch zeit bleibt … in dieser lauten zeit die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen symphonie der taten die berichte hervorbringen und der berichte welche taten verschulden in dieser da mögen sie von mir kein eigenes wort erwarten in this grand time which i used to know when it was this small which will become small again if there is time … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports and of reports that cause deeds in this one you may not expect a word of my own in the subsequent time kraus wrote against the world war and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of die fackel krauss masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the first world war die letzten tage der menschheit the last days of mankind which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary by two characters called the grumbler and the optimist kraus began to write the play in  and first published it as a series of special fackel issues in  its epilogue die letzte nacht the last night had already been published in  as a special issue edward timms has called the work a faulted masterpiece and a fissured text because the evolution of krauss attitude during the time of its composition from aristocratic conservative to democratic republican gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a geological fault also in  kraus published his collected war texts under the title weltgericht world court of justice in  he published the satire literatur oder man wird doch da sehn literature or you aint seen nothing yet as a reply to franz werfels spiegelmensch mirror man an attack against krauscitation needed plaque of karl kraus on the house where he was born in jičín –edit during january  kraus started a fight against imre békessy publisher of the tabloid die stunde the hour accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him békessy retaliated with a libel campaign against kraus who in turn launched an erledigung with the catchphrase hinaus aus wien mit dem schuft throw the scoundrel out of vienna in  békessy indeed fled vienna to avoid arrest békessy achieved some later success when his novel barabbas was the monthly selection of an american book clubcitation needed a peak in krauss political commitment was his sensational attack in  on the powerful vienna police chief johann schober also a former twoterm chancellor after  people were shot dead in the police massacre of the july revolt kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested schobers resignation the poster was published all over vienna and is considered an icon of thcentury austrian history in  the play die unüberwindlichen the insurmountables was published it included allusions to the fights against békessy and schober during that same year kraus also published the records of a lawsuit kerr had filed against him after kraus had published kerrs war poems in die fackel kerr having become a pacifist did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed in  kraus translated shakespeares sonnets kraus supported the social democratic party of austria from at least the early s and in  hoping engelbert dollfuss could prevent nazism from engulfing austria he supported dollfusss coup détat which established the austrian fascist regime this support estranged kraus from some of his followers in  kraus wrote die dritte walpurgisnacht the third walpurgis night of which the first fragments appeared in die fackel kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to hitler who still lived in the third reich from nazi reprisals and in part because violence is no subject for polemic this satire on nazi ideology begins with the nowfamous sentence mir fällt zu hitler nichts ein hitler brings nothing to my mind lengthy extracts appear in krauss apologia for his silence at hitlers coming to power warum die fackel nicht erscheint why die fackel is not published a page edition of the periodical the last issue of die fackel appeared in february  kraus died of an embolism of the heart in vienna on june   after a short illness kraus never married but from  until his death he had a conflictprone but close relationship with the baroness sidonie nádherný von borutin – many of his works were written in janowitz castle nádherny family property sidonie nádherny became an important pen pal to kraus and addressee of his books and poems in  kraus was baptized as a catholic but in  disillusioned by the churchs support for the war he left the catholic church claiming sarcastically that he was motivated primarily by antisemitism ie indignation at max reinhardts use of the kollegienkirche in salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance kraus is buried in the zentralfriedhof cemetery outside vienna kraus was the subject of two books by thomas szasz karl kraus and the soul doctors and antifreud karl krauss criticism of psychoanalysis and psychiatry which portray kraus as a harsh critic of sigmund freud and of psychoanalysis in general other commentators such as edward timms have argued that kraus respected freud though with reservations about the application of some of his theories and that his views were far less blackandwhite than szasz suggests characteredit karl kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime marcel reichranicki called him vain selfrighteous and selfimportant krauss followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience and reprinted die fackel in volume form years after it was first published a concern with language was central to krauss outlook and he viewed his contemporaries careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world viennese composer ernst krenek described meeting the writer in  at a time when people were generally decrying the japanese bombardment of shanghai i met karl kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems he said something like i know that everything is futile when the house is burning but i have to do this as long as it is at all possible for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place shanghai would not be burning up to  kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum as he considered the flaws of the right too selfevident to be worthy of his comment later his responses to the nazis included the third walpurgis night to the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship however he was a bitter misanthrope and poor wouldbe alfred kerr he was accused of wallowing in hateful denouncements and erledigungen breakingsoffcitation needed along with karl valentin he is considered a master of gallows humor giorgio agamben compared guy debord and kraus for their criticism of journalists and media culture gregor von rezzori wrote of kraus

june   aged  vienna karl kraus april   – june   was an austrian writer and journalist known as a satirist essayist aphorist playwright and poet he directed his satire at the press german culture and german and austrian politics the austrian author stefan zweig once called kraus the master of venomous ridicule der meister des giftigen spotts he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature three times contents  biography  early life  career  before   –  –  –  character  selected works  works in english translation  references  citations  sources  external links biographyedit early lifeedit kraus was born into the wealthy jewish family of jacob kraus a papermaker and his wife ernestine née kantor in jičín austrianhungarian empire now the czech republic the family moved to vienna in  his mother died in  kraus enrolled as a law student at the university of vienna in  beginning in april of the same year he began contributing to the paper wiener literaturzeitung starting with a critique of gerhart hauptmanns the weavers around that time he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater in  he changed his field of studies to philosophy and german literature he discontinued his studies in  his friendship with peter altenberg began about this time careeredit before edit first issue of die fackel in  kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor stage director and performer joining the young vienna group which included peter altenberg leopold andrian hermann bahr richard beerhofmann arthur schnitzler hugo von hofmannsthal and felix salten in  kraus broke from this group with a biting satire die demolierte literatur demolished literature and was named vienna correspondent for the newspaper breslauer zeitung one year later as an uncompromising advocate of jewish assimilation he attacked the founder of modern zionism theodor herzl with his polemic eine krone für zion a crown for zion the title is a play on words in that krone means both crown and the currency of austriahungary from  to  one krone was the minimum donation required to participate in the zionist congress in basel and herzl was often mocked as the king of zion könig von zion by viennese antizionists on april   kraus renounced judaism and in the same year he founded his own newspaper die fackel de the torch which he continued to direct publish and write until his death and from which he launched his attacks on hypocrisy psychoanalysis corruption of the habsburg empire nationalism of the pangerman movement laissezfaire economic policies and numerous other subjects –edit in  kraus was sued by hermann bahr and emmerich bukovics who felt they had been attacked in die fackel many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years also in  kraus found out that his publisher moriz frisch had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a monthslong journey frisch had registered the magazines front cover as a trademark and published the neue fackel new torch kraus sued and won from that time die fackel was published without a cover page by the printer jahoda  siegel while die fackel at first resembled journals like die weltbühne it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its editorial independence thanks to krauss financial independence die fackel printed what kraus wanted to be printed in its first decade contributors included such wellknown writers and artists as peter altenberg richard dehmel egon friedell oskar kokoschka else laskerschüler adolf loos heinrich mann arnold schönberg august strindberg georg trakl frank wedekind franz werfel houston stewart chamberlain and oscar wilde after  however kraus was usually the sole author krauss work was published nearly exclusively in die fackel of which  irregularly issued numbers appeared in total authors who were supported by kraus include peter altenberg else laskerschüler and georg trakl die fackel targeted corruption journalists and brutish behaviour notable enemies were maximilian harden in the mud of the harden–eulenburg affair moriz benedikt owner of the newspaper neue freie presse alfred kerr hermann bahr imre bekessy de and johann schober in  kraus published sittlichkeit und kriminalität morality and criminal justice for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice der skandal fängt an wenn die polizei ihm ein ende macht the scandal starts when the police ends it starting in  kraus published the first of his aphorisms in die fackel they were collected in  in the book sprüche und widersprüche sayings and gainsayings in addition to his writings kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career put on approximately  oneman performances between  and  in which he read from the dramas of bertolt brecht gerhart hauptmann johann nestroy goethe and shakespeare and also performed offenbachs operettas accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself elias canetti who regularly attended krauss lectures titled the second volume of his autobiography die fackel im ohr the torch in the ear in reference to the magazine and its author at the peak of his popularity krauss lectures attracted four thousand people and his magazine sold forty thousand copies in  kraus supported frank wedekind to make possible the staging in vienna of his controversial play pandoras box the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in german society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution these plays frank depiction of sexuality and violence including lesbianism and an encounter with jack the ripper pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time wedekinds works are considered among the precursors of expressionism but in  when expressionist poets like richard dehmel began producing war propaganda kraus became a fierce critic of them in  kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor maximilian harden because of his role in the eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular erledigungen dispatchescitation needed –edit after  kraus was the sole author of most issues of die fackel one of krauss most influential satiricalliterary techniques was his détournement of quotations one controversy arose with the text die orgie which exposed how the newspaper neue freie presse was blatantly supporting austrias liberal partys election campaign the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper die fackel would publish it later in  the enraged editor who fell for the trick responded by suing kraus for disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors after an obituary for franz ferdinand who had been assassinated in sarajevo on  june  die fackel was not published for many months in december  it appeared again with an essay in dieser großen zeit in this grand time in dieser großen zeit die ich noch gekannt habe wie sie so klein war die wieder klein werden wird wenn ihr dazu noch zeit bleibt … in dieser lauten zeit die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen symphonie der taten die berichte hervorbringen und der berichte welche taten verschulden in dieser da mögen sie von mir kein eigenes wort erwarten in this grand time which i used to know when it was this small which will become small again if there is time … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports and of reports that cause deeds in this one you may not expect a word of my own in the subsequent time kraus wrote against the world war and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of die fackel krauss masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the first world war die letzten tage der menschheit the last days of mankind which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary by two characters called the grumbler and the optimist kraus began to write the play in  and first published it as a series of special fackel issues in  its epilogue die letzte nacht the last night had already been published in  as a special issue edward timms has called the work a faulted masterpiece and a fissured text because the evolution of krauss attitude during the time of its composition from aristocratic conservative to democratic republican gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a geological fault also in  kraus published his collected war texts under the title weltgericht world court of justice in  he published the satire literatur oder man wird doch da sehn literature or you aint seen nothing yet as a reply to franz werfels spiegelmensch mirror man an attack against krauscitation needed plaque of karl kraus on the house where he was born in jičín –edit during january  kraus started a fight against imre békessy publisher of the tabloid die stunde the hour accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him békessy retaliated with a libel campaign against kraus who in turn launched an erledigung with the catchphrase hinaus aus wien mit dem schuft throw the scoundrel out of vienna in  békessy indeed fled vienna to avoid arrest békessy achieved some later success when his novel barabbas was the monthly selection of an american book clubcitation needed a peak in krauss political commitment was his sensational attack in  on the powerful vienna police chief johann schober also a former twoterm chancellor after  people were shot dead in the police massacre of the july revolt kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested schobers resignation the poster was published all over vienna and is considered an icon of thcentury austrian history in  the play die unüberwindlichen the insurmountables was published it included allusions to the fights against békessy and schober during that same year kraus also published the records of a lawsuit kerr had filed against him after kraus had published kerrs war poems in die fackel kerr having become a pacifist did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed in  kraus translated shakespeares sonnets kraus supported the social democratic party of austria from at least the early s and in  hoping engelbert dollfuss could prevent nazism from engulfing austria he supported dollfusss coup détat which established the austrian fascist regime this support estranged kraus from some of his followers in  kraus wrote die dritte walpurgisnacht the third walpurgis night of which the first fragments appeared in die fackel kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to hitler who still lived in the third reich from nazi reprisals and in part because violence is no subject for polemic this satire on nazi ideology begins with the nowfamous sentence mir fällt zu hitler nichts ein hitler brings nothing to my mind lengthy extracts appear in krauss apologia for his silence at hitlers coming to power warum die fackel nicht erscheint why die fackel is not published a page edition of the periodical the last issue of die fackel appeared in february  kraus died of an embolism of the heart in vienna on june   after a short illness kraus never married but from  until his death he had a conflictprone but close relationship with the baroness sidonie nádherný von borutin – many of his works were written in janowitz castle nádherny family property sidonie nádherny became an important pen pal to kraus and addressee of his books and poems in  kraus was baptized as a catholic but in  disillusioned by the churchs support for the war he left the catholic church claiming sarcastically that he was motivated primarily by antisemitism ie indignation at max reinhardts use of the kollegienkirche in salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance kraus is buried in the zentralfriedhof cemetery outside vienna kraus was the subject of two books by thomas szasz karl kraus and the soul doctors and antifreud karl krauss criticism of psychoanalysis and psychiatry which portray kraus as a harsh critic of sigmund freud and of psychoanalysis in general other commentators such as edward timms have argued that kraus respected freud though with reservations about the application of some of his theories and that his views were far less blackandwhite than szasz suggests characteredit karl kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime marcel reichranicki called him vain selfrighteous and selfimportant krauss followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience and reprinted die fackel in volume form years after it was first published a concern with language was central to krauss outlook and he viewed his contemporaries careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world viennese composer ernst krenek described meeting the writer in  at a time when people were generally decrying the japanese bombardment of shanghai i met karl kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems he said something like i know that everything is futile when the house is burning but i have to do this as long as it is at all possible for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place shanghai would not be burning up to  kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum as he considered the flaws of the right too selfevident to be worthy of his comment later his responses to the nazis included the third walpurgis night to the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship however he was a bitter misanthrope and poor wouldbe alfred kerr he was accused of wallowing in hateful denouncements and erledigungen breakingsoffcitation needed along with karl valentin he is considered a master of gallows humor giorgio agamben compared guy debord and kraus for their criticism of journalists and media culture gregor von rezzori wrote of kraus his life stands as an example of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes in no matter what language i had the privilege of listening to his conversation and watching his face lit up by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the german language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly krauss work has been described as the culmination of a literary outlook critic frank field quoted the words bertolt brecht wrote of kraus on hearing of his death as the epoch raised its hand to end its own life he was the hand selected worksedit die

june   aged  vienna karl kraus april   – june   was an austrian writer and journalist known as a satirist essayist aphorist playwright and poet he directed his satire at the press german culture and german and austrian politics the austrian author stefan zweig once called kraus the master of venomous ridicule der meister des giftigen spotts he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature three times contents  biography  early life  career  before   –  –  –  character  selected works  works in english translation  references  citations  sources  external links biographyedit early lifeedit kraus was born into the wealthy jewish family of jacob kraus a papermaker and his wife ernestine née kantor in jičín austrianhungarian empire now the czech republic the family moved to vienna in  his mother died in  kraus enrolled as a law student at the university of vienna in  beginning in april of the same year he began contributing to the paper wiener literaturzeitung starting with a critique of gerhart hauptmanns the weavers around that time he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater in  he changed his field of studies to philosophy and german literature he discontinued his studies in  his friendship with peter altenberg began about this time careeredit before edit first issue of die fackel in  kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor stage director and performer joining the young vienna group which included peter altenberg leopold andrian hermann bahr richard beerhofmann arthur schnitzler hugo von hofmannsthal and felix salten in  kraus broke from this group with a biting satire die demolierte literatur demolished literature and was named vienna correspondent for the newspaper breslauer zeitung one year later as an uncompromising advocate of jewish assimilation he attacked the founder of modern zionism theodor herzl with his polemic eine krone für zion a crown for zion the title is a play on words in that krone means both crown and the currency of austriahungary from  to  one krone was the minimum donation required to participate in the zionist congress in basel and herzl was often mocked as the king of zion könig von zion by viennese antizionists on april   kraus renounced judaism and in the same year he founded his own newspaper die fackel de the torch which he continued to direct publish and write until his death and from which he launched his attacks on hypocrisy psychoanalysis corruption of the habsburg empire nationalism of the pangerman movement laissezfaire economic policies and numerous other subjects –edit in  kraus was sued by hermann bahr and emmerich bukovics who felt they had been attacked in die fackel many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years also in  kraus found out that his publisher moriz frisch had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a monthslong journey frisch had registered the magazines front cover as a trademark and published the neue fackel new torch kraus sued and won from that time die fackel was published without a cover page by the printer jahoda  siegel while die fackel at first resembled journals like die weltbühne it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its editorial independence thanks to krauss financial independence die fackel printed what kraus wanted to be printed in its first decade contributors included such wellknown writers and artists as peter altenberg richard dehmel egon friedell oskar kokoschka else laskerschüler adolf loos heinrich mann arnold schönberg august strindberg georg trakl frank wedekind franz werfel houston stewart chamberlain and oscar wilde after  however kraus was usually the sole author krauss work was published nearly exclusively in die fackel of which  irregularly issued numbers appeared in total authors who were supported by kraus include peter altenberg else laskerschüler and georg trakl die fackel targeted corruption journalists and brutish behaviour notable enemies were maximilian harden in the mud of the harden–eulenburg affair moriz benedikt owner of the newspaper neue freie presse alfred kerr hermann bahr imre bekessy de and johann schober in  kraus published sittlichkeit und kriminalität morality and criminal justice for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice der skandal fängt an wenn die polizei ihm ein ende macht the scandal starts when the police ends it starting in  kraus published the first of his aphorisms in die fackel they were collected in  in the book sprüche und widersprüche sayings and gainsayings in addition to his writings kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career put on approximately  oneman performances between  and  in which he read from the dramas of bertolt brecht gerhart hauptmann johann nestroy goethe and shakespeare and also performed offenbachs operettas accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself elias canetti who regularly attended krauss lectures titled the second volume of his autobiography die fackel im ohr the torch in the ear in reference to the magazine and its author at the peak of his popularity krauss lectures attracted four thousand people and his magazine sold forty thousand copies in  kraus supported frank wedekind to make possible the staging in vienna of his controversial play pandoras box the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in german society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution these plays frank depiction of sexuality and violence including lesbianism and an encounter with jack the ripper pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time wedekinds works are considered among the precursors of expressionism but in  when expressionist poets like richard dehmel began producing war propaganda kraus became a fierce critic of them in  kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor maximilian harden because of his role in the eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular erledigungen dispatchescitation needed –edit after  kraus was the sole author of most issues of die fackel one of krauss most influential satiricalliterary techniques was his détournement of quotations one controversy arose with the text die orgie which exposed how the newspaper neue freie presse was blatantly supporting austrias liberal partys election campaign the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper die fackel would publish it later in  the enraged editor who fell for the trick responded by suing kraus for disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors after an obituary for franz ferdinand who had been assassinated in sarajevo on  june  die fackel was not published for many months in december  it appeared again with an essay in dieser großen zeit in this grand time in dieser großen zeit die ich noch gekannt habe wie sie so klein war die wieder klein werden wird wenn ihr dazu noch zeit bleibt … in dieser lauten zeit die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen symphonie der taten die berichte hervorbringen und der berichte welche taten verschulden in dieser da mögen sie von mir kein eigenes wort erwarten in this grand time which i used to know when it was this small which will become small again if there is time … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports and of reports that cause deeds in this one you may not expect a word of my own in the subsequent time kraus wrote against the world war and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of die fackel krauss masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the first world war die letzten tage der menschheit the last days of mankind which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary by two characters called the grumbler and the optimist kraus began to write the play in  and first published it as a series of special fackel issues in  its epilogue die letzte nacht the last night had already been published in  as a special issue edward timms has called the work a faulted masterpiece and a fissured text because the evolution of krauss attitude during the time of its composition from aristocratic conservative to democratic republican gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a geological fault also in  kraus published his collected war texts under the title weltgericht world court of justice in  he published the satire literatur oder man wird doch da sehn literature or you aint seen nothing yet as a reply to franz werfels spiegelmensch mirror man an attack against krauscitation needed plaque of karl kraus on the house where he was born in jičín –edit during january  kraus started a fight against imre békessy publisher of the tabloid die stunde the hour accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him békessy retaliated with a libel campaign against kraus who in turn launched an erledigung with the catchphrase hinaus aus wien mit dem schuft throw the scoundrel out of vienna in  békessy indeed fled vienna to avoid arrest békessy achieved some later success when his novel barabbas was the monthly selection of an american book clubcitation needed a peak in krauss political commitment was his sensational attack in  on the powerful vienna police chief johann schober also a former twoterm chancellor after  people were shot dead in the police massacre of the july revolt kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested schobers resignation the poster was published all over vienna and is considered an icon of thcentury austrian history in  the play die unüberwindlichen the insurmountables was published it included allusions to the fights against békessy and schober during that same year kraus also published the records of a lawsuit kerr had filed against him after kraus had published kerrs war poems in die fackel kerr having become a pacifist did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed in  kraus translated shakespeares sonnets kraus supported the social democratic party of austria from at least the early s and in  hoping engelbert dollfuss could prevent nazism from engulfing austria he supported dollfusss coup détat which established the austrian fascist regime this support estranged kraus from some of his followers in  kraus wrote die dritte walpurgisnacht the third walpurgis night of which the first fragments appeared in die fackel kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to hitler who still lived in the third reich from nazi reprisals and in part because violence is no subject for polemic this satire on nazi ideology begins with the nowfamous sentence mir fällt zu hitler nichts ein hitler brings nothing to my mind lengthy extracts appear in krauss apologia for his silence at hitlers coming to power warum die fackel nicht erscheint why die fackel is not published a page edition of the periodical the last issue of die fackel appeared in february  kraus died of an embolism of the heart in vienna on june   after a short illness kraus never married but from  until his death he had a conflictprone but close relationship with the baroness sidonie nádherný von borutin – many of his works were written in janowitz castle nádherny family property sidonie nádherny became an important pen pal to kraus and addressee of his books and poems in  kraus was baptized as a catholic but in  disillusioned by the churchs support for the war he left the catholic church claiming sarcastically that he was motivated primarily by antisemitism ie indignation at max reinhardts use of the kollegienkirche in salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance kraus is buried in the zentralfriedhof cemetery outside vienna kraus was the subject of two books by thomas szasz karl kraus and the soul doctors and antifreud karl krauss criticism of psychoanalysis and psychiatry which portray kraus as a harsh critic of sigmund freud and of psychoanalysis in general other commentators such as edward timms have argued that kraus respected freud though with reservations about the application of some of his theories and that his views were far less blackandwhite than szasz suggests characteredit karl kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime marcel reichranicki called him vain selfrighteous and selfimportant krauss followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience and reprinted die fackel in volume form years after it was first published a concern with language was central to krauss outlook and he viewed his contemporaries careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world viennese composer ernst krenek described meeting the writer in  at a time when people were generally decrying the japanese bombardment of shanghai i met karl kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems he said something like i know that everything is futile when the house is burning but i have to do this as long as it is at all possible for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place shanghai would not be burning up to  kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum as he considered the flaws of the right too selfevident to be worthy of his comment later his responses to the nazis included the third walpurgis night to the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship however he was a bitter misanthrope and poor wouldbe alfred kerr he was accused of wallowing in hateful denouncements and erledigungen breakingsoffcitation needed along with karl valentin he is considered a master of gallows humor giorgio agamben compared guy debord and kraus for their criticism of journalists and media culture gregor von rezzori wrote of kraus his life stands as an example of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes in no matter what language i had the privilege of listening to his conversation and watching his face lit up by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the german language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly krauss work has been described as the culmination of a literary outlook critic frank field quoted the words bertolt brecht wrote of kraus on hearing of his death as the epoch raised its hand to end its own life he was the hand selected worksedit die

june   aged  vienna karl kraus april   – june   was an austrian writer and journalist known as a satirist essayist aphorist playwright and poet he directed his satire at the press german culture and german and austrian politics the austrian author stefan zweig once called kraus the master of venomous ridicule der meister des giftigen spotts he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature three times contents  biography  early life  career  before   –  –  –  character  selected works  works in english translation  references  citations  sources  external links biographyedit early lifeedit kraus was born into the wealthy jewish family of jacob kraus a papermaker and his wife ernestine née kantor in jičín austrianhungarian empire now the czech republic the family moved to vienna in  his mother died in  kraus enrolled as a law student at the university of vienna in  beginning in april of the same year he began contributing to the paper wiener literaturzeitung starting with a critique of gerhart hauptmanns the weavers around that time he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater in  he changed his field of studies to philosophy and german literature he discontinued his studies in  his friendship with peter altenberg began about this time careeredit before edit first issue of die fackel in  kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor stage director and performer joining the young vienna group which included peter altenberg leopold andrian hermann bahr richard beerhofmann arthur schnitzler hugo von hofmannsthal and felix salten in  kraus broke from this group with a biting satire die demolierte literatur demolished literature and was named vienna correspondent for the newspaper breslauer zeitung one year later as an uncompromising advocate of jewish assimilation he attacked the founder of modern zionism theodor herzl with his polemic eine krone für zion a crown for zion the title is a play on words in that krone means both crown and the currency of austriahungary from  to  one krone was the minimum donation required to participate in the zionist congress in basel and herzl was often mocked as the king of zion könig von zion by viennese antizionists on april   kraus renounced judaism and in the same year he founded his own newspaper die fackel de the torch which he continued to direct publish and write until his death and from which he launched his attacks on hypocrisy psychoanalysis corruption of the habsburg empire nationalism of the pangerman movement laissezfaire economic policies and numerous other subjects –edit in  kraus was sued by hermann bahr and emmerich bukovics who felt they had been attacked in die fackel many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years also in  kraus found out that his publisher moriz frisch had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a monthslong journey frisch had registered the magazines front cover as a trademark and published the neue fackel new torch kraus sued and won from that time die fackel was published without a cover page by the printer jahoda  siegel while die fackel at first resembled journals like die weltbühne it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its editorial independence thanks to krauss financial independence die fackel printed what kraus wanted to be printed in its first decade contributors included such wellknown writers and artists as peter altenberg richard dehmel egon friedell oskar kokoschka else laskerschüler adolf loos heinrich mann arnold schönberg august strindberg georg trakl frank wedekind franz werfel houston stewart chamberlain and oscar wilde after  however kraus was usually the sole author krauss work was published nearly exclusively in die fackel of which  irregularly issued numbers appeared in total authors who were supported by kraus include peter altenberg else laskerschüler and georg trakl die fackel targeted corruption journalists and brutish behaviour notable enemies were maximilian harden in the mud of the harden–eulenburg affair moriz benedikt owner of the newspaper neue freie presse alfred kerr hermann bahr imre bekessy de and johann schober in  kraus published sittlichkeit und kriminalität morality and criminal justice for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice der skandal fängt an wenn die polizei ihm ein ende macht the scandal starts when the police ends it starting in  kraus published the first of his aphorisms in die fackel they were collected in  in the book sprüche und widersprüche sayings and gainsayings in addition to his writings kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career put on approximately  oneman performances between  and  in which he read from the dramas of bertolt brecht gerhart hauptmann johann nestroy goethe and shakespeare and also performed offenbachs operettas accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself elias canetti who regularly attended krauss lectures titled the second volume of his autobiography die fackel im ohr the torch in the ear in reference to the magazine and its author at the peak of his popularity krauss lectures attracted four thousand people and his magazine sold forty thousand copies in  kraus supported frank wedekind to make possible the staging in vienna of his controversial play pandoras box the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in german society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution these plays frank depiction of sexuality and violence including lesbianism and an encounter with jack the ripper pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time wedekinds works are considered among the precursors of expressionism but in  when expressionist poets like richard dehmel began producing war propaganda kraus became a fierce critic of them in  kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor maximilian harden because of his role in the eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular erledigungen dispatchescitation needed –edit after  kraus was the sole author of most issues of die fackel one of krauss most influential satiricalliterary techniques was his détournement of quotations one controversy arose with the text die orgie which exposed how the newspaper neue freie presse was blatantly supporting austrias liberal partys election campaign the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper die fackel would publish it later in  the enraged editor who fell for the trick responded by suing kraus for disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors after an obituary for franz ferdinand who had been assassinated in sarajevo on  june  die fackel was not published for many months in december  it appeared again with an essay in dieser großen zeit in this grand time in dieser großen zeit die ich noch gekannt habe wie sie so klein war die wieder klein werden wird wenn ihr dazu noch zeit bleibt … in dieser lauten zeit die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen symphonie der taten die berichte hervorbringen und der berichte welche taten verschulden in dieser da mögen sie von mir kein eigenes wort erwarten in this grand time which i used to know when it was this small which will become small again if there is time … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports and of reports that cause deeds in this one you may not expect a word of my own in the subsequent time kraus wrote against the world war and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of die fackel krauss masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the first world war die letzten tage der menschheit the last days of mankind which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary by two characters called the grumbler and the optimist kraus began to write the play in  and first published it as a series of special fackel issues in  its epilogue die letzte nacht the last night had already been published in  as a special issue edward timms has called the work a faulted masterpiece and a fissured text because the evolution of krauss attitude during the time of its composition from aristocratic conservative to democratic republican gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a geological fault also in  kraus published his collected war texts under the title weltgericht world court of justice in  he published the satire literatur oder man wird doch da sehn literature or you aint seen nothing yet as a reply to franz werfels spiegelmensch mirror man an attack against krauscitation needed plaque of karl kraus on the house where he was born in jičín –edit during january  kraus started a fight against imre békessy publisher of the tabloid die stunde the hour accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him békessy retaliated with a libel campaign against kraus who in turn launched an erledigung with the catchphrase hinaus aus wien mit dem schuft throw the scoundrel out of vienna in  békessy indeed fled vienna to avoid arrest békessy achieved some later success when his novel barabbas was the monthly selection of an american book clubcitation needed a peak in krauss political commitment was his sensational attack in  on the powerful vienna police chief johann schober also a former twoterm chancellor after  people were shot dead in the police massacre of the july revolt kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested schobers resignation the poster was published all over vienna and is considered an icon of thcentury austrian history in  the play die unüberwindlichen the insurmountables was published it included allusions to the fights against békessy and schober during that same year kraus also published the records of a lawsuit kerr had filed against him after kraus had published kerrs war poems in die fackel kerr having become a pacifist did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed in  kraus translated shakespeares sonnets kraus supported the social democratic party of austria from at least the early s and in  hoping engelbert dollfuss could prevent nazism from engulfing austria he supported dollfusss coup détat which established the austrian fascist regime this support estranged kraus from some of his followers in  kraus wrote die dritte walpurgisnacht the third walpurgis night of which the first fragments appeared in die fackel kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to hitler who still lived in the third reich from nazi reprisals and in part because violence is no subject for polemic this satire on nazi ideology begins with the nowfamous sentence mir fällt zu hitler nichts ein hitler brings nothing to my mind lengthy extracts appear in krauss apologia for his silence at hitlers coming to power warum die fackel nicht erscheint why die fackel is not published a page edition of the periodical the last issue of die fackel appeared in february  kraus died of an embolism of the heart in vienna on june   after a short illness kraus never married but from  until his death he had a conflictprone but close relationship with the baroness sidonie nádherný von borutin – many of his works were written in janowitz castle nádherny family property sidonie nádherny became an important pen pal to kraus and addressee of his books and poems in  kraus was baptized as a catholic but in  disillusioned by the churchs support for the war he left the catholic church claiming sarcastically that he was motivated primarily by antisemitism ie indignation at max reinhardts use of the kollegienkirche in salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance kraus is buried in the zentralfriedhof cemetery outside vienna kraus was the subject of two books by thomas szasz karl kraus and the soul doctors and antifreud karl krauss criticism of psychoanalysis and psychiatry which portray kraus as a harsh critic of sigmund freud and of psychoanalysis in general other commentators such as edward timms have argued that kraus respected freud though with reservations about the application of some of his theories and that his views were far less blackandwhite than szasz suggests characteredit karl kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime marcel reichranicki called him vain selfrighteous and selfimportant krauss followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience and reprinted die fackel in volume form years after it was first published a concern with language was central to krauss outlook and he viewed his contemporaries careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world viennese composer ernst krenek described meeting the writer in  at a time when people were generally decrying the japanese bombardment of shanghai i met karl kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems he said something like i know that everything is futile when the house is burning but i have to do this as long as it is at all possible for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place shanghai would not be burning up to  kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum as he considered the flaws of the right too selfevident to be worthy of his comment later his responses to the nazis included the third walpurgis night to the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship however he was a bitter misanthrope and poor wouldbe alfred kerr he was accused of wallowing in hateful denouncements and erledigungen breakingsoffcitation needed along with karl valentin he is considered a master of gallows humor giorgio agamben compared guy debord and kraus for their criticism of journalists and media culture gregor von rezzori wrote of kraus his life stands as an example of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes in no matter what language i had the privilege of listening to his conversation and watching his face lit up by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the german language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly krauss work has been described as the culmination of a literary outlook critic frank field quoted the words bertolt brecht wrote of kraus on hearing of his death as the epoch raised its hand to end its own life he was the hand selected worksedit die

june   aged  vienna karl kraus april   – june   was an austrian writer and journalist known as a satirist essayist aphorist playwright and poet he directed his satire at the press german culture and german and austrian politics the austrian author stefan zweig once called kraus the master of venomous ridicule der meister des giftigen spotts he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature three times contents  biography  early life  career  before   –  –  –  character  selected works  works in english translation  references  citations  sources  external links biographyedit early lifeedit kraus was born into the wealthy jewish family of jacob kraus a papermaker and his wife ernestine née kantor in jičín austrianhungarian empire now the czech republic the family moved to vienna in  his mother died in  kraus enrolled as a law student at the university of vienna in  beginning in april of the same year he began contributing to the paper wiener literaturzeitung starting with a critique of gerhart hauptmanns the weavers around that time he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater in  he changed his field of studies to philosophy and german literature he discontinued his studies in  his friendship with peter altenberg began about this time careeredit before edit first issue of die fackel in  kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor stage director and performer joining the young vienna group which included peter altenberg leopold andrian hermann bahr richard beerhofmann arthur schnitzler hugo von hofmannsthal and felix salten in  kraus broke from this group with a biting satire die demolierte literatur demolished literature and was named vienna correspondent for the newspaper breslauer zeitung one year later as an uncompromising advocate of jewish assimilation he attacked the founder of modern zionism theodor herzl with his polemic eine krone für zion a crown for zion the title is a play on words in that krone means both crown and the currency of austriahungary from  to  one krone was the minimum donation required to participate in the zionist congress in basel and herzl was often mocked as the king of zion könig von zion by viennese antizionists on april   kraus renounced judaism and in the same year he founded his own newspaper die fackel de the torch which he continued to direct publish and write until his death and from which he launched his attacks on hypocrisy psychoanalysis corruption of the habsburg empire nationalism of the pangerman movement laissezfaire economic policies and numerous other subjects –edit in  kraus was sued by hermann bahr and emmerich bukovics who felt they had been attacked in die fackel many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years also in  kraus found out that his publisher moriz frisch had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a monthslong journey frisch had registered the magazines front cover as a trademark and published the neue fackel new torch kraus sued and won from that time die fackel was published without a cover page by the printer jahoda  siegel while die fackel at first resembled journals like die weltbühne it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its editorial independence thanks to krauss financial independence die fackel printed what kraus wanted to be printed in its first decade contributors included such wellknown writers and artists as peter altenberg richard dehmel egon friedell oskar kokoschka else laskerschüler adolf loos heinrich mann arnold schönberg august strindberg georg trakl frank wedekind franz werfel houston stewart chamberlain and oscar wilde after  however kraus was usually the sole author krauss work was published nearly exclusively in die fackel of which  irregularly issued numbers appeared in total authors who were supported by kraus include peter altenberg else laskerschüler and georg trakl die fackel targeted corruption journalists and brutish behaviour notable enemies were maximilian harden in the mud of the harden–eulenburg affair moriz benedikt owner of the newspaper neue freie presse alfred kerr hermann bahr imre bekessy de and johann schober in  kraus published sittlichkeit und kriminalität morality and criminal justice for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice der skandal fängt an wenn die polizei ihm ein ende macht the scandal starts when the police ends it starting in  kraus published the first of his aphorisms in die fackel they were collected in  in the book sprüche und widersprüche sayings and gainsayings in addition to his writings kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career put on approximately  oneman performances between  and  in which he read from the dramas of bertolt brecht gerhart hauptmann johann nestroy goethe and shakespeare and also performed offenbachs operettas accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself elias canetti who regularly attended krauss lectures titled the second volume of his autobiography die fackel im ohr the torch in the ear in reference to the magazine and its author at the peak of his popularity krauss lectures attracted four thousand people and his magazine sold forty thousand copies in  kraus supported frank wedekind to make possible the staging in vienna of his controversial play pandoras box the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in german society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution these plays frank depiction of sexuality and violence including lesbianism and an encounter with jack the ripper pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time wedekinds works are considered among the precursors of expressionism but in  when expressionist poets like richard dehmel began producing war propaganda kraus became a fierce critic of them in  kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor maximilian harden because of his role in the eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular erledigungen dispatchescitation needed –edit after  kraus was the sole author of most issues of die fackel one of krauss most influential satiricalliterary techniques was his détournement of quotations one controversy arose with the text die orgie which exposed how the newspaper neue freie presse was blatantly supporting austrias liberal partys election campaign the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper die fackel would publish it later in  the enraged editor who fell for the trick responded by suing kraus for disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors after an obituary for franz ferdinand who had been assassinated in sarajevo on  june  die fackel was not published for many months in december  it appeared again with an essay in dieser großen zeit in this grand time in dieser großen zeit die ich noch gekannt habe wie sie so klein war die wieder klein werden wird wenn ihr dazu noch zeit bleibt … in dieser lauten zeit die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen symphonie der taten die berichte hervorbringen und der berichte welche taten verschulden in dieser da mögen sie von mir kein eigenes wort erwarten in this grand time which i used to know when it was this small which will become small again if there is time … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports and of reports that cause deeds in this one you may not expect a word of my own in the subsequent time kraus wrote against the world war and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of die fackel krauss masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the first world war die letzten tage der menschheit the last days of mankind which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary by two characters called the grumbler and the optimist kraus began to write the play in  and first published it as a series of special fackel issues in  its epilogue die letzte nacht the last night had already been published in  as a special issue edward timms has called the work a faulted masterpiece and a fissured text because the evolution of krauss attitude during the time of its composition from aristocratic conservative to democratic republican gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a geological fault also in  kraus published his collected war texts under the title weltgericht world court of justice in  he published the satire literatur oder man wird doch da sehn literature or you aint seen nothing yet as a reply to franz werfels spiegelmensch mirror man an attack against krauscitation needed plaque of karl kraus on the house where he was born in jičín –edit during january  kraus started a fight against imre békessy publisher of the tabloid die stunde the hour accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him békessy retaliated with a libel campaign against kraus who in turn launched an erledigung with the catchphrase hinaus aus wien mit dem schuft throw the scoundrel out of vienna in  békessy indeed fled vienna to avoid arrest békessy achieved some later success when his novel barabbas was the monthly selection of an american book clubcitation needed a peak in krauss political commitment was his sensational attack in  on the powerful vienna police chief johann schober also a former twoterm chancellor after  people were shot dead in the police massacre of the july revolt kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested schobers resignation the poster was published all over vienna and is considered an icon of thcentury austrian history in  the play die unüberwindlichen the insurmountables was published it included allusions to the fights against békessy and schober during that same year kraus also published the records of a lawsuit kerr had filed against him after kraus had published kerrs war poems in die fackel kerr having become a pacifist did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed in  kraus translated shakespeares sonnets kraus supported the social democratic party of austria from at least the early s and in  hoping engelbert dollfuss could prevent nazism from engulfing austria he supported dollfusss coup détat which established the austrian fascist regime this support estranged kraus from some of his followers in  kraus wrote die dritte walpurgisnacht the third walpurgis night of which the first fragments appeared in die fackel kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to hitler who still lived in the third reich from nazi reprisals and in part because violence is no subject for polemic this satire on nazi ideology begins with the nowfamous sentence mir fällt zu hitler nichts ein hitler brings nothing to my mind lengthy extracts appear in krauss apologia for his silence at hitlers coming to power warum die fackel nicht erscheint why die fackel is not published a page edition of the periodical the last issue of die fackel appeared in february  kraus died of an embolism of the heart in vienna on june   after a short illness kraus never married but from  until his death he had a conflictprone but close relationship with the baroness sidonie nádherný von borutin – many of his works were written in janowitz castle nádherny family property sidonie nádherny became an important pen pal to kraus and addressee of his books and poems in  kraus was baptized as a catholic but in  disillusioned by the churchs support for the war he left the catholic church claiming sarcastically that he was motivated primarily by antisemitism ie indignation at max reinhardts use of the kollegienkirche in salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance kraus is buried in the zentralfriedhof cemetery outside vienna kraus was the subject of two books by thomas szasz karl kraus and the soul doctors and antifreud karl krauss criticism of psychoanalysis and psychiatry which portray kraus as a harsh critic of sigmund freud and of psychoanalysis in general other commentators such as edward timms have argued that kraus respected freud though with reservations about the application of some of his theories and that his views were far less blackandwhite than szasz suggests characteredit karl kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime marcel reichranicki called him vain selfrighteous and selfimportant krauss followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience and reprinted die fackel in volume form years after it was first published a concern with language was central to krauss outlook and he viewed his contemporaries careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world viennese composer ernst krenek described meeting the writer in  at a time when people were generally decrying the japanese bombardment of shanghai i met karl kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems he said something like i know that everything is futile when the house is burning but i have to do this as long as it is at all possible for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place shanghai would not be burning up to  kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum as he considered the flaws of the right too selfevident to be worthy of his comment later his responses to the nazis included the third walpurgis night to the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship however he was a bitter misanthrope and poor wouldbe alfred kerr he was accused of wallowing in hateful denouncements and erledigungen breakingsoffcitation needed along with karl valentin he is considered a master of gallows humor giorgio agamben compared guy debord and kraus for their criticism of journalists and media culture gregor von rezzori wrote of kraus his life stands as an example of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes in no matter what language i had the privilege of listening to his conversation and watching his face lit up by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the german language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly krauss work has been described as the culmination of a literary outlook critic frank field quoted the words bertolt brecht wrote of kraus on hearing of his death as the epoch raised its hand to end its own life he was the hand selected worksedit die

times contents  biography  early life  career  before   –  –  –  character  selected works  works in english translation  references  citations  sources  external links biographyedit early lifeedit kraus was born into the wealthy jewish family of jacob kraus a papermaker and his wife ernestine née kantor in jičín austrianhungarian empire now the czech republic the family moved to vienna in  his mother died in  kraus enrolled as a law student at the university of vienna in  beginning in april of the same year he began contributing to the paper wiener literaturzeitung starting with a critique of gerhart hauptmanns the weavers around that time he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater in  he changed his field of studies to philosophy and german literature he discontinued his studies in  his friendship with peter altenberg began about this time careeredit before edit first issue of die fackel in  kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor stage director and performer joining the young vienna group which included peter altenberg leopold andrian hermann bahr richard beerhofmann arthur schnitzler hugo von hofmannsthal and felix salten in  kraus broke from this group with a biting satire die demolierte literatur demolished literature and was named vienna correspondent for the newspaper breslauer zeitung one year later as an uncompromising advocate of jewish assimilation he attacked the founder of modern zionism theodor herzl with his polemic eine krone für zion a crown for zion the title is a play on words in that krone means both crown and the currency of austriahungary from  to  one krone was the minimum donation required to participate in the zionist congress in basel and herzl was often mocked as the king of zion könig von zion by viennese antizionists on april   kraus renounced judaism and in the same year he founded his own newspaper die fackel de the torch which he continued to direct publish and write until his death and from which he launched his attacks on hypocrisy psychoanalysis corruption of the habsburg empire nationalism of the pangerman movement laissezfaire economic policies and numerous other subjects –edit in  kraus was sued by hermann bahr and emmerich bukovics who felt they had been attacked in die fackel many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years also in  kraus found out that his publisher moriz frisch had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a monthslong journey frisch had registered the magazines front cover as a trademark and published the neue fackel new torch kraus sued and won from that time die fackel was published without a cover page by the printer jahoda  siegel while die fackel at first resembled journals like die weltbühne it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its editorial independence thanks to krauss financial independence die fackel printed what kraus wanted to be printed in its first decade contributors included such wellknown writers and artists as peter altenberg richard dehmel egon friedell oskar kokoschka else laskerschüler adolf loos heinrich mann arnold schönberg august strindberg georg trakl frank wedekind franz werfel houston stewart chamberlain and oscar wilde after  however kraus was usually the sole author krauss work was published nearly exclusively in die fackel of which  irregularly issued numbers appeared in total authors who were supported by kraus include peter altenberg else laskerschüler and georg trakl die fackel targeted corruption journalists and brutish behaviour notable enemies were maximilian harden in the mud of the harden–eulenburg affair moriz benedikt owner of the newspaper neue freie presse alfred kerr hermann bahr imre bekessy de and johann schober in  kraus published sittlichkeit und kriminalität morality and criminal justice for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice der skandal fängt an wenn die polizei ihm ein ende macht the scandal starts when the police ends it starting in  kraus published the first of his aphorisms in die fackel they were collected in  in the book sprüche und widersprüche sayings and gainsayings in addition to his writings kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career put on approximately  oneman performances between  and  in which he read from the dramas of bertolt brecht gerhart hauptmann johann nestroy goethe and shakespeare and also performed offenbachs operettas accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself elias canetti who regularly attended krauss lectures titled the second volume of his autobiography die fackel im ohr the torch in the ear in reference to the magazine and its author at the peak of his popularity krauss lectures attracted four thousand people and his magazine sold forty thousand copies in  kraus supported frank wedekind to make possible the staging in vienna of his controversial play pandoras box the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in german society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution these plays frank depiction of sexuality and violence including lesbianism and an encounter with jack the ripper pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time wedekinds works are considered among the precursors of expressionism but in  when expressionist poets like richard dehmel began producing war propaganda kraus became a fierce critic of them in  kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor maximilian harden because of his role in the eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular erledigungen dispatchescitation needed –edit after  kraus was the sole author of most issues of die fackel one of krauss most influential satiricalliterary techniques was his détournement of quotations one controversy arose with the text die orgie which exposed how the newspaper neue freie presse was blatantly supporting austrias liberal partys election campaign the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper die fackel would publish it later in  the enraged editor who fell for the trick responded by suing kraus for disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors after an obituary for franz ferdinand who had been assassinated in sarajevo on  june  die fackel was not published for many months in december  it appeared again with an essay in dieser großen zeit in this grand time in dieser großen zeit die ich noch gekannt habe wie sie so klein war die wieder klein werden wird wenn ihr dazu noch zeit bleibt … in dieser lauten zeit die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen symphonie der taten die berichte hervorbringen und der berichte welche taten verschulden in dieser da mögen sie von mir kein eigenes wort erwarten in this grand time which i used to know when it was this small which will become small again if there is time … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports and of reports that cause deeds in this one you may not expect a word of my own in the subsequent time kraus wrote against the world war and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of die fackel krauss masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the first world war die letzten tage der menschheit the last days of mankind which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary by two characters called the grumbler and the optimist kraus began to write the play in  and first published it as a series of special fackel issues in  its epilogue die letzte nacht the last night had already been published in  as a special issue edward timms has called the work a faulted masterpiece and a fissured text because the evolution of krauss attitude during the time of its composition from aristocratic conservative to democratic republican gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a geological fault also in  kraus published his collected war texts under the title weltgericht world court of justice in  he published the satire literatur oder man wird doch da sehn literature or you aint seen nothing yet as a reply to franz werfels spiegelmensch mirror man an attack against krauscitation needed plaque of karl kraus on the house where he was born in jičín –edit during january  kraus started a fight against imre békessy publisher of the tabloid die stunde the hour accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him békessy retaliated with a libel campaign against kraus who in turn launched an erledigung with the catchphrase hinaus aus wien mit dem schuft throw the scoundrel out of vienna in  békessy indeed fled vienna to avoid arrest békessy achieved some later success when his novel barabbas was the monthly selection of an american book clubcitation needed a peak in krauss political commitment was his sensational attack in  on the powerful vienna police chief johann schober also a former twoterm chancellor after  people were shot dead in the police massacre of the july revolt kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested schobers resignation the poster was published all over vienna and is considered an icon of thcentury austrian history in  the play die unüberwindlichen the insurmountables was published it included allusions to the fights against békessy and schober during that same year kraus also published the records of a lawsuit kerr had filed against him after kraus had published kerrs war poems in die fackel kerr having become a pacifist did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed in  kraus translated shakespeares sonnets kraus supported the social democratic party of austria from at least the early s and in  hoping engelbert dollfuss could prevent nazism from engulfing austria he supported dollfusss coup détat which established the austrian fascist regime this support estranged kraus from some of his followers in  kraus wrote die dritte walpurgisnacht the third walpurgis night of which the first fragments appeared in die fackel kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to hitler who still lived in the third reich from nazi reprisals and in part because violence is no subject for polemic this satire on nazi ideology begins with the nowfamous sentence mir fällt zu hitler nichts ein hitler brings nothing to my mind lengthy extracts appear in krauss apologia for his silence at hitlers coming to power warum die fackel nicht erscheint why die fackel is not published a page edition of the periodical the last issue of die fackel appeared in february  kraus died of an embolism of the heart in vienna on june   after a short illness kraus never married but from  until his death he had a conflictprone but close relationship with the baroness sidonie nádherný von borutin – many of his works were written in janowitz castle nádherny family property sidonie nádherny became an important pen pal to kraus and addressee of his books and poems in  kraus was baptized as a catholic but in  disillusioned by the churchs support for the war he left the catholic church claiming sarcastically that he was motivated primarily by antisemitism ie indignation at max reinhardts use of the kollegienkirche in salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance kraus is buried in the zentralfriedhof cemetery outside vienna kraus was the subject of two books by thomas szasz karl kraus and the soul doctors and antifreud karl krauss criticism of psychoanalysis and psychiatry which portray kraus as a harsh critic of sigmund freud and of psychoanalysis in general other commentators such as edward timms have argued that kraus respected freud though with reservations about the application of some of his theories and that his views were far less blackandwhite than szasz suggests characteredit karl kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime marcel reichranicki called him vain selfrighteous and selfimportant krauss followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience and reprinted die fackel in volume form years after it was first published a concern with language was central to krauss outlook and he viewed his contemporaries careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world viennese composer ernst krenek described meeting the writer in  at a time when people were generally decrying the japanese bombardment of shanghai i met karl kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems he said something like i know that everything is futile when the house is burning but i have to do this as long as it is at all possible for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place shanghai would not be burning up to  kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum as he considered the flaws of the right too selfevident to be worthy of his comment later his responses to the nazis included the third walpurgis night to the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship however he was a bitter misanthrope and poor wouldbe alfred kerr he was accused of wallowing in hateful denouncements and erledigungen breakingsoffcitation needed along with karl valentin he is considered a master of gallows humor giorgio agamben compared guy debord and kraus for their criticism of journalists and media culture gregor von rezzori wrote of kraus his life stands as an example of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes in no matter what language i had the privilege of listening to his conversation and watching his face lit up by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the german language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly krauss work has been described as the culmination of a literary outlook critic frank field quoted the words bertolt brecht wrote of kraus on hearing of his death as the epoch raised its hand to end its own life he was the hand selected worksedit die
