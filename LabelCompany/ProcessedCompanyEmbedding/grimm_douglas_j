have known it by his approach he was leading a business that had just gone through bankruptcy and was in the process of merging with two other companies who were in the same dire situation on top of that the global recession was taking hold and it appeared to many as if the sky really was falling but grimm didn’t see it that way he calmly set about integrating citation corp with grede foundries inc and blackhawk foundry to form a new company called grede holdings llc grimm went to work lining up integration teams and scheduling townhall meetings at each plant to communicate directly with all  employees who were going to be affected there was no panic even though the future did not look bright at all new vehicle sales were plunging to year lows and the manufacturer of gray and ductile iron castings desperately needed that to change but once again grimm was the calm in the storm the chairman president and ceo encouraged input from everyone and his goal was to identify best practices at every level of the organization he talked to everybody on a regular basis and met with customers too decisions would now be based on data and thoughtful dialogue and they would be tracked to make sure they were the right decisions if they weren’t they were analyzed to ensure that the same mistake wouldn’t be made again these steps got everyone moving in the same direction and created a company that
