digikey arrow future electronics wpg symphony link™ a revolutionary wireless system for widearea iot networks symphony link is a wireless solution for enterprise and industrial customers who need to securely connect their iot devices to the cloud it’s the only lpwa system with repeaters symphony link™ grows with you expand network range using powerefficient repeaters without impacting latency  acknowledgements symphony link™ acknowledges all uplink and downlink messages to ensure successful transmission from devices quality of service symphony link™ manages frequencies time slots node privilege and throughput to insure qos firmware overtheair symphony link™ economizes on resources by enabling patch security issue patches or new feature or bug fix management without physical human attention wifi and zigbee ranges are too limiting cellular is too expensive and powerhungry and most lpwan systems don’t have the features necessary for your application symphony link is specifically designed for low power widearea network lpwan applications that are easily scalable and perform with bestofclass reliability learn more about symphony link benefits how it works modules modules rlp optimized for batterypowered applications the rlp is an industrialgrade low power widearea lpwa module for symphony link connectivity this surfacemount module features an easytouse uart serial connection to the host the rlp is available with an internal trace antenna or can be used with the ufl or pin rf output it is ready to deploy with full fcc certifications rxr the rxr features a dbm output power and better frontend noise figure which makes it perfect for acpowered applications where additional signal margin is required it is available with or without an antenna and is ready to

indoor gateway llbst the industrialgrade symphony link gateway connects to hundreds or thousands of symphony link modules this powerful device manages security uplink and downlink and many advanced low power widearea lpwa features only available with symphony link for data backhaul the gateway features ethernet wifi g cellular or g lte the llbst is passively cooled and can be installed in the toughest industrial environments outdoor gateway this outdoor gateway is a true ip industrial temperaturerated gateway for use in harsh outdoor environments from parking lots to airports to oil fields the outdoor gateway can connect low power widearea lpwa devices across huge areas   symphony link iot conductor iot conductor symphony link iot conductor conductor is an enterprisegrade data and network management service for symphony link it provides a highly scalable global data infrastructure that makes building a symphony link application as easy as connecting to an api conductor manages longterm database storage downlink routing roaming sessions certificates pki security infrastructure and network infrastructure settings there is no cost to use conductor when testing and prototyping once in production it costs pennies a month for this worldclass data and network management platform login api api the conductor data and network management platform features a sophisticated apidriven interface users can access data by querying historical data via rest or receive realtime streams of data via pubsub zeromq or web sockets data access security can be managed via basic authentication or oauth tokens there is no perdevice key management required with symphony link all end devices need only to be set with the applicationwide token and the network access token this allows firmware to be exactly the same on all devices that are manufactured end user end user symphony link is used by enterprises around the world for highreliability industrial agricultural and asset management applications learn more about each use case defined area asset tracking industrial iot control inventory management symphony link development kit the symphony link development kit contains everything

most reliable lpwa technology on the market guaranteed message receipt because symphony link acknowledges every message you’ll know immediately if a message has been successfully transmitted from your device realtime power and data rate control before every symphony link transmission an end device calculates the reverse link to the gateway and adjusts its transmit power and modulation rate to match this way nodes throughout the network have a balanced link budget multiple gateway coexistence symphony link uses a dynamic channel mask controlled by the gateway ensuring as few collisions as possible bidirectional message acknowledgement symphony link’s adaptive acknowledgement encoder allows nodes to transmit less frequently which saves battery power and increases system reliability interference avoidance up to  gateways and their star networks can coexist in the mhz ism band without affecting performance or adding redundant receive channels this means adding a gateway truly increases capacity unlike other lpwan systems utilize flexible architecture that fits your enterprise or industrial solution extensible api symphony link end users have the option of adding functionality directly into the gateway through an api which allows for systems that receive a message from a local node to immediately process and generate a response without any internet connection decentralized architecture symphony link gateways perform a large portion of network processing locally eliminating the need for a single intensive processing server this means gateways can continue performing most of their functions during a network outage or in a disconnected state ensuring no data is lost once the network is running again obtain governmentgrade security for your iot application right out of the box public key infrastructure pki this overtheair wireless channel used by symphony link is considered unbreakable by nsa standards thus preventing spoofing and assuring the identity of the infrastructure firmware overtheair the ability to patch vulnerabilities without physical device access lowers the cost lowers the risk of deployment and greatly improves security realtime advanced encryption standard aes key exchange bankgrade transport level security tls for network traffic easily deploy your network without the hassle of other lpwa networks present repeaters expand the range of your symphony link network dramatically without impacting latency repeaters cost much less than an outdoor access point allowing symphony link customers to cover larger areas without spending additional thousands on infrastructure they are also powerefficient and can be solar or batterypowered no perdevice configuration one of the biggest frustrations you can have when deploying a different lpwa network is managing multiple perdevice encryption keys at the time of production and on the server side with symphony link the host device configuration is the same for all devices of the same type and key exchange is handled via our worldclass pkibased diffie hellman aes architecture gateway roaming with symphony link nodes can easily roam from one gateway to another by scanning for availability as your capacity grows you can swap out small singlechannel gateways with highcapacity replacements send your data quickly and efficiently and enjoy four times the capacity of lorawan realtime adaptive data rate symphony link is a synchronous system which allows end nodes to determine what data rate to utilize on a framebyframe basis when the link is strong messages are fast to save power when the link is weak messages automatically lengthen to ensure delivery no duty cycle limit a duty cycle limit prevents other technologies from being able to send large quantities of data at one time—a restriction symphony link does not have quality of service so an important alarm message doesn’t have to compete with a water meter message for channel access symphony link nodes with important traffic have priority fixed mtu of  bytes the symphony link protocol handles all of the subpacketization and retries to send a message when necessary to ensure delivery how is symphony
