the zone” it occurs when our minds are so involved in what we are doing that we do not have enough attentional “bandwidth” to monitor how we are feeling or listen to our mental chatter it is typically produced while doing activities or tasks that require immense concentration and balance the level of challenge with our skill flow leaves us feeling energized relaxed and happypractice finding flowdue
