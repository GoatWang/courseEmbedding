 crowdfunding commercial reits home  real estate  rich uncles review rich uncles review – combining crowdfunding and commercial reits review of rich uncles reviewed by ruth lyons published on july   last modified july   editor rating rated  stars rich uncles is a public nontraded real estate investment trust reit you dont need to be accredited to invest the tenants are screened and you can get in with a low minimum investment however this is a longterm investment which might not please traders who want quick returns or exit using a crowdfunding platform to raise capital is a popular new concept in real estate investing including real estate investment trusts reits crowdfunding makes property funding easier and faster than going through the traditional routes of finding bank financing or investors with large amounts of capital who are interested in specific opportunities it also opens up real estate investing to people who have only small amounts of money to invest rich uncles’ business model allows everyone the opportunity to own commercial real estate through an investment in their nnn reit what is rich uncles rich uncles provides an online platform for investors to buy shares of their singletenant commercial property reit called the rich uncles nnn reit the reit is invested in property leased by retail businesses such as gas stations drugstores and grocery stores that pay monthly rent the collected rent is distributed to shareholders monthly as dividend income rich uncles’ platform provides photos and details about the properties in the reit while you don’t pick specific properties to invest in — there’s one reit that holds these properties and you invest in the reit itself — you can get a good feel for the portfolio holdings by reviewing the details of the individual properties online rich uncles’ portfolio rich uncles acquires and holds commercial properties that meet specific criteria to reduce risk and provide reliable rental income specifically they seek singletenant properties located in primary secondary and certain tertiary markets where construction is substantially complete to reduce risk associated with new construction leased on a “triple net” basis where the tenant is responsible for the payment of taxes insurance and maintenance leased to tenants with strong financial statements including investmentgrade credit quality and subject to longterm leases with defined rental rate increases according to cofounder howard makler rich uncles gives small investors the opportunity to “invest alongside the chairman of the world’s largest commercial real estate company and a handpicked team of experts that know the world of real estate inside and out” rich uncles’ founding investor is raymond wirta former chairman of cbre nysecbg a global real estate services firm rounding out the management team is ceo harold hofer a lawyer who has participated in real estate transactions as a principal and as a broker valued in excess of  billion in his year real estate to understand rich uncles’ product offering it’s important to understand the difference between a traded reit and a public nontraded reit rich uncles being a public nontraded reit quick comparison  —read the reviewread the reviewrating rated  stars rated  stars rated  stars min depositfeesfreeyear  yearaccredited investornonono a real estate investment trust or reit is a corporation that takes capital from many different investors and uses it to buy incomeproducing real estate in general a reit is an entity that combines the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for real estate investments allows individual investors to invest in a professionally managed largescale diversified portfolio of real estate pays distributions to investors of at least  of its annual reit taxable income and avoids the “double taxation” treatment of investment income because a reit is not generally subject to federal corporate income taxes on the portion of income distributed to its stockholders shares in public reits are available to any investor through the stock market can be purchased from any registered investment broker and are considered to be liquid — the shares trade on the stock market exchanges and therefore can be bought and sold quickly there are hundreds of public reits on vanguard fidelity schwab and other brokerage houses from which you can choose rich uncles’ offering nnn reit inc is classified as a public nontraded reit the distinction is they are “public” to the extent they are registered with the sec so the public can view their offering but they do not trade on the open market as do the public reit shares you purchase from an investment broker typically the sponsor of a public nontraded reit has an inhouse dealermanager that is responsible for marketing shares to finralicensed brokerdealers and secregulated investment advisors which results in substantial fees these fees typically include  to  sales commissions paid to the brokerdealer for soliciting the investment  to  commission paid to the dealer managing the sales effort and  to  paid to the brokerdealer for costs associated with a due diligence review of the offering all these commissions and reimbursements mean approximately – of the cost of the typical nontraded reit is spent on brokerdealer and dealermanager costs leaving only – of investment dollars being placed into actual real estate rich uncles llc was founded for “a single purpose — to make real estate investment easier and less expensive for the small investor” instead of using the typical brokerdealer distribution channel and paying advisory intermediaries rich uncles uses crowdfunding and the internet to market their reit directly to investors rich uncles believes that with the ease and transparency of the internet the company can deliver a real estate product that has roughly  more of the investment amount actually being invested in real estate rather than being paid to others in the form of commissions and reimbursements rich uncles features minimum investment  fees none accredited investor no reits yes offering types equity property types commercial return — historically rich uncles has distributed a  annualized dividend on a monthly basis this is an increase from the  annualized dividend they offered when their nnn reit first launched in july  the hypothetical earnings found on their website assume you reinvest your dividends over five years rich uncles — possible earnings liquidity — rich uncles’ reit provides a share redemption program that can be accessed through your shareholder dashboard you have the option of selling back your shares to rich uncles this aspect of their offering was developed in order to meet the market’s demand for a real estate investment product that did not follow the ebb and flow of the traditional stock market but still provided a level of liquidity traditional commercial real estate can’t match in this sense rich uncles’ model adds liquidity to a previously illiquid product longterm investment — when you invest you are committing to being part owner of many commercial real estate properties real estate is a longterm investment when the fund reaches its cap of investor capital — typically – years — a fund liquidation event takes place and investment proceeds are distributed you get your value back — what your shares are worth at the time plus profits from the proceeds of the sale of all the buildings owned by the fund rich uncles is considered an “openended” fund meaning there is no set liquidation date it is up to the principals of rich uncles to determine the appropriate time and circumstances for portfolio liquidation rich uncles has their shares revalued by an independent third party appraisal firm on an annual basis which allows their investors the chance to benefit from increases in property value over time  cash equity ownership in all owned properties — rich uncles limits their mortgage debt by buying properties with  cash down payments which means they carry  cash equity ownership in their entire real estate portfolio dividend reinvestment option — you can choose to have your monthly dividends automatically reinvested and compound your ownership no broker commissions no investor fees — because rich uncles doesn’t use brokers they do not pay commissions instead choosing to use crowdfunding to find investors which reduces their overhead and increases the percentage of returns they can distribute to their members “triplenet leases” — rich uncles buys commercial properties where tenants are responsible for paying all propertyrelated expenses including taxes insurance and maintenance availability — rich uncles nnn reit is currently available to residents of ca co ct fl ga hi id il in ky la mt nh nv ny sd tx ut vt wi wy pros no reit expenses — typically publictraded reits pay subordinated performance fees equal to  of the amounts by which asset sale proceeds exceed the amounts paid to purchase shares and a return of their invested capital plus a  cumulative noncompounded annual return on invested capital rich uncles charges none of these customary fees they completely skip the middleman — and his commissions — by marketing directly to investors through their crowdfunding platform you make money or rich uncles doesn’t get paid — unlike your typical portfolio manager or broker who collects his monthly management fee or commissions whether he makes money for you or not rich uncles’ business model is performance based the first  of profits is paid out to shareholders — rich uncles makes money only if the investments deliver — and their share is  of profits once the investment exceeds the  hurdle truly passive real estate alternative — rich uncles reit is a truly passive real estate investment you invest in the reit and rich uncles does all the legwork and paperwork associated with owning leasing and managing commercial properties paying you cash dividends on a monthly basis no need to be accredited — you don’t need to be an accredited investor rich uncles asks only that you have a combined family income of k or a net worth of at least k suitability standards differ slightly from state to state but richunclescom walks investors through the requirements of their state of residence highquality tenants — rich uncles invests only in singletenant commercial properties with existing longterm leases they don’t buy vacant buildings and find tenants they don’t invest in distressed properties and rehab them they acquire only three types of properties — office retail and industrial — which are already leased to high quality tenants  equity reduces real estate mortgage risk — rich uncles only acquires properties with  equity that would be like you putting a  down payment when you buy your home geographical diversification reduces real estate exposure risk — rich uncles’ strategy is to acquire properties across the country thereby reducing the risks of any one market by diversifying their holdings geographically low minimum investment — the minimum investment of  opens it up to many more people than most commercial real estate crowdfunding platforms monthly dividends — like a dividendpaying stock rich uncles reit provides steady monthly dividend income under normal circumstances you can choose to receive your dividends in cash or reinvest them cons investment liquidity — once you make an investment you are pretty much committed to the investment for the term there is currently no secondary market to sell your investment to others longterm investment — while some investors have turned to nontraded reits to sidestep stock market risk it’s important to understand you give up some liquidity at the same time real estate is longerterm investment you don’t really know what your shares are worth until the very end when the property sells or rich uncles conducts its annual asset appraisal and adjusts share value accordingly monthly dividends are not guaranteed — this can be said of any dividend really there are no guarantees when it comes to investing and that includes the monthly payouts from rich uncles rich uncles’  equity model greatly diminishes the chance of foreclosure on any of their holdings and their tenant screening process ensures credit worthiness but there is still a chance tenants will fail to pay their rent which would mean there is no rental income to distribute their website requires an account even to “learn more” — when you click on their links of “learn more” or “how it works” you are given the option to create a login if you don’t want to create a login you don’t get to see more about the company summary rich uncles’ reit investing strategy is to buy commercial real estate with at least  cash down rent the spaces to reliable companies with longterm leases and pay out the rental income to their reit shareholders via monthly dividends similar to fundrise which we reviewed a few months ago rich uncles reits give investors access to real estate deals without the high dollar commitment typically needed without being an accredited investor and without paying the high frontend load fees typically charged by reits rich uncles’ business model is an investor’s dream in the sense that unlike brokers who get paid commission whether they make you money or not rich uncles is incentivized to make money for you the company is entitled to profits only after the reit delivers a return of  to shareholders purchasing shares of rich uncles nnn reit inc involves some risk including the fact that rich uncles is a new company with a limited track

scam   richunclescom from  reviews review it   rich uncle’s found online at richunclescom is a company who says their goal is to create a platform that makes real estate investment accessible for everyone who wants to get involved traditionally speaking real estate investment was thought to only be available to people who had large sums of investment capital that they could translate into large stakes in investment opportunities rich uncle’s has a goal of making this type of investment available to people with different levels of capital available so this type of investment opportunity is no longer off limits to the general public how does it work the whole concept of rich uncle’s rests on something called a real estate investment trust or reit which is a corporation that takes capital from many different investors and uses it to buy and then operate income producing real estate in addition reits are exempt from taxes if certain standards can be met including the distribution of at least  of the taxable income reits make this possible by generating and distributing this income to their shareholders in dividends finally this company does not pay commissions instead choosing to use the internet for advertising and finding investors which reduces their overhead and increases the percentage of returns they distribute to their members is this a legitimate opportunity this company is funding real estate investment opportunities through a specific type of a crowdfunding platform they say that their potential investors can begin purchasing ownership in reits with investments of just  using the crowdfunding platform to raise capital for real estate opportunities is becoming a popular new concept in real estate investing it not only opens up real estate investing to people who only have small amounts of money to invest but it is beneficial for the properties and owners themselves crowdfunding often allows these properties to be funded easier and faster than going through the traditional routes of finding bank funding or investors with large amounts of capital who are interested in the opportunity so this type of real estate investment is growing in acceptability and popularity and people who are interested in it can look at the opportunities available through rich uncle’s or other companies that take a similar approach if youre at

standing with the sec bbb and our independent auditors ernst  young since inception a further technical response regarding understand your  is listed below the form div that you received from rich uncles nnn reit showed both “total ordinary dividends” and “nondividend distributions” this is primarily due to property depreciation deductions current tax codes allow real estate owners to depreciate or write off the costs of a property’s improvements ie the bricks and mortar but not underlying ground over a certain time frame this is effectively a paper loss and is one of the benefits of owning commercial real estate nnn reit’s business model is to acquire properties in advance of selling reit shares using the reit’s acquisition line of credit as reit shares are sold the line of credit is correspondingly reduced we use this strategy to ensure that the proceeds from reit shares sold are immediately deployed into dividend yieldgenerating real estate ownership and not deposited into an escrow account until enough shares are sold to purchase the next property nnn reit purchased its first properties in june of last year utilizing the reit’s line of credit depreciation deductions began to accrue then prior to selling any reit shares the line of credit was also employed to purchase our dollar general portfolio in november and our dana inc acquisition in december the line of credit balance was reduced to  last week repaid from the proceeds of reit shares sold but we are about to dip into the line again to purchase our next asset a consequence of our buyfirst sell reit sharesnext strategy is that the reit built up depreciation deductions in  that fully “tax sheltered” the dividends that were paid to shareholders these depreciation deductions have reduced your tax or “cost” basis in your reit shares investment and under current irs codes you will be taxed at capital gains rates on the difference between your ultimate sales price of your reit shares and your cost basis we trust that this clarifies any misunderstanding that you may have had it is important to note that no reit share offering proceeds were used to pay dividends all dividend were paid from property rental receipts replyget me out saysmarch rd  at  amyou are so full of crap any “paper” depreciation at this time will subject the holder to hell of a liability when the underlying properties

reviews i invested  then i went and did some research of my own and have found that sure enough it is not a dividend the reviews are correct it is a “return of capital ” which is legal but it’s very deceptive this company is set up to make the founders money not the shareholders the return of capital will lower your bases which in turn will cost you money find a publicly traded reit don’t invest

this company will be out of business at some point reply johnny rocket says october st  at  am stay away if their offering was a good deal it would have been snapped up by institutional investors and how can they “guarantee” a  return in a  world and you need to think about why anyone would risk their money buying real estate from a radio commercial or website also it takes up to three months or longer to have your money returned if you decide to sell and they are not a public reit regardless of what they tell you they are “public” to the extent they are registered with the sec so the public can view their offering but they do not trade on the open market such as any legitimate reit would…xlre and many others if you are a novice investor i suggest you contact a certified financial planner cfp who is also a fiduciary which means they are in business to serve you and not their best interests they can review this with you and i am certain they will tell you essentially what i have written you must complete your due diligence before making any decision like this good luck replydouglas j lewis cfp saysoctober th  at  pmyou are correct the nontraded reits are public but not traded on stock exchanges there are private reits also which are not traded on stock exchanges the fact that this one is public tells you the reporting to the sec is required as far as safety the public reits are safer than the private reits however there is another risk in the traded public reits that the nontraded ones avoid this is the daily potential drop in the value of your investment the value of your nontraded reit is not subject to marketability also do not confuse the income your monthly distribution from your reit with your return you should be interested in knowing how much is your monthly income going to be although not guaranteed how long your income period will be how many years and when will there be a liquidity event this liquidity event is the most crucial during the operational period of your reit you are receiving a percentage return on your investment then at liquidity you will find out what percentage receive of your investment if you receive  return upon liquidity this turned out to be a good investment there are some excellent nontraded reits and some lousy ones the prospectus is the best way to understand the risks as a certified financial planner i always begin my due diligence here then i go a lot further utilizing other due diligence attorney firms to get their written evaluations so far the biggest risk i see with this risk is the lack of any information on a liquidity event other risks i have found are with regard to the sponsors mark says september th  at  pm was planning to move some money here from a few bank accounts earning nothing

received xlre yesterday sold it today with a charge pf  and will receive all my funds by tuesday of next week there are several posters below who state it takes up to three months to receive funds from rich uncles when you decide to sell why would anyone invest here when you can do so in a publically traded reit and do it on line in a millisecond and i knew exactly what my sale price was at the instant i sold the fund shares that is something you cannot find out at ru regardless of how often you ask nor will they inform you of the value of your ru shares while you own them and remember as a private reit rich uncles is not under the same rules and regulations as a public reit which means you have no protections no governmental over site or review to ensure they act as a fiduciary and in

from golden gate university never never never says august th  at  pm for anyone thinking to invest here you must complete your due diligence first read all the negative reviews and then ask yourself if this is such a great deal why are the negatives so numerous the answer is that this is not a low risk enterprise there are no legal protections for you there is no governmental oversight or review to ensure adherence to industry and fiduciary standards in addition as one commenter stated it took three months to sell his investment and receive the funds if you invest do so with a public reit which ru is not despite the owners comments you can buy a public reit on monday decide its not for you and sell on tuesday and have the funds in your account by friday or early the following week since ru is a non traded reit you must go through them to find a buyer and who knows how long that could take and you do not know at any given time the value of your shares since this is a private business and not subject to the same rules as a pullic reit you must be certain you fully understand exactly what the risks are and decide if they justify lending them your money and remember a public reit is traded in the public stock market just like any other stock and ru is not traded that alone is a giant red flag that something is very wrong here caveat emptor replyuchgo mba yale jd saysaugust th  at  amnever never is correct the reason real estate is such a good investment is because of a very large noncash deduction — depreciation — that serves to reduce the taxable income from the rents in other words real estate has two types of income broadly speaking taxable income — the rents and similar cash flows in excess of deductions — and nontaxable cashflow — from depreciation the investors are only paid out of the taxable income which may be a quite small portion of total cashflow the promoters keep the rest potentially depending on how much cash the offering receives the promoters may buy real estate for  cash all from the investors but receive nearly all of the cashflow another twist on that approach would be for the promoters to take a mortgage on the already purchased real estate and pay those cash proceeds to themselves none would be required to be paid to the investors because mortgage proceeds are not taxable income as never never points out owning a nonpublic reit is kind of like owning a timeshare at a resort you might not be able to sell it rating    stay away says august th  at  pm the president says there are no sales people but the “costumer

have way to many accounting glitches and their sales people are way to aggressive also when i looked at my  from last year there was no income and yes all divideds have been return of capital

not their rich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmunproven we have been around for for years now their are no hidden fees as everything is outlined in the prospectus the fees we charge for asset management

is posting numerous reviews replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmour expense reimbursement is strictly limited to  one time any other losses are borne by the llc owners not the reit investors the

opinion on this investment when i looked at the  my client paid no taxes because there was no income when i look at the dividend it is not a dividend is a return of capital i further looked at the financials and the financials look like they are losing money then i just decided to do simple math i called a friend at clear channel worldwide and they said that before they went to national they were spending about  per month on advertising that’s about   million dollars per year then you add that they have about  employees that’s probably a cost of  million including insurance bonuses time off and special events then from what i understand they have some pretty fancy offices when i look at the location and the square footage of the two offices that they have there probably spending about another million dollars a year minimum on offices these are probably all lowballing the costs are probably much more than this but when i add that all up plus the fact that they’re saying theyre giving a   dividend but they have about  million under management that they have raised over a fouryear period i don’t see sustainability of this company i don’t think that we can really call this a ponzi scheme but it seems like to me there is a mismanagement of money perhaps when they reach about a  million mark or even a  million mark of properties under management they will be profitable but at this point i do not think it’s a very good investment replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmthe reits themselves have always been profitable enough to cover all dividend payments from rental income received and profit from real property sales never have we paid a dividend from return of capital keep in mind we are real estate experts… if you knew the terms of our office space lease you would be impressed offices were built for very little money and our entire operation is very frugal advertising costs are not the responsibility of reit property owners as they are protected by a  cap on all expense contributions instead of paying a  commission we charge  instead of paying a  expense contribution we charge  very fair indeed rating    joe says august th  at  pm full disclosure i have not yet invested but am currently researching this as a way to diversify my investments in k roth ira stock brokerage account  plan and home equity the research i have done i am a finance professional with a degree in finance and an mba is all positive thus far this is a legit opportunity with the same risks as any other investment…what you need to determine is whether or not the risk is worth the potential return of  i must say that the negative reviews on this site seem to be coming from uneducated people who blindly invested or know little about reits andor public exchanges this reit is subject to sec regulation but is done so under relatively new laws pertaining to crowdfunding in other words the sec wanted individuals to be able to invest in opportunities without having to go through institutional investors or brokerage firms this is a good thing for the individual it doesn’t make it a ponzi scheme the sec is in fact regulating this reit which doesn’t eliminate risk but does ensure it is not a “scam” to the point about risk your risk here is that the economy tanks or the commercial real estate market crashes unlikely but more realistic given recent history the value of the properties in the reit would decline your share value would decline and the company may not be able to repurchase your shares if you wanted to “cash out” you have these same exact risks when investing in the stock market if you put  in a dow jones index fund in  and wanted to cash out in  you would only get back  of what you put in and you wouldn’t have received a dividend if you bought citigroup stock in    it was worth less than a dollar in  stock prices even for safe companies go up and down based on nothing but market speculation at least the value of this reit is tied to real property the only added risk of this reit is that the market for share repurchase is completely with the fund they don’t have to buy back your shares but if they don’t their fund would fail last

organization fee that you are charging are way too high for supplying what i consider to be substandard properties in very tertiary markets… once there is another correction in the economy a lot of

authors  sponsors terms wednesday march   investing with richuncles this month i invested with richuncles  rich uncles is the brand name for the nexregen real estate investment trust reit i fund  nexregen runs out of newport beach ca  how i came across the richuncles brand was through facebook believe it or not  i saw their ad and decided to comment  this put me in contact with unclehowie howard makler a cofounder of the company  to make a long story short after doing my due diligence on the company investigating what type of returns id get on my money reading the prospectus includes risks and growth prospects and talking at length with howie i decided to invest  i used my roth ira to invest and put in k  this bought me  shares of this public nonlisted reit why i like the investment and the company first you will earn anywhere from    on your money annual return  you can certainly try to earn more in the stock market butthe stock market is currently overvalued  in learning to live with a stock bubble boston based money manager founder and strategist at gmo jeremy grantham states that stocks are  overpriced  he says that stocks could run up another  but by this point wed be at a true bubble  source barrons magazine march th edition  i dont want to be around in the market when weve reached this point  do you  i hope not  so a  return on my money looks good in comparison to what i could make in an ominous stock market  nexregen reit i is not coupled to the stock market  it is a public but not exchange traded reit second it allows me to diversify my portfolio  i own rental properties equities stocks and nowshares of a nonlisted reit  with the rental properties i own i have to hire a property management company to take care of collecting the rents evicting and attending to the needy tenants  not to mention if something breaks i have to authorize expenses to fix the problem no hot water air conditioning goes down etc  sure these are all tax deductible expenses but not until the end of the year  with nexregen you are in essence a minority owner of multiple commercial real estate properties  yet you are not a landlord  the company takes care of any necessary upkeep for you they collect the rents lease the properties etc  you sit back and collect the quarterly dividends and can reinvest them ie use to purchase more shares as if you owned a rental property but never have the headaches related with being a landlord third as a reit nexregen has to by government regulations disburse  or more of the profits it makes to all investors ie share holders  i expect nexregen a crowd funding entity to continue to grow  i like its growth prospects and im not just saying that because im an investor  right now nexregen is stocked with  properties leased to the del taco franchise in california  the fund because of current regulations that i suspect will end soon thanks to the jobs act is prohibited from doing business with noncalifornia residents  again to me this is an ephemeral situation  soon enough the fund could go national  and thenjust thinkmore investors  more properties  more in profits  more in the form of dividends to shareholders  also i dont think the fund is anywhere near being saturated in california  it is in its infancy within its growth cycle  so investors now are on the ground floor fourth in my estimation the real estate market is on the rise again  it has already experienced its bust in the cycle and as you know this bust was one of epic proportions  really can real estate fall back to those  levels  i think the odds of that are very slim  what does this mean  it means that properties including those held by the nexregen fund will appreciate  when and if the company decides to sell a property the value of the building should be worth more i dont want to assume but i would expect they would only sell in cases where they would turn a profit on the building and the proceeds from this sale must be disbursed to shareholders  im not a commercial real estate expert but if residential properties stand to increase in value i would suspect that the commercial real estate market is right behind fifth ease of entry  the fund only asks that you have a family income combined of k or a net worth of at least k  this opens it up to many many people in california  the minimum investment is only k  i looked at other crowd funding platforms in particular wwwcrowdfundercom  with crowdfundercom you have to be an accredited investor  also you have to select the deal you want to help fund and there is no guarantee that the deal will even fund  you end up waiting for the deal to go through in other words  with rich uncles youll be immediately in their books once you buy the shares benefitting from any upside and with each passing day you are that much closer to getting your dividend disbursement  also you dont have to worry about whether or not you funded the right companydeal with your decision because the current structure is that of the multiple del taco properties ive share three pros and now im going to share the cons first the shares are relatively illiquid  although you can sell your shares a platform to do so would be wwwreitbidcom there is no open market for them unlike shares of publicly traded companies  so if youre buying into the fund most likely you want to accumulate shares via the dividend reinvestment option though you could opt for steady longterm income with a reasonable return  think real estate investor not stock market investor  youre not going to make a trade buy low sell high in less than year  you are committing to being part owner of many commercial real estate properties so you should be in it for the long haul until the fund closes  years from now  i dont think this is that bad of a con but it needs to be stated  when the fund closes that is reaches its cap of investor capital a liquidation event will take place  this is when youll get your value back what your shares are worth at the time plus profits from the proceeds of the sale of all of those buildings  howard makler states its going to be closer to five years  we will look to be at the top of the commercial real estate market when we sell everything to squeeze out the most upside we can for our shareholders new update  the nexregen reit has implemented a share redemption program  in the event of a crisis or emergency whatever you deem to be as the investor you will now have the option of selling back you shares to the company at full value  this is a game changer for me and it adds two things in my mind  reassurance that i can cash out when i need to and  liquidity  i intend on staying invested for the duration but it is good to know that investors could under hardships sell back their shares and attend to their financial needs  this makes this investment now almost bullet proof second youre not going to get a fixed interest rate on your money  unlike a bond that returns  the interest rate from the nexregen reit will be variable   annual rate is a true descriptor of the variability  why isnt a fixed rate  well because with real estate you will have variable expenses each quarter  if nothing goes wrong every building runs smoothly every franchisee pays the rent on time and all is wonderful then yes you should expect a premium return as a shareholder  but alas there are always little things that happen and this hits the gross proceeds top line of the fund  you may be thinking right now that a bond is a better option  it is not  especially not right now   bonds are a terrible investment right now  you have to consider that the fed federal reserve is going to raise rates  rising interest rates mean lower bond prices  sure just consider a k investment in a bond today yielding   say a month from now the fed raises rates and an investor can get the same bond with a  yield  in order to attract more investors the price of the bond you paid k for will need to adjust to  or something like this im not a bond expert so that others will be enticed to buy the bond  bonds have inherent risks as well eg default when the entity you bought the bond from cant meet its obligations  you could get a bond with a shorter maturity  years for example to avoid the pitfall of rising interest rates butthere is no appreciation like real estate and they are overpriced right now  mr grantham states they look absolutely nerverackingly overpriced and in a crisis who knows what will happen to those securities  they could make stocks look like a safe haven if the the next bust occurs at the federal levels of the large countries  bonds including government bonds are a lot more dangerous than people imagine  nexregen is superior to a bond in my view if you can live with the slight variability in the rate of return  update the fund has returned  for  quarters straight now as of august  these are all of the cons i could think of  i fully endorse nexregen reit fund better known as richuncles and cannot wait to begin collecting my steady quarterly dividends like this post  subscribe to this blog for

deleteunknownoctober   at  pmin fairness to your readers the first line of this review should be the notice that you are financially tied to the company and not just as an investor this would give readers a full disclosure right up front instead of reading about it in the comments sectiondeletereplynahom micaeloctober   at  pmthis is a very earnest and pretty wellwritten article by carlos gomez about rich uncles however theres so many red flags about this company that almost as justin ryan alluded to makes it appear that mr gomez is peddling company propaganda or at least has conflicted interest because why write such an extensive concise analysis on a company you have only a menial k invested in i only heard about this company only after their excessively annoying commercials from ladona harvey on am  red flag  ladona knows absolutely nothing about richuncles other than the nebulously generic details as provided in every scam shes only promoting a little more incessantly than mr gomez because of the dinero and its annoying how often she mentions chase bank del taco etc red flag  spoken like every pyramid scheme scam why would such established prominent companies like chase bank need rental propertiesand better yet depend on some obscurely new thirdparty company like richuncles to help lease the properties to them but thats usually what scam artists do is to associate themselves with some prominence or establishment for credibility red flag  another new pretentiouslysounding technical investment that simplifies everything for you does anybody even know how long theyve been around a full entire yearamazing so they do all the work and you sit back and collect the return its so complicated its simple red flag  they are of course illiquid but then mr gomez contradicts himself with their share redemption program which assures liquidity gray area what happens if the program doesnt approve of my financial emergency then am i stuck with the shares in the long haul investments are either liquid or illiquid i dont believe in ambiguous circumstances that will feasibly serve as bothbecause then what obligation would investors in the longer duration and if the share redemption program proved to be correct it wouldnt make the investment almost bullet proof it would indeed make it bullet proof since bonds likewise are not fdicinsured and this whole article spends a great deal detracting people from investing in bonds which i agree with but that doesnt make richuncles a great alternative on that merit alone red flag  the variability on the fixed interest rate is bothersome because there is no minimum fixed rate so in essence it could be anywhere from  to  mr gomez you missed that in your growth prospect the potential to lose your entire investment incurred from those variable expenses sure its highly unrealistic to lose your entire investment but the point is its legally possible for them to come up with a euphemistic memorandum that entails how theyve managed to lose all your money red flag  what is the point of their stringent investment requirements exclusiveness is a more frequent red flag by shady pyramid schemers bernie madoff okay most americans will not be able to invest in this because americans are terrible at building wealth and the median income is only k but is a very risky investor who only inherited an abundant amount of wealth from their ancestors acceptable how about somebody who has excellent credit but only makes kyr with a net worth of k now they of course arent good enough because these arbitrary limits say so replydeleterepliesmfogeymarch   at  pmi want to respond only to nahoms comment why would such established prominent companies like chase bank need rental properties there are very few businesses that own their own real estate in fact many successful businesses who in past generations did like to own their real estate have taken those owned properties and have done whats called a saleleaseback think about it as real estate values have skyrocketed many retail businesses grocery fast food etc have realized they are sitting on lots of builtup equity in the real estate they own for example if you are chase bank why continue to own a property that might be worth  million  psf in rent x  sf x    annually capped value at    million when your core business is lending and holding money for depositors its very unusual for any retailer whether mom and pop or national to own their own real estate the only exception is an owneruser who can get an sba loan lock in their occupancy cost for  years and intends to operate out of one location for a very long time otherwise best to sell the leased asset chase bank  top notch credit  investors will accept a very low return in exchange for security walgreens is another example of a retailer that will command a very low returncap rate because of their high credit so nahom michael sorry to say that you are just flat out wrong with your red flag  im not saying rich uncles is a good or bad investment but i do know that chase bank del taco etc all typically lease space from landlords big and small and if youre wondering if im a commercial real estate professional i am ive been a developer and investor in shopping centers for  yearsdeletereplynahom micaeloctober   at  pmfinally all that being said i personally wouldnt invest in richuncles but they appear to be a fairly lowrisk investment and they are bbbaccredited for now the returns of  sound great in this volatile economy but they are simply uncorroborated numbers the investment is illiquid but also liquid carlos cant make up his mind on that but take comfort in that soon enough the funds could go national just like santa claus could try to fit his fatass down your chimney this christmas its all hypothetical though it does allow you to diversify your portfolio but that would implies there are only limited sources of investing today yes its a real estate investment with little to no maintenance but thats usually how scams operate they do all the work and you just get worked stil i think mr gomez made an earnest knowledgable attempt at promoting richuncles here but why isnt he getting paid instead of ladona or maybe he isreplydeletemaurice bnovember   at  pmnoham thank you for your insights ive heard the radio promos and they are

nontraded reits in general are less volatile than publicly traded reits this is a red herring assertion on many levels for starters if an investor desires less volatility then nontraded reits should be compared to reit index funds index funds are inherently less volatile than individual reits because they are highly diversified for example vanguard’s reit index fund vnq is diversified across  different companies all of which have market caps of at least  million dollars nevertheless for what it’s worth are nontraded reits less volatile than publicly traded reits nontraded reits face the same market forces as public reits renters will pay what the market dictates real estate will be bought and sold for what the market dictates etc a seemingly less volatile share price of a nontraded reit can be illusionary and misleading why let me quote the securities litigation and consulting group the market price of a nontraded reit does not reflect the underlying value of the reits holdings nor the potential for future dividend payments in a free and efficient market an assets price fluctuates with investors expectations for the changes in the assets future value in equity market the share price carries information about investors beliefs about future dividends and value growth including expectations regarding the ability of that firm to sustain its business model the prices of nontraded reits do not reflect this information because they are not openly traded  prices are set at the discretion of management and can be highly misleading as they can be unrelated to the value of the reit or its holdings a more accurate measure of a nontraded reits value would be the net asset value of its holdings httpblogswsjcomtotalreturnthe idea that nontraded reits aren’t volatile is a “misdirection” says joseph harvey of cohen  steers one of the biggest reit investors in the world he says “you can’t measure the volatility of these investments because they do not trade” while they are not exposed to the daytoday volatility of the public markets reit navs are exposed to economic volatility real estate is not immune to economic changes but most importantly what really matters is the end result return on investment when comparing a nontraded reit to its benchmark  not the sp  indexanother problem with reits is that you have the added cost of winding down the whole operation by selling property do your due diligence heres some links pertaining to this review

httpposeidonssrncomdeliverypupdate according to a youtube poster most if not all of the current rich uncles dividend is not coming from rental income he says the latest financial filing i looked at indicated that the reit currently is losing money on an operating cash flow basis which means theyre paying investors with borrowed money or the dividend is really a return of
