cart away in a manger ssaa – nielsen arr matthew b nielsen ssaa with soloists and optional instruments away in a manger ssaa – nielsen one of my favorite musical inventions of the st century is the “mashup”  used mostly in popular music styles the general idea of the technique is to take two or more songs and combine them intertwining their musical themes and rhythmic ideas to create new musical ideas  i enjoy using this pop music technique in my works for the concert hall  in this piece you’ll hear this used mostly in the second verse while the sopranos sing the melody the altos sing an altered version of the hymn “the lord is my shepherd” as a counter melody  meanwhile the accompaniment borrows from “joseph dear oh joseph mine” “the wexford carol” and “mary’s lullaby” combined with the “coventry carol” transition between the first and second verses there are five different songs and carols that will be heard while the piano accompaniment illustrates the musical borrowing the pastoral nature of this setting is best heard when using the instrumental accompaniment the original arrangement is scored for flute oboe guitar and piano the parts are included here with an alternate pianovocal score for when the instruments are being utilized feel free to use any c instrument that works for your choir the guitar is optional but i highly recommend it as it really adds to the

on the first day he came he brought breakfast for himself with a thermos of coffee even though it was his breakfast he was selfless and offered both the bagels and coffee to my wife and daughter after the install of carpet he fixed the strip that connects the hardwood floor to the carpet by gluing it down  a safety hazard  that was not part of the initial job and in my opinion was above and beyond when the second room was installed before he left he noticed the carpet was fluffy lifting near the stairs instead of ignoring the issue he mentioned to my wife the possible tripping hazard and he corrected the issue in my opinion he again went above and beyond not only did he do the above items he did a great job on the install it looks great that is how to keep business great work ethics john
