the market actually rallied then a second wave of concern hit the market amid a liquidity crunch recession worries and ongoing turmoil in the housing subprime mortgage and credit markets large investment banks took major creditrelated writedowns and the highly leveraged structured product market remained somewhat dysfunctional thus november through march proved to be another difficult span for the high yield bond market with spreads widening once again the high yield bank loan sector performed particularly poorly in january and february hit by the combination of growing credit concerns the liquidity crunch and an overhang of supply with driedup demand all of this turmoil culminated in midmarch when the federal reserve board the fed orchestrated a buyout of bear stearns which was on the verge of collapsing by jpmorgan chase the feds actions stabilized the markets somewhat in the last months of the annual period by demonstrating that the fed would do whatever was necessary to quiet fears and prevent systemic failure in april the high yield corporate bond market bounced back somewhat with spreads tightening the high yield corporate bond market exhibited relative stability during may the funds overweight positioning in the health care sector relative to the jp morgan index helped the funds results most as this defensive sector proved to be less volatile than others in

positioning in the homebuilder industry further detracted from results holdings such as hovnanian enterprises and william lyon homes which we continued to hold and standard pacific which we sold by the end of the period each lagged we had shifted to a modestly overweight allocation in homebuilders during the first half of the period seeking to build positions on market weakness given what we believed to be stillattractive longerterm fundamentals however it turned out that we bought a bit prematurely as the housing industry continued to deteriorate during the period prompting us to reduce the funds position in this group to an approximately equal weighting to the jp morgan index by the end of the period also within the homebuilders area we moved into more senior parts of companies capital structures during the second half of the period for example we sold subordinated bonds and senior bonds of hovnanian enterprises and bought senior secured bonds of hovnanian enterprises instead performance from yellow pages publisher rh donnelley was disappointing during the period as pressures on print media grew with the omnipresence of the internet still we maintained the funds sizable position in rh donnelley as we believe the market overreacted and its selloff was overdone a holding in subprime auto lender triad acquisition also detracted from the funds performance as the credit crunch took hold however we believe prospects for a positive outcome in our triad acquisition position remains intact the fund continued to hold a position in this issue changes to the funds portfolio overall we sought to use periods of strength in the high yield corporate bond market such as the rally in april to reduce the funds exposure to lowerrated issues and more cyclical sectors and to increase its position in higherrated securities and more defensive areas of the market more specifically we completely eliminated the funds exposure to the retail sector and reduced its allocation to homebuilders we increased the funds position in energy to a meaningful overweight as this sector tends to be more defensive and was benefiting from soaring oil and gas prices we also increased the funds exposure to cable tv and satellite cable providers we added to the funds holdings in wireline and wireless telecommunications companies as well for example we established a position in the bank debt of alltell just after the close of the funds fiscal year alltell announced that it was going to be acquired by verizon wireless in a  billion deal that will create the biggest mobile phone company in the us we also bought sprint ahead of its downgrade from investment grade status during the period in anticipation of just such a move  riversource high yield bond fund   annual report  pncsrth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th manager commentary continued  we strive to select the right bonds while maintaining a diligent review of potential credit risks at individual companies we added bank loan exposure across certain core holdings in the fund during periods of market weakness as these securities tend to be comparatively defensive in nature over time in many cases this positioned the fund in a more senior part of a companys capital structure thus reducing the overall risk within the portfolio at the end of the period the fund had materially greater exposure than the jp morgan index in the energy health care cable tv wireline telecommunications and wireless telecommunications industries with lesser overweights in the media chemicals and food industries underweights in the funds portfolio included the technology manufacturing and industrial retail and automotive areas the fund also maintained holdings in the gaming and utilities industries each at approximately equal weighting to the jp morgan index our future strategy in our view the high yield corporate bond market may well continue to be challenged over the months ahead as a confluence of factors take hold these factors include a weaker economy slowed consumer spending skyrocketing oil gas and other commodity prices a higher default rate and limited access to capital one of the major questions that faces the market going forward is how the fed will reconcile the need to both fight inflationary pressures and stimulate the economy all told this scenario indicates a difficult environment for the high yield corporate bond market especially if the fed chooses to increase rates as we believe it eventually will given that we are in the latter stages of the economic

sales charges loads on purchase payments and  ongoing costs which may include management fees distribution and service b fees and other fund fees and expenses this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds in addition to the ongoing expenses which the fund bears directly the funds shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests also referred to as acquired funds including affiliated and nonaffiliated pooled investment vehicles including mutual funds and exchange traded funds the funds indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the funds pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds using the acquired funds expense ratio as of the most recent shareholder report the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the

the first line under the heading titled expenses paid during the period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses

the other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds in addition if these transactional costs were

expenses including among other things data prepared by an independent organization showing a comparison of the funds expenses with median expenses paid by funds in its peer group as well as data showing the funds contribution to riversource investments profitability the board accorded particular weight to the notion that the level of fees should reflect a rational pricing model applied

showing comparative profitability over the past two years the board also considered the services acquired by the investment manager through the use of commission dollars paid by the funds on portfolio transactions the board noted that the fees paid by the fund should permit the investment manager to offer competitive compensation to its personnel make necessary investments in its business and earn an appropriate profit the board concluded that profitability levels were reasonable economies of scale to be realized the board also considered the economies of scale that might be realized by riversource investments as the fund grows and took note of the extent to which fund shareholders might also benefit from such growth the board considered that the ims agreement provides for lower fees
