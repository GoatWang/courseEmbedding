to shareholders of crocodile gold feb    et from luxor capital group lp new york feb   prnewswire  luxor capital group lp luxor a usbased investment fund manager has issued the following open letter to shareholders of crocodile gold corp crocodile gold to the shareholders of crocodile gold corp on february   we acquired through a formal takeover bid approximately  of the outstanding common shares of crocodile gold  these acquired shares when added to our existing position prior to the bid leave us controlling approximately  of the issued and outstanding common shares of crocodile gold  i write this letter to address some of the questions our fellow shareholders have asked crocodile golds management with respect to luxors role within the company and our intentions now that luxor together with its affiliates is the controlling shareholder of crocodile gold why did luxor launch a formal takeover bid for crocodile gold shares the combination of our common stock and warrants put our share ownership in crocodile gold at  prior to the tender  with our stock and warrant position at this level we were unable as a practical matter under canadian securities laws to materially increase our position in crocodile gold without making a formal takeover bid to all shareholders  the takeover bid process was not an indictment of existing management or the board of directors rather it was the best available means for us to acquire significantly more shares of crocodile gold why did luxor bid for only  of crocodile gold retaining a listing was and is an important requirement for us  crocodile gold will require additional capital in  and having access to the listed equity markets will help facilitate the raising of that capital should alternate forms of financing not avail themselves  in addition should crocodile gold consider acquisitions in the future a liquid and easilyvalued currency will help enable those acquisitions  finally our ultimate exit envisions a potential refloating of our shares in the public markets at a materially higher share price making retaining the listing an important ongoing requirement for us will luxor seek to take the remaining minority stake private at some point   as mentioned above retaining a listing requirement is critical to us  even if we were so inclined to take the company private and we arent the process of doing so would require at minimum approval by a majority of the minority shareholders ie a majority of nonluxor shareholders would have to agree to this how does luxor view the minority shareholders we view minority shareholders as equal partners with goals identical to our own  maximizing pershare shareholder wealth  as previously mentioned luxors ultimate exit from crocodile gold is most likely a refloating of our shares in the marketplace to effect this strategy it will be critical to ensure the stock price accurately reflects the fair value of the company  the only way to do this is to respect all shareholders maintain openness with the shareholder base and whenever possible align luxors incentives with minority shareholder incentives how will luxor communicate with shareholders going forward most likely we wont  this will probably be our only formal communication with shareholders  we are however asking the company to significantly increase its transparency to shareholders a suggestion warmly embraced by the companys ceo chantal lavoie  we are working with the company on the format for a monthly update to be publicly released to all shareholders on the same day of every month  we hope that good news or bad the increased transparency will allow shareholders to better understand the operations of crocodile gold and at the same time attract new shareholders to our story what is luxors plan for management and the board we are pleased to report that all senior management of crocodile gold have agreed to new contracts with the company including mr lavoie who signed a committed contract for  years on february    crocodile gold is fortunate to be under the leadership of someone with chantals significant experience and strength  we look forward to working with him over the coming years  the board in accordance with the support agreement entered into in connection with the takeover bid will initially be constituted as follows chantal lavoie two independent continuing board members and two appointees designated by luxor  we expect the two appointees to be designated by luxor will be identified by us and appointed by the board by the end of the month what is the ongoing relationship with forbes  manhattan forbes continues to provide back office financial and technical support for crocodile gold  we expect the company will negotiate a transition services agreement with forbes that will allow crocodile gold some time to replicate those services inhouse  forbes also provides us access to technical support and industry knowledge not obtainable otherwise by a company of crocodile golds size     i hope this addressed some of the concerns of current shareholders  we are excited by the prospects of crocodile gold and we hope you are as well i will make myself available to shareholders at the companys next annual meeting but ask that in the meantime shareholders address any questions or comments to the companys investor relations department and not luxor i look forward to working together with the crocodile gold team and hopefully increasing shareholder wealth together with each of you respectfully yours michael conboy luxor capital
