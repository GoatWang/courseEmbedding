company’s future  variety variety continue to variety  skip ad variety editions us global asia subscribe today navigation menu  my account sign in subscribe hometvspotlight tf group ceo gilles pelisson has an ambitious plan for the future martin dale contributor share this article linkedin email print talk francois berthier for variety april    pm pt since taking the reins a little over a year ago tf group chairman and ceo gilles pélisson has implemented an ambitious digital transformation strategy his aim widen the group’s international presence restructuring it as a multichannel content marketplace with reinforced branding and stronger appeal to key audience segments including women and millennials the yearold pélisson whose tf is the recipient of this year’s variety achievement in intl tv award is the nephew of miteducated gerard pélisson cofounder of the accor international hotel chain gilles has assumed key management positions within the accor group including ceo between  and  following his harvard business school mba gilles pélisson worked for six years in the us and then put in seven years as deputy ceo and ceo at euro disney in paris between  and  more recently he advised us investment bank jefferies and is currently a board member of consultancy firm accenture “us business culture has taught me to be curious to discover new things and to be very openminded” he says “i love to test and learn i like the nobulls— attitude and the drive to be efficient” the other key strand of pélisson’s career is his longterm professional relationship with martin bouygues ceo of the bouygues group tf group’s biggest shareholder dating back to his time as cco and ceo of bouygues telecom between  and  “there’s a lot of trust” pélisson says “that’s important to chart a medium to longterm strategy” pélisson is only the third ceo of the tf group since it was privatized in  he was a nonexecutive board member at the group from  onward and his immediate predecessor nonce paolini worked as his deputy at bouygues telecom the tf group is europe’s leading private broadcasting group with a combined audience share of  in  for its five freetoair channels and a  point lead between tf and its nearest rival m when pélisson was appointed ceo in february  the group faced important challenges including the need to improve its current operating margin which at  was lower than commercial rivals such as m in  the group’s results have been undermined by audience fragmentation caused by the launch of digital terrestrial television in  that forced the group to acquire four freetoair channels and launch digital initiatives including replay tv and vod platform mytf gilles pélisson is the third ceo of tf group since the network was privatized in  and has been on the job since feb  francois berthier for variety pélisson aims to improve the group’s operating margin by a mixture of cost savings and revenue increases in particular through better monetization of advertising launch of digital services and reinforced content production he believes that monetization can be improved by delivering a more targeted service to advertisers in part through building a clearer brand identity for each channel “the key idea since i joined tf as chairman is how can we make the most of the fact that we’re a multichannel group with tf as our flagship channel you can develop personality for each channel and each brand by nourishing them with strong animators unique content and regular daily slots that viewers can relate to” “our flagship channel tf is our key reference” says ara aprikian executive vp for content “we want to maintain its power it’s an unusual phenomenon in europe given its high ratings and the distance between it and its nearest commercial competitor m but we need to adapt its economic approach especially in terms of scheduling” clearer targets have been set for the group’s other freetoair channels tmc which focuses on entertainment and lc for news both targeted at  to yearolds hd for drama targeted at women ages  and nt targeted at millennials ages  these new positionings have helped boost the channels’ ratings by  in the fourth quarter of  pélisson also aims to capitalize on peak viewing figures for tf’s news bulletins at  and  pm by scheduling shorter programs near these slots with commercial breaks this includes a preview slot of tmc’s popular chat show “quotidien” hosted by yann barthes and daily editions of game show “the wall” which bowed in march “we have reinforced our credibility with advertisers and rights holders” aprikian says “they understand that we have a new fastmoving strategy and a modern approach we’re willing to take risks and have shown we’re open to new partnerships” the group also aims to maximize synergies between channels including potential cost savings in areas such as news production and rotation of content across channels “if we ran a miniseries on tf which generated an audience of  million to  million we can play the same episodes on the next night on our channel hd with an additional audience of around ” says pélisson cable tv is another priority “one of our ideas is that carriage fees are not currently paid by cable operators in france to freetoair channels contrary to most of the world” he says “we have introduced this as a new area of discussion we want to change our business model introducing new services for viewers” pélisson says that his overall goal is to be the no  content marketplace in france which will enable brands to extend their reach beyond tv screens this motivated the acquisition of one of france’s most successful socialmedia outlets minutebuzz in late  and a partnership with german broadcaster prosieben in the multichannel network studio  also involving italy’s mediaset “we’ve taken a small stake worldwide in studio  which is very strong in germany europe and america with strong ties in hollywood” says pélisson several group shows such as tmc’s “quotidien” and reality series such as “secret story” and “la villa des coeurs brisés” have built strong internet communities especially among younger women and teenagers “it’s very important that we cover the entire audience spectrum and appeal to millennials” says pélisson in addition to improving tf’s monetization and digital presence the other key pillar of pélisson’s strategy is to increase the group’s content creation capacity in france and abroad “at disney i learned the importance of the brand of never forgetting the ‘wow effect’ and the critical importance of protecting a brand of knowing whether you have characters and intellectual property that you can exploit” pélisson says “france is one of the few countries where although broadcasters are obliged to invest in ip we don’t own it at the end this can be highly frustrating so one of our core ideas is to become a major producer of ip” film production has been streamlined under the new unit tf studio launched in the second half of  a second unit tf entertainment oversees activities in music live shows licenses gamestoys and collections in terms of music publishing the group has contracted artists such as popular french singer and songwriter matt pokora and acquired a minority stake in play two a new independent music producer the group will soon open an ambitious music venue la seine musical integrated within the hautsdeseine valley of culture project another key pillar of the content creation strategy is the acquisition of  of french production group newen responsible for netflix’s first french series “marseille” and canal plus’ englishlanguage hit “versailles” this acquisition played a key role in the  boost in revenues from the group’s studios and entertainment activities in its  consolidated results “newen is definitely a new leg in terms of our business operations” pélisson says “we want to be a player in terms of content production and build up smaller acquisitions to give us a european dimension which started with the acquisition of dutch producer tuvalu and opening an office in london” tf’s acquisition of newen nonetheless sent shockwaves through the french media industry that was potentially destabilizing for newen — since it generates less than  of its turnover from the tf group both tf and newen are keen to emphasize their commitment to maintaining strictly independent operations “one of the things i learned at disney was that if you want to retain strong creative people you have to make sure that they can think freely and have enough autonomy that they can really express themselves and that the sky’s the limit” says pélisson “we want to capitalize on newen’s track record and relationships we really want to protect that independence and not affiliate them too strongly with tf” the “trinity agreement” — a coproduction pact signed among tf nbcuniversal and rtl germany — whose first project is the procedural drama “gone” further reinforces the group’s content creation strategy pélisson highlights the importance of tf’s long relationship with the key hollywood studios and says that one of the first things he did as ceo was to go to la for meetings he plans to return in may “our game plan in terms of programming is to mix us content and european and french content” pélisson says citing the example of tf’s deal with netflix when the latter launched “marseille” tf broadcast the first two episodes on primetime as part of a deal to broadcast all of season one in advance of the season two return “we want to make the tf group more international” says pélisson “that’s the driving force behind our support for newen’s european expansion and the reason why we have invested in studio  we want to be associated with the best in the class “the us studios are key for us both the established studios and new players like netflix and amazon we think that working with them helps us build value we aim to be at the crossroads of all these possibilities” filed under gilles pélissontf want to read more articles like this one subscribe to variety today post a comment  biz scaramucci blasts
