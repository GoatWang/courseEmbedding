march   in spartanburg south carolina on december   he won a grand national series race at speedway park in jacksonville florida becoming the first black driver to win a race at nascars premier level scotts career was repeatedly affected by racial prejudice and problems with toplevel nascar officials however his determined struggle as an underdog won him thousands of white fans and many friends and admirers among his fellow racers he was posthumously inducted into the nascar hall of fame in  contents  background  racing career  legacy  references  external links backgroundedit scott was born in danville virginia from boyhood he wanted to be his own boss in danville two industries dominated the local economy cotton mills and tobaccoprocessing plants scott vowed to avoid that sort of bossdominated life that mills too much like a prison he told a friend you go in and they lock a gate behind you and you cant get out until youve done your time this quotation and those that follow are from hard driving and are posted here by the books author he began learning auto mechanics from his father who worked as a driver and mechanic for two welltodo white families scott and his sister guelda were awed by their fathers daring behind the wheel he frightened people to death guelda said they say hed come through town just about touching the ground after scott started racing all the old people would say the same thing hes just like his daddy scott raced bicycles against white boys in his neighborhood he said i was the only black boy that had a bicycle he became a daredevil on roller skates speeding down danvilles steep hills on one skate he dropped out of high school became a taxi driver married mary coles and served in the segregated army in europe during world war ii after the war he ran an autorepair shop as a sideline he took up the dangerous illegal pursuit of running moonshine whiskey this trade gave quite a few early stock car racers such as junior johnson and big bill france their education in building fast cars and outrunning the police the police caught scott only once in  sentenced to three years probation he continued making his latenight whiskey runs on weekends he would go to the stock car races in danville racing careeredit scott was around thirty years old when he was sitting in the bleachers of local speedways watching white men race up to then he had lived his whole life under rules of segregation the danville races were run by the dixie circuit one of several regional racing organizations that competed with nascar during that era danvilles events always made less money than the dixie circuits races at other tracks we were a tobacco and textile town  people didnt have the money to spend said aubrey ferrell one of the organizers the officials decided they would try an unusual and unprecedented promotional gimmick they would recruit a negro driver the next day however brought the first of many episodes of discrimination that would plague his racing career scott repaired his car and towed it to a nascarsanctioned race in winstonsalem north carolina but the nascar officials refused to let him compete black drivers were not allowed they said as he drove home scott recalled i had tears in my eyes a few days later he went to another nascar event in high point north carolina again scott said the officials just flat told me i couldnt race they told me i could let a white boy drive my car i told em werent no damn white boy going to drive my car scott decided to avoid nascar for the time being and race with the dixie circuit and at other nonnascar speedways he won his first race at lynchburg virginia only twelve days into his racing career it was just a short heat race in the amateur class but for scott the victory was like a barb on a hook he knew that he had found his calling he ran as many as five events a week mostly at virginia tracks some spectators would shout racial slurs but many others began rooting for him some prejudiced drivers would wreck him deliberately they just hammered on wendell former chief nascar photographer t taylor warren said they figured he wasnt going to retaliate and they were right—scott felt that because of the racial atmosphere he could not risk becoming involved in the fistfights and dirtydriving paybacks that frequently took place among the white driverscitation needed many other drivers however came to respect scott they saw his skills as a mechanic and driver and they liked his quiet uncomplaining manner they saw him as someone similar to themselves another hardworking bluecollar guy swept up in the adrenaline rush of racing not somebody trying to make a racial point he was a racer  you could look at somebody and tell whether they were a racer or not said driver rodney ligon who was also a moonshine runner didnt nobody send him to the track to represent his race  he come down because he wanted to drive a damn racecar some white drivers became his close friends and also occasionally acted as his bodyguards some southern newspapers began writing positive stories about scotts performance he began the  season on the northern virginia circuit for example by winning a feature race in staunton then he tied the waynesboro qualifying record a week later he won the waynesboro feature after placing first in his heat race and setting a new qualifying record the waynesboro news virginian reported that scott had become recognized as one of the most popular drivers to appear here the staunton news leader said he has been among the top drivers in every race here scott understood though that to rise in the sport he somehow had to gain admission to the allwhite ranks of nascar he did not know nascars celebrated founder and president bill france who ran the organization like a czar instead scott found a way essentially to slip into nascar through a side door without the knowledge or consent of anyone at nascars daytona beach headquarters he towed his racecar to a local nascar event at the old richmond speedway a quartermile dirt oval and asked the steward mike poston to grant him a nascar license poston a parttimer was not a powerful figure in nascars hierarchy but he did have the authority to issue licenses he asked scott if he knew what he was getting into i told him weve never had any black drivers and youre going to be knocked around poston said he said i can take it poston approved scotts license later he confided to scott that officials at nascar headquarters had not been pleased with his decision he told me that when they found out at daytona beach that he had signed me up they raised hell with him scott said scott met bill france for the first time in april  the night before scott said the promoter at a nascar event in raleigh north carolina had given gas money to all of the white drivers who came to the track but refused to pay scott anything scott said he approached france in the pits at the lynchburg speedway and told him what had happened even though france and the raleigh promoter were friends scott said france immediately pulled some money out of his pocket and assured scott that nascar would never treat him with prejudice he let me know my color didnt have anything to do with anything scott said he said youre a nascar member and as of now you will always be treated as a nascar member and instead of giving me fifteen dollars he reached in his pocket and gave me thirty dollars scott won dozens of races during his nine years in regionallevel competition his driving talent his skill as a mechanic and his hard work earned him the admiration of thousands of white fans and many of his fellow racers despite the racial prejudice that was widespread during the s in  he won two championships nascar awarded him the championship title for drivers of sportsmanclass stock cars in the state of virginia and he also won the track championship in the sportsman class at richmonds southside speedway even at this early stage of his racing scott would tell friends privately that his goal was to win races at the top level of nascar for the rest of his career he would pursue a dream whose fulfillment depended heavily upon whether france backed up that promisecitation needed in  he moved up to the grand national division now known as the monster energy nascar cup series in the  season he finished th in points and on december  of that year driving a chevrolet bel air that he purchased from ned jarrett he won a race on the halfmile dirt track at speedway park in jacksonville florida—the first and to date only grand national event won by an africanamerican darrell wallace jr recently became the second africanamerican driver in nascars top  series to win with his  kroger  win at martinsville scott passed richard petty who was driving an ailing car with  laps remaining for the win scott was not announced as the winner of the race at the time presumably due to the racist culture of the time buck baker the secondplace driver was initially declared the winner but race officials discovered two hours later that scott had not only won but was two laps in front of the rest of the field nascar awarded scott the win two years later but his family never actually received the trophy he had earned until – years after the race and  years after scott had died he continued to be a competitive driver despite his lowbudget operation through the rest of the s in  scott finished th in points despite missing several races over the next five years scott consistently finished in the top ten in the point standings he finished th in points in  was a careerhigh th in  th in  and finished th in both  and  his top year in winnings was  when he won  scott was forced to retire due to injuries from a racing accident at talladega alabama in  he achieved one win and  top ten finishes in  career grand national starts scott died on december   in danville virginia having suffered from spinal cancer legacyedit a  chevrolet built by scott for the movie greased lightning on display at the nascar hall of fame the film greased lightning starring richard

into his racing career it was just a short heat race in the amateur class but for scott the victory was like a barb on a hook he knew that he had found his calling he ran as many as five events a week mostly at virginia tracks some spectators would shout racial slurs but many others began rooting for him some prejudiced drivers would wreck him deliberately they just hammered on wendell former chief

admission to the allwhite ranks of nascar he did not know nascars celebrated founder and president bill france who ran the organization like a czar instead scott found a way essentially to slip into nascar through a side door without the knowledge or consent of anyone at nascars daytona beach headquarters he towed his racecar to a local nascar event at the old richmond speedway a quartermile dirt oval and asked the steward mike poston to grant him a nascar license poston a parttimer was not a powerful figure in nascars hierarchy but he did have the authority to issue licenses he asked scott if he knew what he was getting into i told him weve never had any black drivers and youre going to be knocked around poston said he said i can take it poston approved scotts license later he confided to

this quotation and those that follow are from hard driving and are posted here by the books author he began learning auto mechanics from his father who worked as a driver and mechanic for two welltodo white families scott and his sister guelda were awed by their fathers daring behind the wheel he frightened people to death guelda said they say hed come through town just about touching the ground after scott started racing all the old people would say the same thing hes just like his daddy scott raced bicycles against white boys in his neighborhood he said i was the only black boy that had a bicycle he became a daredevil on roller skates speeding down danvilles steep hills on one skate he dropped out of high school became a taxi driver married mary coles and served in the segregated army in europe during world war ii after the war he ran an autorepair shop as a sideline he took up the dangerous illegal pursuit of running moonshine whiskey this trade gave quite a few early stock car racers such as junior johnson and big bill france their education in building fast cars and outrunning the police the police caught scott only once in  sentenced to three years probation he continued making his latenight whiskey runs on weekends he would go to the stock car races in danville racing careeredit scott was around thirty years old when he was sitting in the bleachers of local speedways watching white men race up to then he had lived his whole life under rules of segregation the danville races were run by the dixie circuit one of several regional racing organizations that competed with nascar during that era danvilles events always made less money than the dixie circuits races at other tracks we were a tobacco and textile town  people didnt have the money to spend said aubrey ferrell one of the organizers the officials decided they would try an unusual and unprecedented promotional gimmick they would recruit a negro driver the next day however brought the first of many episodes of discrimination that would plague his racing career scott repaired his car and towed it to a nascarsanctioned race in winstonsalem north carolina but the nascar officials refused to let him compete black drivers were not allowed they said as he drove home scott recalled i had tears in my eyes a few days later he went to another nascar event in high point north carolina again scott said the officials just flat told me i couldnt race they told me i could let a white boy drive my car i told em werent no damn white boy going to drive my car scott decided to avoid nascar for the time being and race with the dixie circuit and at other nonnascar speedways he won his first race at lynchburg virginia only twelve days into his racing career it was just a short heat race in the amateur class but for scott the victory was like a barb on a hook he knew that he had found his calling he ran as many as five events a week mostly at virginia tracks some spectators would shout racial slurs but many others began rooting for him some prejudiced drivers would wreck him deliberately they just hammered on wendell former chief nascar photographer t taylor warren said they figured he wasnt going to retaliate and they were right—scott felt that because of the racial atmosphere he could not risk becoming involved in the fistfights and dirtydriving paybacks that frequently took place among the white driverscitation needed many other drivers however came to respect scott they saw his skills as a mechanic and driver and they liked his quiet uncomplaining manner they saw him as someone similar to themselves another hardworking bluecollar guy swept up in the adrenaline rush of racing not somebody trying to make a racial point he was a racer  you could look at somebody and tell whether they were a racer or not said driver rodney ligon who was also a moonshine runner didnt nobody send him to the track to represent his race  he come down because he wanted to drive a damn racecar some white drivers became his close friends and also occasionally acted as his bodyguards some southern newspapers began writing positive stories about scotts performance he began the  season on the northern virginia circuit for example by winning a feature race in staunton then he tied the waynesboro qualifying record a week later he won the waynesboro feature after placing first in his heat race and setting a new qualifying record the waynesboro news virginian reported that scott had become recognized as one of the most popular drivers to appear here the staunton news leader said he has been among the top drivers in every race here scott understood though that to rise in the sport he somehow had to gain admission to the allwhite ranks of nascar he did not know nascars celebrated founder and president bill france who ran the organization like a czar instead scott found a way essentially to slip into nascar through a side door without the knowledge or consent of anyone at nascars daytona beach headquarters he towed his racecar to a local nascar event at the old richmond speedway a quartermile dirt oval and asked the steward mike poston to grant him a nascar license poston a parttimer was not a powerful figure in nascars hierarchy but he did have the authority to issue licenses he asked scott if he knew what he was getting into i told him weve never had any black drivers and youre going to be knocked around poston said he said i can take it poston approved scotts license later he confided to scott that officials at nascar headquarters had not been pleased with his decision he told me that when they found out at daytona beach that he had signed me up they raised hell with him scott said scott met bill france for the first time in april  the night before scott said the promoter at a nascar event in raleigh north carolina had given gas money to all of the white drivers who came to the track but refused to pay scott anything scott said he approached france in the pits at the lynchburg speedway and told him what had happened even though france and the raleigh promoter were friends scott said france immediately pulled some money out of his pocket and assured scott that nascar would never treat him with prejudice he let me know my color didnt have anything to do with anything scott said he said youre a nascar member and as of now you will always be treated as a nascar member and instead of giving me fifteen dollars he reached in his pocket and gave me thirty dollars scott won dozens of races during his nine years in regionallevel competition his driving talent his skill as a mechanic and his hard work earned him the admiration of thousands of white fans and many of his fellow racers despite the racial prejudice that was widespread during the s in  he won two championships nascar awarded him the championship title for drivers of sportsmanclass stock cars in the state of virginia and he also won the track championship in the sportsman class at richmonds southside speedway even at this early stage of his racing scott would tell friends privately that his goal was to win races at the top level of nascar for the rest of his career he would pursue a dream whose fulfillment depended heavily upon whether france backed up that promisecitation needed in  he moved up to the grand national division now known as the monster energy nascar cup series in the  season he finished th in points and on december  of that year driving a chevrolet bel air that he purchased from ned jarrett he won a race on the halfmile dirt

top  series to win with his  kroger  win at martinsville scott passed richard petty who was driving an ailing car with  laps remaining for the win scott was not announced as the winner of the race at
