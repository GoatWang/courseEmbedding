in the age of need it now• iot is happening now are you prepared• visas richey on card fraud fraud summit keynoter offers advice on stronger security tracy kitten fraudblogger • april        minutes    twitter facebook linkedin credit eligible get permission ellen richey ellen richey chief legal officer and enterprise risk officer at visa says card issuers retailers payments processors and others handling card data must go beyond pci compliance if they expect to effectively fight fraud there are already best practices out there that go beyond the technical side of pci richey says in an interview with information security media group transcript below those best practices include guidelines and recommendations related to the need for wider adoption of chip cards such as those that conform to the europay mastercard visa standard tokenization and endtoend encryption another important fraudprevention step richey says is limiting the storage of card data today upwards of  percent of our retailers have certified that they no longer store that data  information that is not essential to processing a payment or transaction she says for card data that processors must store tokenization should be applied she stresses to make card numbers inaccessible during this interview richey also discusses the role enhanced analytics is playing in fraud detection how visa is working with other card brands to spur adoption of emv in the us and why tokenization is so critical for the security of ecommerce cardnotpresent transactions richey oversees visas compliance audit and risk teams including payment system risk settlement risk and enterprise risk she also serves as the companys primary legal adviser before joining visa in  she worked at washington mutual inc as senior vice president of enterprise risk management and executive vice president of card services earlier in her career she served as vice chairman of providian financial corp where she led the enterprise risk management legal corporate governance corporate relations compliance and audit functions richey also was a partner in the san francisco law firm farella braun  martel where she specialized in corporate real estate and financial institution matters limiting access to data tracy kitten explain how limiting the amount of data merchants access is expected to reduce fraud ellen richey first we need to ensure that no one is storing anything they dont need the good news on that front is that weve made tremendous progress since the early days of data compromises in the payments industry now upwards of  percent of our retailers have certified that they no longer store unnecessary data so thats one big step forward weve already accomplished the next step and something that is already in progress is to devalue the data that passes through their systems so even if theyre not storing it they are vulnerable to attack as the data moves through their system we have multiple ways of devaluing the data one of which is our primary focus right now in  which is rolling out with emv chip ongoing storage of data kitten why is this ongoing storage of card data such a problem for the industry richey as i mentioned it really isnt storage in the retail environment anymore we have made huge strides in that regard of course youve got some parts of the payments industry that still have to maintain the data and in recent years weve seen attacks for example on processors so the answer there is that we will have one segment of the industry where the data is devalued so that it is no longer targeted by thieves but we will have to have even stronger security than we have today because there is always going to be the need for storage somewhere beyond pci compliance kitten could visa mandate that the industry go beyond pci compliance richey there are already best practices out there particularly on the processing side that weve published and are available on our website to go beyond the technical side of pci also to do more along the resilience side of data security such as improved or more frequent vulnerability monitoring and intrusion detection today in data security you need to be getting away from strictly building a fortress to protect data and pay more attention to what you do in case hackers should be in your environment then the second big item is to restrict the utility of the data in the hands of the retail industry by that i mean if we can make the data less valuable to criminals by using dynamic data that cant be reused to commit fraud we can actually take the retailers out of harms way and of course one of the examples there is the emv chip another example would be our initiative around tokenization which would devalue data in large portions of the industry additional security layers kitten what additional security layers is visa pushing richey the big three in our mind right now are the chip tokenization and pointtopoint encryption which is a valuable tool available right now for retailers to protect themselves from the moment data is entered at the pointofsale in addition to that were always looking at the next generation of predictive analytics for fraud control were also improving our response technologies the way we identify when breaches have occurred and get that intelligence out into the industry securing pos networks kitten what role do you see the card brands playing in merchant security richey we have a rather elaborate program called the cardholder information security program information about that is available on visacom we also as part of that program ask that our acquiring banks provide a validation of pci compliance throughout the industry based on the size of the merchant for example they may provide a thirdparty independent validation a selfassessment and so forth that is one big area where weve been involved for quite a few years and of course we are moving beyond enforcement toward incentives such as our liability shift for emv regulatory oversight kitten do you ever foresee there being regulatory oversight over retailers richey that is hard for me to say at the congressional hearing where i testified certainly ftc federal trade commission chairwoman edith ramirez was taking a strong position that additional oversight is needed however they just dont have that system of strict supervision outside the banking industry that they do within it so i would be doubtful that youll see the same level of regulatory oversight as you see in the banking industry adoption of emv kitten can you talk about some of the steps that are being taken to help retailers enhance their adoption of emv richey weve certainly been working for some years to make sure that the standards are really implementable here in the united states and tailored to our market one of the more recent initiatives there is to make sure weve licensed the technology to ensure all the merchants can route their transactions as is required by the doddfrank act that has been resolved really with some of the major processors like first data for example in recent months that is one big effort that is coming to a conclusion in addition visa and mastercard recently formed a crossindustry working group that will meet to accelerate emv adoption by working together collaboratively we also across all the brands provide services on behalf of smaller institutions that might not want to make the investment themselves we can actually do that for them kitten what are some of emvs security limitations richey the great thing about emv is it will eliminate if its fully deployed counterfeit fraud but counterfeit fraud is only one type of fraud and probably the biggest gap if one did not pursue tokenization would be cardnotpresent fraud in todays world that means ecommerce fraud that is why we are so interested in pushing forward with our tokenization initiative payment infrastructure changes kitten could you talk about some of the changes you see coming in  from a payments infrastructure and technology perspective richey i think we may have covered most of them but the biggest item were looking toward is the uptake in emv cards i think youll start seeing them come into the market as the cards are routinely reissued through the course of business secondly of course is our tokenization initiative you will start to see actual tokenization service providers coming on later this year perhaps as early as late summer or fall and that will be an interesting change for the industry we also see quite a bit of adoption of riskbased verified by visa services which are based on not only behavioral data analytics but also information that can be gained from the computer or device that is used to make the transactions so were seeing quite a bit of uptake there on our visa consumer authentication services and others like it antifraud cybersecurity
