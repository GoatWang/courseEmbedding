fmsbond  or email us state of munis if corporate tax rates were cut  if corporate tax rates were reduced to say  do you think the municipal bond market would be ok in terms of demand why did fed rates rise and muni rates ease  after the fed raised the benchmark lending rate by  last week why are municipal bond rates off  across all maturities and credit ratings an opportunity during muni redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir ratings are uselesswhy should i trust them now how can puerto rico bonds have aa rating  regarding your article bondholders after puerto rico’s bankruptcy filing i noticed you are still selling puerto rico bonds with an aa listingis there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones i ownhow do they get such a great rating determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond  in your recent article muni investors succeed by defying the odds you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first then yield how should i base my determination of quality ratings if so which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear maturity we live in ca for which she paid over  the whole portfolio is like that please explain why she shouldnt buy premium bonds she wont listen to me or call me crazy and tell me its ok to rack up  in premiums in this portfolio     next › last » looking for specific bondsdo you have specific criteria for bonds youre looking for let us know and well email you bonds that fit your needs there is no

broader implications for black folk not only in cuba but within the us we met with alphonso casanova the deputy minister of economic planning and the chief architect of cuba’s economic transformation

fmsbond  or email us state of munis if corporate tax rates were cut  if corporate tax rates were reduced to say  do you think the municipal bond market would be ok in terms of demand why did fed rates rise and muni rates ease  after the fed raised the benchmark lending rate by  last week why are municipal bond rates off  across all maturities and credit ratings an opportunity during muni redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir ratings are uselesswhy should i trust them now how can puerto rico bonds have aa rating  regarding your article bondholders after puerto rico’s bankruptcy filing i noticed you are still selling puerto rico bonds with an aa listingis there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones i ownhow do they get such a great rating determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond  in your recent article muni investors succeed by defying the odds you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first then yield how should i base my determination of quality ratings if so which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear maturity we live in ca for which she paid over  the whole portfolio is like that please explain why she shouldnt buy premium bonds she wont listen to me or call me crazy and tell me its ok to rack up  in premiums in this portfolio     next › last » looking for specific bondsdo you have specific criteria for bonds youre looking for let us know and well email you bonds that fit your needs there is no
