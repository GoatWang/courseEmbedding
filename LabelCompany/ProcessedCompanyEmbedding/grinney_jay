 pm posted on november   at  am  gallery jay grinney by kelly poe kpoealcom by  jay grinney had gotten used to constantly putting out fires at healthsouth the depths of the problem with healthsouths corporate office were far greater than he had anticipated thats the nature of accounting fraud its difficult to know which numbers to trust and which numbers are fabricated todays healthsouth is largely unrecognizable from its past grinney is only the companys second ceo and he announced last month that at  he will retire at the end of this year the company has returned to normal  a feat that when grinney entered the picture very few thought was possible grinney had left his job at competing hospital corporation of america in nashville in  he was president of the healthcare companys eastern group managing some  hospitals he knew of healthsouths problems in  the companys founder and ceo richard scrushy had been fired after regulators had charged him with sweeping accounting fraud healthsouth was among the largest publicly traded healthcare companies in the country at the time and while working for a direct competitor he saw that healthsouths hospitals were really very good so he saw the company as fixable the problems were isolated to the corporate headquarters there was a product worth saving but upon starting work at healthsouth grinney learned that the problems at the headquarters ran far beyond fraud  the company that had grown largely through acquisitions had never been streamlined into a company that could run well and it largely lacked any disciplinary controls he was living in temporary housing in inverness and was working so much he rarely saw any part of birmingham that wasnt in that threemile stretch of us  he was having problems with his thenwife  the pair divorced in  in  he was diagnosed with cancer a herculean task the cancer isnt what grinney remembers most about  in fact he recalls only missing maybe two days of work as a result of it he had surgery to remove the tumor and was advised to do radiation and possibly chemotherapy he chose instead to only get the surgery and rigorously monitor for resurgences which never came it never really occurred to me that it would be worse than that grinney said there was a lot going on and i didnt really have time to think about it i guess healthsouth was still in crisis and he didnt have the energy to spare for chemotherapy that same year grinney had just achieved what he had called a herculean task  healthsouth had fixed problems discovered as a result of the sarbanesoxley act of  a federal act designed to prevent accounting fraud passed largely in response to recent accounting scandals at companies like enron and worldcom the law required publicly traded companies to do assessments of internal controls and look for any weaknesses the most severe of which was called a material weakness grinney expected to find several such weaknesses at healthsouth in  especially within the accounting department grinney did not expect to find several dozen material weaknesses many of which were completely unrelated to fraud most companies only had two or three of these weakness many had none at all we had more material weaknesses than any other company i had heard of grinney said we had dozens and dozens fixing those weaknesses went largely unnoticed by shareholders at the time grinney said in some ways that makes sense  healthsouth was dealing with many higher profile issues like paying down the  billion in debt most of that debt was taken out under scrushy to pay for expansions and federal prosecutors said those expansions were really a ruse to hide accounting fraud grinney lists fixing those material weaknesses as among his proudest achievements in his  years as ceo it was earlier this year that grinney was told he no longer had to have his annual evaluations to see if the cancer has returned hes as in the clear as one can be as a cancer survivor declining to declare if you ask grinney what hes proudest of in his year tenure at healthsouth hell tell you its the team he put together birmingham attorney john somerville represented healthsouth shareholders in a derivative suit and won a  billion judgment against scrushy on behalf of the company somerville worked closely with grinney in that suit and hell tell you grinney leaves behind a legacy far greater than just his staff the survival of healthsouth is jay grinneys legacy somerville said somerville also represented sterne agees former chief financial officer in an unrelated lawsuit against the financial company and its ceo james holbrook jr alleging fraud breach of contract conversion and defamation somervilles client was fired in  for what sterne agee called accounting mistakes while his client holds that it was because he attempted to stop holbrooks fraud in  it was reported that the us department of the treasury was investigating holbrook for fraud sterne agee which was headquartered in birmingham and was one of the nations largest and oldest privatelyowned financial services companies outside wall street announced in early  it would be sold to stifel a st louisbased company and that provides a perfect example of what could have happened to healthsouth somerville said frequently whats best for the company and the employees and whats best for the shareholders may be the hardest route an easy way out would have been to declare bankruptcy or to sell at some discounted price honestly in my opinion we have an example of that very recently with sterne agee somerville said the healthsouth board of directors to its credit picked someone who was equal to the task of taking the hard way for the benefits of the employees the shareholders and the community  for that we owe a debt of gratitude to jay grinney he did it and he defied the odds what happened at healthsouth was not an isolated incident it followed the enron scandal of  where shareholders lost  billion thousands of employees lost their retirement funds and the company filed for bankruptcy then in  it came out that worldcom had inflated its assets by  billion leading it to file what was at the time the largest bankruptcy in the countrys history healthsouths story had a lot in common with these predecessors the main difference being that it survived protective lifes ceo johnny johns said he expected healthsouth to declare bankruptcy in the early s and that largely everyone in the birmingham community did if it had declared bankruptcy birmingham would have moved on just as houston did after enron but it would have remained a black spot on the citys reputation another larry langford cautionary tale instead healthsouth is today a pride of birmingham said johns who is a close personal friend of grinneys falling for birmingham you can imagine a birmingham without healthsouth you can imagine the jobs that arent there the ghosts would inhabit the squarefoot headquarters scrushy built off of us  but its hard to account for all the small ways having a publicly traded company affects the community said ralph smith a birmingham attorney who taught a class at the university of alabama school of law on the accounting scandals of the early s including healthsouth having a corporate headquarters of a successful company is an important ingredient in the success of a community you have corporate citizenship opportunities when you have a regions headquartered here or a protective life insurance headquartered here even though protective is now owned in japan their us operations are headquartered right here and theyre an important part of the corporate culture smith said birmingham has benefited from great corporate leadership and also from time to time has suffered from the absentee ownership syndrome im just so pleased that healthsouth has remained remained strong and continues to grow grinney shaped more than just healthsouth he serves on the boards of major birmingham companies like cocacola bottling company united and energen corp and has served in the past on the board for staples like the birmingham civil rights institute he was active in forming blueprint birmingham the birmingham business alliances comprehensive economic development plan today healthsouth is one of only three fortune  companies that remain in the state along with regions financial corp and vulcan materials after scrushy was fired there was doubt about whether healthsouth would survive but even when it became clear that healthsouth would survive the scandal many worried the company could still leave birmingham  including johns grinney said healthsouth never seriously entertained the idea of leaving birmingham but plenty outside of the community wanted it to executives and economic development agencies courted grinney to encourage him to move healthsouths corporate headquarters to charlotte richmond and especially nashville he said there certainly was a fullcourt press applied to me by the people in the nashville business community and the nashville chamber of commerce grinney said youre in a crisis mode and theres something to be said about new beginnings my thought on the other hand was because we were in a crisis to ask so many people to relocate would be an undue and unnecessary burden to place on people you were depending on to get help get the company turned around johns anxiety wasnt unfounded to raise money to pay down its massive debt healthsouth sold surgical care affiliates in  for 9 million that companys corporate headquarters is now in illinois johns anxieties were eased in 9 when grinney married melanie parker a birmingham native parker had travelled around the world to places like new york london and paris before returning home where she worked for a while as the director of marketing for the birmingham museum of art johns knew when they married grinney wasnt going anywhere the couple now lives in mountain brook i started to really enjoy being here and fell in love with the city grinney said it wasnt soon thereafter that i concluded i would never want to relocate the corporate office healthsouth all grown up by  the company had completed its turnaround it had settled all the outstanding litigation and paid all of its settlements thats when we really started thinking about what we wanted to be when we grew up grinney said the company began an aggressive growth strategy that led to more than  acquisitions including the massive  million purchase of reliant hospital partners and the  million purchase of georgias caresouth on monday healthsouth broke ground on its new corporate headquarters on  acres of land in liberty park the lease on the current building ends in  healthsouth used to own the corporate campus but sold it for  million in  to help pay down the debt grinney has said in the past the lease ending provided healthsouth with the opportunity to move into a building that better suited with what the company is now open and collaborative the old building he has said was overbuilt with a layout created to keep departments from interacting with one another the new space he said will be open with natural sunlight hitting the offices it will have common areas the current campus lacks that will encourage different departments to work together and communicate grinney will never work out of the new building his last day as ceo is dec  though hell stay on as a consultant through the spring of next year chief operating officer mark tarr who has been second in command for nearly a decade of his  year career at the company will succeed grinney healthsouth announced his retirement the same day the company announced something that seemed impossibly far away at the time he was hired a strong third quarter with revenues topping 9 million i cannot envision a better scenario to step aside from grinney said  view comments board of
