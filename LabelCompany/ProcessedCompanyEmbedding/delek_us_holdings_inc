dorado arkansas currently representing a combined  bpd of crude throughput capacity our refining system produces a variety of petroleumbased products used in transportation and industrial markets which are sold to a wide range of customers located principally in inland domestic markets both of our refineries are located in the us gulf coast region padd  which is one of the five padd regional zones established by the us department of energy where refined products are produced and sold refined product prices generally differ among each of the five padds our refining segment also includes two biodiesel facilities we own and operate that are engaged in the production of biodiesel fuels and related activities located in crossett arkansas and cleburne texas refining system feedstock purchases our refining system purchases crude oil and other feedstocks through short term agreements some of which may include renewal provisions and through spot market transactions the majority of the crude oil we purchase is sourced from inland domestic sources primarily originating in areas of texas and arkansas we also have the ability to purchase crude delivered by rail car that originates primarily in other parts of the united states and canada a large portion of the crude oil currently purchased at both the tyler and el dorado refineries is priced at a differential to the price per barrel of wti in most cases this differential is established during the month prior to the month in which the crude oil is processed at our refineries refining system production slate our refining system processes a combination of light sweet and medium sour crude oils which when refined results in a product mix consisting principally of highervalue transportation fuels such as gasoline distillate and jet fuel a lesser portion of our overall production consists of residual products including paving asphalt roofing flux and other products with industrial applications refined product sales and distribution our refining segment sells products on a wholesale basis to intercompany and thirdparty customers located around east texas arkansas tennessee and the ohio river valley including gulf coast markets and areas along the enterprise pipeline system and along the colonial pipeline system through exchanges refining segment seasonality demand for gasoline and asphalt products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in motor vehicle traffic and road and home construction varying vapor pressure requirements between the summer and winter months also tighten summer gasoline supply as a result the operating results of our refining segment are generally lower for the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year  refining segment competition the refining industry is highly competitive and includes fully integrated national and multinational oil companies engaged in many segments of the petroleum business including exploration production transportation refining marketing and retail fuel and convenience stores our principal competitors are petroleum refiners in the midcontinent and gulf coast regions in addition to wholesale distributors operating in these markets the principal competitive factors affecting our refinery operations are crude oil and other feedstock costs the differential in price between various grades of crude oil refinery product margins refinery reliability and efficiency refinery product mix and distribution and transportation costs refining segment  tyler refinery our tyler refinery has a nameplate crude throughput capacity of  bpd the refinery is situated on approximately  out of a total of approximately  contiguous acres of land excluding pipelines that we own in tyler texas and adjacent areas the tyler refinery is currently the only major distributor of a full range of refined petroleum products within a radius of approximately  miles of its location the tyler refinery is designed to process mainly light sweet crude oil which is typically of a higher quality than heavier sour crudes the tyler refinery has access to crude oil pipeline systems that allow us access to east texas west texas and limited gulf of mexico and foreign crude oils most of the crude supplied to the tyler refinery is delivered by thirdparty pipelines

addition to highervalue gasoline and distillate fuels the tyler refinery produces small quantities of propane refinery grade propylene and butanes petroleum coke slurry oil sulfur and other blendstocks  the chart below sets forth information concerning the tyler refinerys production slate click to enlarge the vast majority of our transportation fuels and other products produced at the tyler refinery are sold directly from a refined products terminal owned by delek logistics and located at the refinery we believe this allows our customers to benefit from lower transportation costs compared to alternative sources our customers include major oil companies independent refiners and marketers jobbers distributors utility and transportation companies the us government and independent retail fuel operators taking into account the tyler refinerys crude and refined product slate as well as the refinerys location near the gulf coast region we apply the us gulf coast  crack spread gulf coast crack spread to calculate the approximate gross margin resulting from processing one barrel of crude oil into threefifths of a barrel of gasoline and twofifths of a barrel of high sulfur diesel we calculate the gulf coast crack spread using the market values of us gulf coast pipeline cbob and us gulf coast pipeline no  heating oil highsulfur diesel and the market value of wti crude oil

a crude throughput capacity of  bpd the el dorado site consists of approximately  acres of which the main plant and associated tank farms adjacent to the refinery sit on approximately  acres the el dorado refinery is the largest refinery in arkansas and represents more than  of statewide refining capacity the el dorado refinery is designed mainly to process a wide variety of crude oil ranging from light sweet to heavy sour the refinery receives crude by several delivery points including local crude and other thirdparty pipelines that connect directly into delek logistics el dorado pipeline system which runs from magnolia arkansas to the el dorado refinery the el dorado pipeline system and rail at thirdparty terminals  in   we purchased crude oil for the el dorado refinery from inland sources in east and west texas south arkansas and north louisiana through a crude oil gathering system owned and operated by delek logistics the sala gathering system via rail and from the gulf coast at present j aron and company j aron through arrangements with various oil companies supplies a substantial portion of the el dorado refinerys crude oil input requirements pursuant to an amended and

refinery are sold to wholesalers and retailers through spot sales commercial contracts and exchange agreements in markets in arkansas memphis tennessee and north into the ohio river valley region the el dorado refinery connection via the logistics segment to the enterprise pipeline system is a key means of product distribution for the refinery because it provides access to thirdparty terminals in multiple midcontinent markets located adjacent to the system the el dorado refinery also supplies products to these markets through product exchanges on the colonial pipeline system logistics segment overview our logistics segment consists of delek logistics a publicly traded master limited partnership and its subsidiaries our consolidated financial statements include its consolidated financial results as of december    we owned a  limited partner interest in delek logistics and a  interest in logistics gp which owns both the entire  general partner interest in delek logistics and all of the incentive distribution rights our logistics segment generates revenue and contribution margin which we define as net sales less cost of goods sold and operating expenses by charging fees for gathering transporting and storing crude oil and intermediate product and for marketing distributing transporting and storing refined products a substantial majority of the logistics segments existing assets are both integral to and dependent upon the successful operation of our refining segments assets as the logistics segment gathers transports and stores crude oil and markets distributes transports  and stores refined products in select regions of the southeastern united states and east texas in support of the tyler and el dorado refineries in addition to intercompany services the logistics segment also provides some crude oil and refined product transportation services for and terminalling and wholesale marketing services to third parties in texas tennessee and arkansas the logistics segment owns nine light product distribution terminals one in each of nashville and memphis tennessee tyler big sandy san angelo abilene and mount pleasant texas and north little rock and el dorado

refined product produced at the tyler refinery logistics segment  pipelines and transportation the logistics segments pipelines and transportation business owns or leases capacity on approximately  miles of crude oil transportation pipelines approximately  miles of refined product pipelines an approximately  mile crude oil gathering system and associated crude oil  storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately  million barrels of active shell capacity these assets are primarily divided into the following operating systems • the lion pipeline system which transports crude oil to and refined products from the el dorado refinery the lion pipeline system • the sala gathering system which gathers and transports crude oil production in southern arkansas and northern louisiana primarily for the el dorado refinery • the paline pipeline system which primarily transports crude oil from longview texas to thirdparty facilities in nederland texas • the east texas crude logistics system which currently transports a portion of the crude oil delivered to the tyler refinery the east texas crude logistics system • the tylerbig sandy pipeline which is a pipeline link between the tyler refinery and the big sandy terminal • the tyler tank assets • the el dorado tank assets and • the greenvillemount pleasant pipeline and greenville storage facility in addition to these operating systems the logistics segment owns approximately  trucks and  trailers used to haul primarily crude oil and other hydrocarbon products for us and for third parties joint ventures the logistics segment owns a portion of two joint ventures that have constructed logistics assets which serve third parties and the refining segment these assets include the following • a  interest in an mile crude oil pipeline with a capacity of  bpd that originates in longview texas with destinations in the shreveport louisiana area the caddo pipeline and • a  interest in a mile crude oil pipeline with an initial capacity of  bpd with the capability to expand to  bpd that originates in north loving county texas near the texasnew mexico border and terminates in midland texas the rio pipeline the rio pipeline project has been completed and began operations in september  the caddo pipeline has been substantially completed and operations began in january  logistics segment supply agreement approximately  of the petroleum products for sale by the logistics segment in west texas are purchased from noble petro inc noble petro under the terms of a supply contract the abilene contract with noble petro we have the right to purchase up to  bpd of petroleum products under the abilene contract we purchase petroleum products based on monthly average prices from noble petro immediately prior to our resale of such products to customers at our san angelo and abilene texas terminals which we lease to noble petro under this arrangement we have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating prices for these refined products due to the short period of time between the purchase and resale of these refined products the abilene contract expires in december  and does not have a renewal option we also purchase finished products from the refining segment and from other third parties logistics segment operating agreements with delek delek logistics has various longterm feebased commercial agreements with delek and its subsidiaries that among other things establish fees for certain administrative and operational services provided by delek and its subsidiaries to delek logistics provide certain indemnification obligations and establish terms for feebased commercial agreements for delek logistics to provide certain pipeline transportation terminal throughput finished product marketing and storage services to delek these agreements have various initial terms which expire depending on the specific contracts at different times from  through  delek has opted to renew the agreements expiring in november  for subsequent fiveyear terms each of these agreements requires delek or a delek subsidiary to pay for certain minimum volume commitments or certain minimum storage capacities delek logistics is a variable interest entity as defined under united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is consolidated into our consolidated financial statements intercompany transactions with delek logistics and its subsidiaries are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements logistics segment customers in addition to certain of our subsidiaries our logistics segment has various types of customers including major oil companies independent refiners and marketers jobbers distributors utility and transportation companies and independent retail fuel operators  logistics segment seasonality the volume and throughput of crude oil and refined products transported through our pipelines and sold through our terminals and to third parties is directly affected by the level of supply and demand for all of such products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets supply and demand for such products fluctuates during the calendar year demand for gasoline for example is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in motor vehicle traffic varying vapor pressure requirements between the summer and winter months also tighten summer gasoline supply in addition our refining segment often performs planned maintenance during the winter when demand for their products is lower accordingly these factors can diminish the demand for crude oil or finished products by our customers and therefore limit our volumes or throughput during these periods and we expect that our operating results will generally be lower during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year logistics segment competition our logistics segment faces competition for the transportation of crude oil from other pipeline owners whose pipelines i may have a location advantage over our pipelines ii may be able to transport more desirable crude oil to third parties or iii may be able to transport crude oil or finished product at a lower tariff in addition the wholesale marketing and terminalling business in general is also very competitive our owned refined product terminals as well as the other thirdparty terminals we use to sell refined products compete with other independent terminal operators as well as integrated oil companies on the basis of terminal location price versatility and services provided the costs associated with transporting products from a loading terminal to end users limit the geographic size of the market that can be competitively served by any terminal two key markets in west texas that we serve from our companyowned facilities are abilene and san angelo texas we have direct competition from an independent refinery that markets through another terminal in the abilene market there are no competitive fuel loading terminals within approximately  miles of our san angelo terminal logistics segment activity the following table summarizes our activity in the

continued our efforts to improve several areas of it including infrastructure security and enterprise software systems capital investments in infrastructure involved the continued migration of onpremise data center hardware to multiple offsite data center locations to improve the reliability and availability of it services to our corporate and refinery locations in addition we migrated our enterprise resource planning architecture to the cloud and deployed the sap hana database which allowed us to take advantage of available realtime reporting and analytics features a new hr information system was also implemented taking advantage of cloud technology and providing an improved selfservice approach to managing human capital utilized by management and employees alike also additional security technologies and enhancements were deployed to harden our existing infrastructure in the corporate environment as well as the control systems at our refineries the energy sector continues to be the target of cyber attack perpetrators and we believe the steps we have taken and continue to take will help us maintain adequate data security in an environment of increasing risk of cyber attacks hacks and other threats governmental regulation and environmental matters rate regulation of petroleum pipelines the rates and terms and conditions of service on certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act “ica” and by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we transport crude oil intermediate and refined products including the railroad commission of texas the louisiana public service commission and the arkansas public service commission certain of our pipeline systems are subject to such regulation and have filed tariffs with the appropriate authorities we also comply with the reporting requirements for these pipelines other of our pipelines have received a waiver from application of the fercs tariff requirements but comply with other applicable regulatory requirements the ferc regulates interstate transportation under the ica the energy policy act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws the ica and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines including pipelines that transport crude oil intermediate and refined products in interstate commerce collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines” be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the ferc under the ica shippers may challenge new or existing rates or services the ferc is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months though rates are typically not suspended for the maximum allowable period our tariff rates are typically contractually subject to increase or decrease on july  of each year by the amount of any change in various inflationbased indices including the ferc oil pipeline index the consumer price index and the producer price index provided however that in no event will the fees be adjusted below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement while ferc regulates rates for shipments of crude oil or refined products in interstate commerce state agencies may regulate rates and services for shipments in intrastate commerce we own pipeline assets in texas arkansas and louisiana accordingly such assets may be subject to additional regulation by the applicable governmental authorities in those states environmental health and safety we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations enforced by various agencies including the epa the united states department of transportation the occupational safety and health administration the texas commission on environmental quality the railroad commission of texas the arkansas department of environmental quality the adeq the tennessee department of environment and conservation and the louisiana department of natural resources as well as other state and federal agencies these laws and regulations govern the discharge of materials into the environment waste management practices pollution prevention measures and the composition of the fuels we produce as well as the safe operation of our plants and pipelines and the safety of our workers and the public numerous permits or other authorizations are required under these laws and regulations for the operation of our refineries biodiesel facilities terminals pipelines trucks rail cars and related operations and may be subject to revocation modification and renewal these laws and permits raise potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental and safety matters which could include soil and water contamination air pollution personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we manufactured handled used released or disposed of transported or that relate to preexisting conditions for which we have assumed responsibility we believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with existing environmental and safety requirements however there have been and will continue to be ongoing discussions about environmental and safety matters between us and federal and state authorities including notices of violations citations and other enforcement actions some of which have resulted or may result in changes to operating procedures and in capital expenditures while it is often difficult to quantify future environmental or safety related expenditures we anticipate that continuing capital investments and changes in operating procedures will be required for the foreseeable future to comply with existing and new requirements as well as evolving interpretations and more strict enforcement of existing laws and regulations we anticipate that compliance with environmental health and safety regulations will require us to spend approximately  million in capital costs in  and approximately  million during the next five years  these estimates do not include amounts related to capital investments that management has deemed to be strategic investments these amounts could materially change as a result of governmental and regulatory actions we generate wastes that may be subject to the rcra and comparable state and local requirements the epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of managing transporting recycling and disposal of hazardous and certain nonhazardous wastes our refineries are large quantity generators of hazardous waste and require hazardous waste permits issued by epa or state agencies other of our facilities such as terminals and biodiesel plants generate lesser quantities of hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment analogous state laws impose similar responsibilities and liabilities on responsible parties in the course of our ordinary operations our various businesses generate waste some of which falls within the statutory definition of a hazardous substance and some of which may have been disposed of at sites that may require future cleanup under superfund at this time our el dorado refinery has been named as a minor potentially responsible party at one site for which we believe future costs will not be material as of december    we have recorded an environmental liability of approximately  million  primarily related to the estimated probable costs of remediating or otherwise addressing certain environmental issues of a noncapital nature at the tyler and el dorado refineries this liability includes estimated costs for ongoing investigation and remediation efforts which were already being performed by the former operators of the tyler and el dorado refineries prior to our acquisition of those facilities for known contamination of soil and groundwater as well as estimated costs for additional issues which have been identified subsequent to the acquisitions we expect approximately  million of this amount to be reimbursable by a prior owner of the el dorado refinery which we have recorded in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december    approximately  million of the total liability is expected to be expended over the next  months with most of the balance expended by  in the future we could be required to extend the expected remediation period or undertake additional investigations of our refineries pipelines and terminal facilities which could result in additional remediation liabilities the epa issued final rules for gasoline formulation that required the reduction of average benzene content by january   and the reduction of maximum annual average benzene content by july   it is necessary for us to purchase credits to fully comply with these content requirements for the tyler refinery although credits have been acquired that should be sufficient to cover our obligations through  there can be no assurance that such credits will be available in the future or that we will be able to purchase available credits at reasonable prices additional benzene reduction projects may be implemented to reduce or eliminate our need to purchase benzene credits depending on the availability and cost of such credits future capital projects at the tyler refinery may also impact our need to purchase benzene credits in recent years various legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides have been discussed or implemented they include proposed and enacted federal regulation and state actions to develop statewide regional or nationwide programs designed to control and reduce ghg emissions from fixed sources such as our refineries power plants and oil and gas production operations as well as mobile transportation sources and fuels we are not aware of any state or regional initiatives for controlling existing ghg emissions that would affect our refineries although it is not possible to predict the requirements of any ghg legislation that may be enacted any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce ghg emissions will likely require us to incur increased operating and capital costs and result in decreased demand for our petroleum fuels in august  the epa finalized the “clean power plan” requiring states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal fired power plants through a combination of plant closures switching to renewable energy and natural gas and demand reduction the clean power plan is currently being litigated in various courts and the us supreme court has stayed implementation pending the outcome of those legal challenges if upheld this rule will not directly affect our operations the epa has indicated that it intends to regulate refinery ghg emissions from new and existing sources through a new source performance standard nsps although there is no firm proposal or date for such regulation and the epa has said that such a performance standard is not imminent our operations are subject to certain requirements of the federal clean air act “caa” as well as related state and local laws and regulations governing air emission certain caa regulatory programs applicable to our refineries terminals and other operations require capital expenditures for the installation of air pollution control devices operational procedures to minimize emissions and monitoring and reporting of emissions in mid the epa announced an industrywide enforcement initiative directed at flaring operations and performance at refineries and petrochemical plants in september  the epa finalized revisions to the nsps for petroleum refineries nsps subpart ja that primarily affects flares and process heaters the nsps impacted the way some flares at our tyler and el dorado refineries are designed andor operated and capital projects were completed at our tyler refinery in  related to meeting this nsps we believe our flares and process heaters meet the applicable requirements and our refineries have not received any associated inquiries or requests for information nor are they a party to any associated enforcement action at this time in  epa finalized reductions in the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone from  ppb to  ppb our tyler refinery is located in an area reclassified as nonattainment with the new standard while we do not yet know what specific actions we will be required to take or when it is possible we will have to install additional air pollution control equipment for ozone forming emissions or change the formulation  of gasoline we make for use in some areas we do not believe such capital expenditures or the changes in our operation will result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations on december   the epa published final rules under the risk and technology review provisions of the clean air act to further regulate refinery air emissions through additional nsps and maximum achievable control technology requirements the “refinery sector rules” the final rules will require capital expenditures for additional controls on the tyler refinery’s coker and for the relief systems flares tanks and other sources at both refineries as well as requiring changes to the way we operate start up and maintain some process units the final rule also requires that we monitor property line benzene concentrations beginning in january  and provide the results to the epa quarterly which will make the results available to the public beginning in  even though the concentrations are not expected to exceed regulatory or health based standards the availability of such data may increase the likelihood of lawsuits against our refineries by the local public or organized public interest groups we do not anticipate that the required capital and operating costs will be material and do not believe compliance will affect our production capacities or have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition or results of operations on november   epa finalized the renewable fuel volume obligations for   and  that represented yearoveryear changes of   and  respectively on november   the epa finalized the renewable fuel obligation for  at  over the  volume the  and  ethanol volumes exceed the  ethanol “blendwall” requiring increased usage of higher ethanol blends such as e and e the epa has historically used its waiver authority to establish volumes lower than the statutory volumes required by the energy independence and security act with the exception of the volumes for biomassbased diesel and for ethanol in  but the epas interpretation of its waiver authority has been challenged in federal court although our refineries have met and retired their  and  obligations we were unable to blend sufficient quantities of ethanol and biodiesel to meet our  obligation and had to purchase rins on a consolidated basis we purchased approximately  million rins to meet our  obligation for our refineries  obligation we estimate we will have to purchase approximately  million to  million rins it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty what those volumes or costs may be but given the increase in required volumes and the volatile price of rins the increase in renewable volume requirements for  could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are unable to recover those costs in the price of our refined products the epa finalized tier  gasoline rules in march  the final tier  rule requires a reduction in annual average gasoline sulfur content from  ppm to  ppm and retains the current maximum pergallon sulfur content of  ppm larger refineries must comply with the  ppm sulfur standard by january   but the final rule provides a threeyear waiver period to january   for small volume refineries that processed less than  bpd in  both of our refineries meet this waiver provision we anticipate that the tyler refinery will meet these new limits when they become effective with only minor operational changes and that a capital project will be required for additional sulfur removal capacity at the el dorado refinery  some loss of octane may occur as a result of changes in operation of the gasoline desulfurization units but we anticipate this loss will be mitigated through operational adjustments and modifications to other gasoline processes in the refineries   compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in april  the epa issued a final rule requiring small volume refineries that increase their annual average crude processing rate above  bpd to meet the tier  sulfur limits  months from that “disqualifying” date we do not anticipate that this rule will affect our refineries our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act “cwa” the oil pollution act of  “opa” and comparable state and local requirements the cwa and similar laws prohibit any discharge into surface waters ground waters injection wells and publiclyowned treatment works except as allowed by pretreatment permits and national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permits issued by federal state and local governmental agencies the opa prohibits the discharge of oil into waters of the us and requires that affected facilities have plans in place to respond to spills and other discharges the cwa also regulates filling or discharges to wetlands and other waters of the us in  the epa in conjunction with the army corps of engineers issued a final rule regarding the definition of “waters of the us” which expanded the regulatory reach of the existing clean water regulations although the final rule is currently stayed pending litigation if the rule becomes enforceable it could increase costs for expanding our facilities or constructing new facilities including pipelines we have experienced several crude oil releases from pipelines owned by our logistics segment including but not limited to a release at magnolia station in march  a release near fouke arkansas in april  and a release near woodville texas in january  in june  the united states department of justice notified delek logistics that they were evaluating an enforcement action on behalf of the epa with regard to potential cwa violations arising from the march  magnolia station release we are currently attempting to negotiate a resolution to this matter with the epa and the adeq which may include monetary penalties andor other relief based on current information available to us we do not believe the total costs associated with these events whether alone or in the aggregate including any fines or penalties will have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition or results of operations employees as of

should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form k in evaluating us and our common stock any of the risk factors described below or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the headings provided in this item a are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the extent or interpretation of the risk factors risks relating to our industries our refining margins have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile which may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows our earnings cash flow and profitability from our refining operations are substantially determined by the difference between the market price of refined products and the market price of crude oil which is referred to as the crack spread refining margin or refined products margin refining margins historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile as a result of numerous factors beyond our control including volatility in the prices of the various types of crude oil and other feedstocks purchased by our refineries volatility in the costs of natural gas and electricity used by our refineries and volatility in the prices of gasoline and other refined petroleum products sold by our refineries although we monitor our refinery operating margins and seek to optimize results by adjusting throughput volumes throughput types and product slates there are inherent limitations on our ability to offset the effects of adverse market conditions for example although there are differences between published prices and margins and those experienced in our operations certain published data illustrate the volatility we encounter the nymex price for domestic light sweet crude oil nymex cl the argus

oil differential per barrel               such volatility is affected by among other things • changes in global and local economic conditions • domestic and foreign supply and demand for crude oil and refined products • the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined petroleum products • increased regulation of feedstock production activities such as hydraulic fracturing • infrastructure limitations that restrict or events that disrupt the distribution of crude oil other feedstocks and refined petroleum products • an increase or decrease of infrastructure limitations or the perception that such an increase or decrease could occur on the distribution of crude oil other feedstocks or refined products • investor speculation in commodities • worldwide political conditions particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the middle east africa the former soviet union and south america • the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to maintain oil price and production controls • pricing and other actions taken by competitors that impact the market • the level of crude oil other feedstocks and refined petroleum products imported into and exported out of the united states • excess capacity and utilization rates of refineries worldwide  • development and marketing of alternative and competing fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel • changes in fuel specifications required by environmental and other laws particularly with respect to oxygenates and sulfur content • local factors including market conditions adverse weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets • accidents interruptions in transportation inclement weather or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries or the supply and delivery of crude oil from third parties and • united states government regulations the crude oil we purchase and the refined products we sell are commodities whose prices are mainly determined by market forces beyond our control while an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil will often result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the wholesale price of refined products a change in the price of one commodity does not always result in a corresponding change in the other a substantial or prolonged increase in crude oil prices without a corresponding increase in refined product prices or a substantial or prolonged decrease in refined product prices without a corresponding decrease in crude oil prices could also have a significant negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows this is especially true for nontransportation refined products such as asphalt butane coke sulfur propane and slurry whose prices are less likely to correlate to fluctuations in the price of crude oil all of which we produce at our refineries also the price for a significant portion of the crude oil processed at our refineries is based upon the wti benchmark for such oil rather than the brent benchmark while the prices for wti and brent historically corresponded to one another elevated supply of wtipriced crude oil in the midcontinent region has caused wti prices to fall significantly below brent prices at different points in time in recent years during the years ended december   and december    this daily differential ranged from highs of  and   respectively to lows of  and   respectively our ability to purchase and process favorably priced crude oils has allowed us to achieve higher net income and cash flow in recent years however we cannot assure you that these favorable conditions will continue a substantial or prolonged narrowing in or inversion to the price differential between the wti and brent benchmarks for any reason including without limitation increased crude oil distribution capacity from the permian basin crude oil exports from the united states or actual or perceived reductions in midcontinent crude oil inventories could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows in addition because the premium or discount we pay for a portion of the crude oil processed at our refineries is established based upon this differential during the month prior to the month in which the crude oil is processed rapid decreases in the differential may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future laws regulations and other requirements could significantly increase our costs of doing business thereby adversely affecting our profitability our industry is subject to extensive laws regulations permits and other requirements including but not limited to those relating to the environment fuel composition safety transportation pipeline tariffs employment labor immigration minimum wages overtime pay health care benefits working conditions public accessibility and other requirements these permits laws and regulations are enforced by federal agencies including the epa united states department of transportation pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration federal motor carrier safety administration federal railroad administration osha national labor relations board equal employment opportunity commission federal trade commission and ferc and state agencies such as the texas commission on environmental quality arkansas department of environmental quality railroad commission of texas and tennessee department of environment and conservation as well as numerous other state and federal agencies we anticipate that compliance with environmental health and safety regulations will require us to spend approximately  million in capital costs in  and approximately  million during the next five years these estimates do not include amounts related to capital investments that management has deemed to be strategic investments these amounts could materially change as a result of governmental and regulatory actions various permits licenses registrations and other authorizations are required under these laws for the operation of our refineries terminals pipelines and related operations and these permits are subject to renewal and modification that may require operational changes involving significant costs if key permits cannot be renewed or are revoked the ability to continue operation of the affected facilities could be threatened ongoing compliance with or violation of laws regulations and other requirements could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters including but not limited to soil groundwater and waterway contamination air pollution personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances we manufactured handled used released or disposed we are and have been the subject of various state federal and private proceedings relating to environmental regulations conditions and inquiries in addition new legal requirements new interpretations of existing legal requirements increased legislative activity and governmental enforcement and other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures companies in the petroleum industry such as us are often the target of activist and regulatory activity regarding pricing safety environmental compliance derivatives trading and other business practices which could result in price controls fines increased taxes or other actions affecting the conduct of our business for example consumer activists are lobbying various authorities to enact laws and regulations mandating the removal of tetraethyl lead from aviation gasoline  and efforts are underway by the federal aviation administration to find a suitable replacement fuel which could affect production of aviation gasoline at our tyler refinery other activists seek to require reductions in ghg emissions from our refineries and fuel products and are increasingly protesting new energy infrastructure projects such as pipelines and crude by rail facilities the specific impact of laws and regulations or other actions may vary depending on a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities marketing areas crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes we generate wastes that may be subject to the rcra and comparable state and local requirements the epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of managing transporting recycling and disposal of hazardous and certain nonhazardous wastes our refineries are large quantity generators of hazardous waste and require hazardous waste permits issued by the epa or state agencies additionally certain of our other facilities such as terminals and biodiesel plants generate lesser quantities of hazardous wastes ongoing compliance with laws regulations and other requirements could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations under rcra and the cercla and other federal state and local environmental requirements as the owner or operator of refineries biodiesel plants bulk terminals pipelines tank farms rail cars and trucks we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at our existing or former locations whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such contamination we have incurred such liability in the past and several of our current and former locations are the subject of ongoing remediation projects the failure to timely report and properly remediate contamination may subject us to liability to third parties and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent our property or to borrow money using our property as collateral additionally persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of these substances at sites where they are located regardless of whether the site is owned or operated by that person we typically arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances in our refining and other operations therefore we may be liable for removal or remediation costs as well as other related costs including fines penalties and damages resulting from injuries to persons property and natural resources our el dorado refinery is a minor potentially responsible party at a superfund site for which we expect our costs to be immaterial in the future we may incur substantial expenditures for investigation or remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at our current or former locations or locations that we may acquire our operations are subject to certain requirements of the federal clean air act “caa” as well as related state and local laws and regulations governing air emissions certain caa regulatory programs applicable to our refineries terminals and other operations require capital expenditures for the installation of air pollution control devices operational procedures to minimize emissions and monitoring and reporting of emissions in  the epa announced an industrywide enforcement initiative directed at flaring operations and performance at refineries and petrochemical plants and finalized revisions to nsps subpart ja that primarily affects flares and process heaters we completed capital projects at our refineries related to flare compliance with nsps ja in  we believe our existing process heaters meet the applicable nsps ja requirements and our refineries have not received any inquiries or requests for information from the epa regarding flaring operations and are not a party to any associated enforcement action at this time in  epa finalized reductions in the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone from  ppb to  ppb our tyler refinery is located in an area reclassified as nonattainment with the new standard while we do not yet know what specific actions we will be required to take or when it is possible we will have to install additional air pollution control equipment for ozone forming emissions or change the formulation of gasoline we make for use in some areas we do not believe such capital expenditures or the changes in our operation will result in a material adverse effect on our business in late  the epa finalized additional rules regulating refinery air emissions from a variety of sources such as cokers flares tanks and other process units through additional nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants and changing the way emissions from startup shutdown and malfunction operations are regulated the refinery risk and technology review rules or “rtr” the rtr rule also requires that starting in january  we monitor property line benzene concentrations at our refineries and starting in  report those concentrations quarterly to epa which will make the results available to the public even though the concentrations are not expected to exceed regulatory or health based standards the availability of such data may increase the likelihood of lawsuits against our refineries by the local public or organized public interest groups compliance with the rules will require additional capital projects and changes in the way we operate some equipment over the next three years but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition to our operations many of the fuel products we manufacture are subject to requirements of the caa as well as related state and local laws and regulations the epa has the authority under the caa to modify the formulation of the refined transportation fuel products we manufacture in order to limit the emissions associated with their final use in  the epa issued final mobile source air toxic ii rules for gasoline formulation that required the reduction of average benzene content beginning january   and the reduction of maximum annual average benzene content by july   we currently purchase credits to comply with these content requirements for one of our refineries although credits have been readily available there can be no assurance that such credits will continue to be available for purchase at reasonable prices or at all and we could have to implement capital projects in the future to reduce benzene levels  in march  the epa issued final tier  gasoline rules that require a reduction in annual average gasoline sulfur content from  ppm to  ppm by january   for large refineries and retains the current maximum pergallon sulfur content limit of  ppm under the final rules both our refineries are considered “small refineries” and are exempt from complying with the rules requirements until january   we anticipate that the tyler refinery will meet these new limits when they become effective with only minor operational changes and that a capital project will be required for additional sulfur removal capacity at the el dorado refinery  some loss of octane may occur as a result of changes in operation of the gasoline desulfurization units but we anticipate this loss will be mitigated through operational adjustments and modifications to other gasoline processes in the refineries   compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in april  the epa finalized a change to the tier  standard requiring small volume refineries that increase their annual average crude processing rate above  bpd to meet the tier  sulfur limits  months from that “disqualifying” date we do not anticipate that this rule change will affect our refineries our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act “cwa” the oil pollution act of  “opa” and comparable state and local requirements the cwa and similar laws prohibit any discharge into surface waters ground waters injection wells and publiclyowned treatment works except as allowed by pretreatment permits and national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permits issued by federal state and local governmental agencies the opa prohibits the discharge of oil into waters of the us and requires that affected facilities have plans in place to respond to spills and other discharges the cwa also regulates filling or discharges to wetlands and other waters of the us in  the epa in conjunction with the army corps of engineers issued a final rule regarding the definition of “waters of the us” which expanded the regulatory reach of the existing clean water regulations although the final rule is currently stayed pending litigation if the rule becomes enforceable it could increase costs for expanding our facilities or constructing new facilities including pipelines we are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation and various state agencies in connection with our pipeline trucking and rail transportation operations these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing activities such as the authorization to operate hazardous materials pipelines and engage in motor carrier operations there are additional regulations specifically relating to the transportation industry including integrity management of pipelines testing and specification of equipment product handling and labeling requirements and personnel qualifications the transportation industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of our business by requiring changes in operating practices or pipeline construction or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing trucking services possible changes include among other things increasingly stringent environmental regulations increased frequency and stringency for testing and repairing pipelines replacement of older pipelines changes in the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size and properties of the materials that can be shipped required changes to the specifications governing rail cars carrying crude oil will eliminate the most commonly used tank car or require that such cars be upgraded in january  phmsa announced they were considering limits on the volatility of crude oil that could be shipped by rail and other modes of transportation these rules could limit the availability of tank cars to transport crude to our refineries and increase the cost of crude oil transported by rail or truck in addition to the substantial remediation costs that could be caused by leaks or spills from our pipelines regulators could prohibit our use of affected portions of the pipeline for extended periods thereby interrupting the delivery of crude oil to or the distribution of refined products from our refineries our operations are subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety and process safety administered by osha epa and various state equivalent agencies we maintain safety training design standards mechanical integrity and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and protect the safety of our workers and the public more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by government agencies could have an adverse effect on our financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures for the installation and operation of systems and equipment health and safety legislation and regulations change frequently we cannot predict what additional health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures future process safety rules could also mandate changes to the way we operate the processes and chemicals we use and the materials from which our process units are constructed such regulations could have a significant negative effect on our operations and profitability for example in response to executive order  improving chemical facility safety and security osha announced it intends to propose comprehensive changes to the process safety requirements in january  the epa finalized changes to process safety requirements in its risk management program rules that require evaluation of safer alternatives and technologies expanded routine audits independent thirdparty audits following certain process safety events and increased sharing of information with the public and emergency response organizations environmental regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental and safety laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed compliance with any future legislation or regulation of our produced fuels including renewable fuel or carbon content ghg emissions sulfur benzene or other toxic content vapor pressure octane or other fuel characteristics may result in increased capital and operating costs and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition while it is impractical to predict the impact that potential regulatory and activist activity may have such future activity may result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities as well  as increased capital outlays to improve our facilities such future activity could also adversely affect our ability to expand production result in damaging publicity about us or reduce demand for our products our need to incur costs associated with complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements that are substantial and not adequately provided for could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act is comprehensive financial reform legislation that among other things establishes comprehensive federal oversight and regulation of overthecounter derivatives and many of the entities that participate in that market although the doddfrank act was enacted on july   the commodity futures trading commission or cftc and the sec along with certain other regulators must promulgate final rules and regulations to implement many of the doddfrank acts provisions relating to overthecounter derivatives while some of these rules have been finalized others have not and as a result the final form and timing of the implementation of the new regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain finally the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” as well as other health care reform legislation being considered by congress and state legislatures may have an impact on our business as of december    we had  employees of whom  were employed in our refining segment  were employed by delek for the benefit of our logistics segment and  were employed by holdings although many of the rules reforms and regulations required to implement the aca have not yet been adopted and consequently the precise costs of complying with the aca remain unknown an increase in our employee health care related costs appears likely and that increase could be extensive and changes to our health care cost structure could have a significant negative impact on our business increased supply of and demand for alternative transportation fuels increased fuel economy standards and increased use of alternative means of transportation could lead to a decrease in transportation fuel prices andor a reduction in demand for petroleumbased transportation fuels a shortage of rins could require that our refineries operate at reduced production rates or require us to incur a high cost to meet our rins obligations that might not be recoverable in the price of our products pursuant to the eisa the epa promulgated rfs requiring refiners to blend renewable fuels such as ethanol biodiesel and other advanced biofuels with their petroleum fuels or purchase rins in lieu of blending the volume of renewable fuels required by the eisa increased from  billion gallons in  to  billion gallons in  and will increase to  billion gallons in  the epa has set annual volumes beneath the statutory levels each year because of the unavailability of certain advanced biofuels and to avoid exceeding  ethanol in the gasoline supply the blendwall but this decision has been challenged in federal court annually the epa establishes the volume of renewable fuels that refineries must blend into their finished petroleum fuels as a percentage of their domestic gasoline and diesel sales based on estimated demand for gasoline and diesel and the final biofuel volumes established by the epa each year meeting rfs requires displacing increasing amounts of petroleumbased transportation fuels with biofuels beginning with approximately  in   in  and  in  while we are able to obtain many of the rins required for compliance by blending renewable fuels manufactured by third parties or by our own biodiesel plants we must also purchase rins on the open market if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance with rfs on to our customers our profits will be adversely impacted moreover the market prices for rins have been volatile if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase or if we are otherwise unable to meet the rfs mandates our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected meeting the rfs volume requirements will require more ethanol to be blended than can be achieved with  ethanol gasoline blends e the volumes of ethanol required to meet the  and  requirements exceed  ethanol in the nationwide gasoline pool in  the epa approved e for use in model year  and later vehicles however studies show that e may cause engine and fuel system damage and most vehicle manufacturers do not recommend using e in vehicles manufactured prior to  or  other than flex fuel vehicles in addition most existing underground storage tanks ust and retail dispenser systems are not certified by underwriters laboratory local fire codes or the epa for use with gasoline blends containing more than  ethanol flex fuel vehicles can utilize higher ethanol blends up to e but there are relatively few such vehicles on the road there are few e retail locations and the use of e results in significant reductions in fuel economy these and other impediments may present challenges to blending the required volumes of ethanol if adequate supplies of the required types of biofuels are unavailable in volumes sufficient to meet our requirement if we are unable to physically blend the required biofuel volumes without exceeding  ethanol or if rins are not available in sufficient volumes or at economical prices refinery production or profitability could be negatively affected in addition as regulatory initiatives have required an increase in the consumption of renewable transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel consumer acceptance of electric hybrid and other alternative vehicles is increasing increased use of renewable fuels and alternative vehicles may result in a decrease in demand for petroleumbased transportation fuels increased use of renewable fuels may also result in an increase in transportation fuel supply relative to decreased demand and a corresponding decrease in margins a significant decrease in transportation fuel margins or demand for petroleumbased transportation fuels could have an adverse impact on our financial results as described above rfs requires replacement of increasing amounts of petroleumbased transportation fuels with biofuels through  rfs and widespread  use of e or e could cause decreased crude runs and materially affect our profitability unless fuel demand rises at a comparable rate or other outlets are found for the displaced petroleum products finally the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa finalized new standards that raised the required corporate average fuel economy cafe of the nations passenger fleet to approximately  mpg by  and imposed the firstever federal ghg emissions standards on cars and light trucks in september  the epa and the department of transportation finalized firsttime standards for fuel economy of medium and heavy duty trucks in september  the epa and nhtsa finalized rules raising the cafe and ghg standards for passenger vehicles beginning with  model year vehicles and increasing to the equivalent of  mpg by  these standards were reaffirmed by the epa in january  additional increases in fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty vehicles were finalized in august  such increases in fuel economy standards and potential electrification of the vehicle fleet along with mandated increases in use of renewable fuels discussed above could result in decreasing demand for petroleum fuels which in turn could materially affect profitability at our refineries to meet higher fuel efficiency and ghg emission standards for passenger vehicles automobile manufacturers are increasingly using technologies such as turbocharging direct injection and higher compression ratios that require high octane gasoline many auto manufactures have expressed a desire that only a highoctane grade of gasoline be allowed in order to maximize fuel efficiency rather than the three octane grades common now regulatory changes allowing only one highoctane grade or significant increases in market demand for highoctane fuel could result in a shift to highoctane ethanol blends containing    ethanol the need for capital expenditures at our refineries to increase octane or reduced demand for petroleum fuels which could materially affect profitability of our refineries we operate independent refineries which may not be able to withstand volatile market conditions compete on the basis of price or obtain sufficient quantities of crude oil in times of shortage to the same extent as integrated multinational oil companies we compete with a broad range of companies in our refining and petroleum product marketing operations many of these competitors are integrated multinational oil companies that are substantially larger than us because of their diversity integration of operations larger capitalization larger and more complex refineries and greater resources these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions relating to crude oil and refined product pricing to compete on the basis of price and to obtain crude oil in times of shortage we do not engage in petroleum exploration or production and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks certain of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production activities competitors that have their own crude oil production are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages if we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations decreases in commodity prices may lessen our borrowing capacities increase collateral requirements for derivative instruments or cause a writedown of inventory the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil refined petroleum product and blendstock inventories because these inventories are commodities we have no control over their changing market value for example reductions in the value of our inventories or accounts receivable as a result of lower commodity prices could result in a reduction in our borrowing base calculation under the tyler refinerys revolving credit facility and a reduction in the amount of financial resources available to meet the tyler and el dorado refineries credit requirements further if at any time our availability under the revolving credit facility falls below certain thresholds we may be required to take steps to reduce our utilization under the credit facility in addition changes in commodity prices may require us to utilize substantial amounts of cash to settle or cash collateralize some or all of our existing commodity hedges finally because our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value we would record a writedown of inventory and a noncash charge to cost of sales if the market value of the inventory were to decline to an amount below our cost a terrorist attack on our assets or threats of war or actual war may hinder or prevent us from conducting our business terrorist attacks including cyberattacks in the united states as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them including political instability in various middle eastern countries may harm our business energyrelated assets which could include refineries pipelines and terminals such as ours may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states a direct attack on our assets or the assets of others used by us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any terrorist attack or continued political instability in the middle east could have an adverse impact on energy prices including prices for crude oil other feedstocks and refined petroleum products and an adverse impact on the margins from our refining and petroleum product marketing operations disruption or significant increases in energy prices could also result in governmentimposed price controls  legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and ghg emissions could increase our operating costs or decrease demand for our refined products various legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of discussion or implementation and could affect our operations they include proposed and recently enacted federal regulation and state actions to develop statewide regional or nationwide programs designed to control and reduce ghg emissions from fixed sources such as our refineries coalfired power plants and oil and gas production operations as well as mobile transportation sources and fuels many states and regions have implemented or are in the process of implementing measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through cap and trade programs or low carbon fuel standards but we do not currently operate in states that have their own ghg reduction programs on an international level in april  the united states became a signatory to the  paris un climate change conference agreement the paris climate agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels the paris climate agreement requires participating countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions to ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in  the paris climate agreement does not legally require parties to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but the uss future activities in response to the paris climate agreement may result in regulations to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions although it is not possible to predict the requirements of any ghg legislation that may be enacted any laws or regulations that have been or may be adopted to restrict or reduce ghg emissions will likely require us to incur increased operating and capital costs andor increased taxes on ghg emissions and petroleum fuels and result in reduced demand for our petroleum fuels if we are unable to maintain sales of our refined products at a price that reflects such increased costs there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further any increase in the prices of refined products resulting from such increased costs ghg cap and trade programs or taxes on ghgs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ghg regulation including taxes on the ghg content of fuels could also impact the consumption of refined products thereby affecting our refinery operations risks relating to our business we are particularly vulnerable to disruptions to our refining operations because our refining operations are concentrated in two facilities because all of our refining operations are concentrated in the tyler and el dorado refineries significant disruptions at either facility could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations refining segment contribution margin comprised approximately    and  of our consolidated contribution margin for the    and  fiscal years respectively our refineries consist of many processing units a number of which have been in operation for many years these processing units undergo periodic shutdowns known as turnarounds during which routine maintenance is performed to restore the operation of the equipment to its former level of performance depending on which units are affected all or a portion of a refinerys production may be halted or disrupted during a maintenance turnaround we completed maintenance turnarounds at our el dorado refinery in  and our tyler refinery in  in addition even if properly maintained equipment may require significant capital expenditures to maintain desired efficiencies one or more of the units may require additional unscheduled down time for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds refinery operations may also be disrupted by external factors such as a suspension of feedstock deliveries or an interruption of electricity natural gas water treatment or other utilities other potentially disruptive factors discussed elsewhere in these risk factors include natural disasters severe weather conditions workplace or environmental accidents interruptions of supply work stoppages losses of permits or authorizations or acts of terrorism disruptions to our refining operations could reduce our revenues during the period of time that our processing units are not operating the dangers inherent in transporting storing and processing crude oil and intermediate and finished petroleum products could cause disruptions and expose us to potentially significant costs and liabilities our refining and logistics operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in transporting storing and processing crude oil and intermediate and finished petroleum products these hazards and risks include but are not limited to natural or weatherrelated disasters fires explosions pipeline ruptures and spills trucking accidents train derailments thirdparty interference mechanical failure of equipment and other events beyond our control the occurrence of any of these events could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions personal injury or death environmental pollution and other damage to our properties and the properties of others for example we have experienced several crude oil releases from pipelines owned by our logistics segment each of these releases resulted in the need for cleanup and remediation efforts  because of these inherent dangers our refining and logistics operations are subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety process and operating safety environmental protection and transportation safety continued efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations related to health safety and the environment or a finding of noncompliance with current regulations could result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses as well as fines and penalties in addition our refineries pipelines and terminals are located in populated areas and any release of hazardous material or catastrophic event could affect our employees and contractors as well as persons outside our property our pipelines trucks and rail cars carry flammable and toxic materials on public railways and roads and across populated andor environmentally sensitive areas and waterways that could be severely impacted in the event of a release an accident could result in significant personal injuries andor cause a release that results in damage to occupied areas as well as damage to natural resources it could also affect deliveries of crude oil to our refineries resulting in a curtailment of operations the costs to remediate such an accidental release and address other potential liabilities as well as the costs associated with any interruption of operations could be substantial although we maintain significant insurance coverage for such events it may not cover all potential losses or liabilities in the event that personal injuries or deaths result from such events or there are natural resource damages we would likely incur substantial legal costs and liabilities the extent of these costs and liabilities could exceed the limits of our available insurance as a result any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows the costs scope timelines and benefits of our refining projects may deviate significantly from our original plans and estimates we may experience unanticipated increases in the cost scope and completion time for our improvement maintenance and repair projects at our refineries refinery projects are generally initiated to increase the yields of highervalue products increase our ability to process a variety of crude oils increase production capacity meet new regulatory requirements or maintain the safe and reliable operations of our existing assets equipment that we require to complete these projects may be unavailable to us at expected costs or within expected time periods additionally employee or contractor labor expense may exceed our expectations due to these or other factors beyond our control we may be unable to complete these projects within anticipated cost parameters and timelines in addition the benefits we realize from completed projects may take longer to achieve andor be less than we anticipated largescale capital projects are typically undertaken in anticipation of achieving an acceptable level of return on the capital to be employed in the project we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions that are not within our control most largescale projects take many years to complete and during this multiyear period market and other business conditions can change from those we forecast our inability to complete andor realize the benefits of refinery projects in a costefficient and timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we depend upon our logistics segment for a substantial portion of the crude oil supply and refined product distribution networks that serve our refineries our logistics segment consists of delek logistics a publicly traded master limited partnership and our consolidated financial statements include its consolidated financial results as of december    we owned a  limited partner interest in delek logistics and a  interest in logistics gp which owns the entire  general partner interest in delek logistics delek logistics operates a system of crude oil and refined product pipelines distribution terminals and tankage in arkansas louisiana tennessee and texas delek logistics generates revenues by charging tariffs for transporting crude oil and refined products through its pipelines by leasing pipeline capacity to third parties by charging fees for terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons and storing and providing other services at its terminals our refineries are substantially dependent upon delek logistics assets and services under several longterm pipeline and terminal tankage and throughput agreements expiring in  through  delek logistics is subject to its own operating and regulatory risks including but not limited to • its reliance on significant customers including us • macroeconomic factors such as commodity price volatility that could affect its customers utilization of its assets • its reliance on us for nearterm growth • sufficiency of cash flow for required distributions • counterparty risks such as creditworthiness and force majeure • competition from thirdparty pipelines and terminals and other competitors in the transportation and marketing industries • environmental regulations • operational hazards and risks • pipeline tariff regulations • limitations on additional borrowings and other restrictions in its debt agreements and  • other financial operational and legal risks the occurrence of any of these risks could directly or indirectly affect delek logistics financial condition results of operations and cash flows because delek logistics is our consolidated subsidiary the occurrence of any of these risks could also affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally if any of these risks affect delek logistics viability its ability to serve our supply and distribution needs may be jeopardized for additional information about delek logistics see logistics segment under item    business and properties of this annual report on form k interruptions or limitations in the supply and delivery of crude oil or the supply and distribution of refined products may negatively affect our refining operations and inhibit the growth of our refining operations we rely on delek logistics and thirdparty transportation systems for the delivery of crude oil to our refineries for example during the year ended december    we relied upon the west texas gulf pipeline for the delivery of approximately  of the crude oil processed by our refineries we could experience an interruption or reduction of supply and delivery or an increased cost of receiving crude oil if the ability of these systems to transport crude oil is disrupted because of accidents adverse weather conditions governmental regulation terrorism maintenance or failure of pipelines or other delivery systems other thirdparty action or other events beyond our control the unavailability for our use for a prolonged period of time of any system of delivery of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for example on two separate occasions since we assumed control of the el dorado refinery in april  a thirdparty pipeline operator has temporarily suspended crude oil shipments on a pipeline system that has historically supplied significant amounts of crude oil to the refinery in may  the suspension resulted from flooding along the mississippi river and lasted approximately five weeks in april  the suspension resulted from a pipeline rupture and lasted approximately ten months pipeline suspensions like these could require us to operate at reduced throughput rates moreover interruptions in delivery or limitations in delivery capacity may not allow our refining operations to draw sufficient crude oil to support current refinery production or increases in refining output in order to maintain or materially increase refining output existing crude delivery systems may require upgrades or supplementation which may require substantial additional capital expenditures in addition the el dorado refinery distributes most of its light product production through a thirdparty pipeline system an interruption to or change in the operation of the thirdparty pipeline system may result in a material restriction to our distribution channels because demand in the el dorado market is limited a material restriction to the el dorado refinerys distribution channels may cause us to reduce production and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations finally our west texas terminals sell refined products produced by refineries owned mostly by third parties in   these terminals received a majority of their supply of refined products from a single supplier we could experience an interruption or reduction of supply or delivery of refined products if our suppliers partially or completely ceased operations temporarily or permanently the ability of these refineries and our suppliers to supply refined products to us could be temporarily disrupted by anticipated events such as scheduled upgrades or maintenance as well as events beyond their control such as unscheduled maintenance fires floods storms explosions power outages accidents acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events labor difficulties and work stoppages governmental or private party litigation or legislation or regulation that adversely impacts refinery operations in addition any reduction in capacity of other pipelines that connect with our suppliers pipelines or our pipelines due to testing line repair reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced volumes of refined product supplied to our west texas terminals a reduction in the volume of refined products supplied to our west texas terminals could adversely affect our sales and earnings general economic conditions may adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition economic slowdowns may have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results because our performance is subject to domestic economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending some of the factors affecting consumer spending include general economic conditions unemployment consumer debt reductions in net worth based on declines in equity markets and residential real estate values adverse developments in mortgage markets taxation energy prices interest rates consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors during a period of economic weakness or uncertainty current or potential customers may travel less reduce or defer purchases go out of business or have insufficient funds to buy or pay for our products and services moreover a financial market crisis may have a material adverse impact on financial institutions and limit access to capital and credit this could among other things make it more difficult for us to obtain or increase our cost of obtaining capital and financing for our operations our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all also because both of our refineries are located in the gulf coast region we primarily market our refined products in a relatively limited geographic area as a result we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions compared to our more geographically diversified competitors  and any unforeseen events or circumstances that affect the gulf coast region could also materially and adversely affect our revenues and cash flows the primary factors include among other things changes in the economy weather conditions demographics and population increased supply of refined products from competitors and reductions in the supply of crude oil or other feedstocks in the event of a shift in the supplydemand balance in the gulf coast region due to changes in the local economy an increase in aggregate refining capacity or other reasons resulting in supply exceeding the demand in the region our refineries may have to deliver refined products to more customers outside of the gulf coast region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs resulting in lower refining margins if any from time to time our cash and credit needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and available credit and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to obtain the necessary cash or credit from financing sources we have significant shortterm cash needs to satisfy working capital requirements such as crude oil purchases which fluctuate with the pricing and sourcing of crude oil we rely in part on our access to credit to purchase crude oil for our refineries if the price of crude oil increases significantly we may not have sufficient available credit and may not be able to sufficiently increase such availability under our existing credit facilities or other arrangements to purchase enough crude oil to operate our refineries at desired capacities our failure to operate our refineries at desired capacities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also have significant longterm needs for cash including any capital expenditures for refinery expansion and upgrade projects as well as projects necessary for regulatory compliance depending on the conditions in credit markets it may become more difficult to obtain cash or credit from thirdparty sources if we cannot generate cash flow or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our shortterm and longterm capital requirements we may not be able to comply with regulatory deadlines or pursue our business strategies in which case our operations may not perform as well as we currently expect our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities as of december    we had total debt of  million  including current maturities of  million  in addition to our outstanding debt as of december    our letters of credit issued under our various credit facilities were  million  our borrowing availability under our various credit facilities as of december   was  million  our level of debt could have important consequences for us for example it could • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt and lease obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate • place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less indebtedness or better access to capital by for example limiting our ability to enter into new markets upgrade our refining assets or pursue acquisitions or other business opportunities • limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and • increase interest costs for our borrowed funds and letters of credit in addition a substantial portion of our debt has a variable rate of interest which increases our exposure to interest rate fluctuations to the extent we elect not to hedge such exposures if we are unable to meet our principal and interest obligations under our debt and lease agreements we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations seek additional equity financing or sell assets which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all our default on any of those agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify our debt agreements contain operating and financial restrictions that might constrain our business and financing activities the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in expand or pursue our business activities for example to varying degrees our credit facilities restrict our ability to • declare dividends and redeem or repurchase capital stock • prepay redeem or repurchase debt • make loans and investments issue guaranties and pledge assets • incur additional indebtedness or amend our debt and other material agreements • make capital expenditures • engage in mergers acquisitions and asset sales and  • enter into certain intercompany arrangements or make certain intercompany payments which in some instances could restrict our ability to use the assets cash flows or earnings of one operating segment to support another operating segment or holdings other restrictive covenants require that we meet certain financial covenants including leverage coverage fixed charge coverage and net worth tests as described in the applicable credit agreements in addition the covenant requirements of our various credit agreements require us to make many subjective determinations pertaining to our compliance thereto and exercise good faith judgment in determining our compliance our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our debt instruments may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions if market or other economic conditions deteriorate our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be impaired if we breach any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and our lenders commitments to make further loans to us may terminate we might not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these immediate payments in addition our obligations under our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets if we are unable to timely repay our obligations under our credit facilities the lenders could seek to foreclose on the assets or we may be required to contribute additional capital to our subsidiaries any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in our credit profile could affect our relationships with our suppliers which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to operate our refineries at full capacity changes in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil feedstock and refined product suppliers view our ability to make payments as a result suppliers could shorten the payment terms of their invoices with us or require us to provide significant collateral to them that we do not currently provide due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other petroleum product purchases as well as the historical volatility of crude oil pricing any imposition by our suppliers of more burdensome payment terms or collateral requirements may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers this in turn could cause us to be unable to operate our refineries at desired capacities a failure to operate our refineries at desired capacities could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows the termination or expiration of our amended and restated master supply and offtake agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity our so agreement with j aron expires on april   pursuant to the agreement j aron purchases a substantial portion of the crude oil and refined products in lion oil’s inventory at market prices upon any termination of the agreement including at expiration or in connection with a force majeure or default the parties are required to negotiate with third parties for the assignment to us of certain contracts commitments and arrangements including procurement contracts commitments for the sale of product and pipeline terminalling storage and shipping arrangements additionally upon any termination we will be required to repurchase or refinance the consigned crude oil and refined products from j aron at then market prices which may have a material impact on our working capital needs at december    we had approximately  million barrels of inventory consigned to j aron and we had recorded a liability associated with this consigned inventory of  million  our insurance policies do not cover all losses costs or liabilities that we may experience and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums we carry property business interruption pollution and casualty insurance but we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses costs or liabilities we could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage in addition we purchase insurance programs with large selfinsured retentions and large deductibles for example we retain a short period of our business interruption losses therefore a significant part or all of a business interruption loss or other types of loss could be retained by us the occurrence of a loss that is retained by us or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the energy industry is highly capital intensive and the entire or partial loss of individual facilities or multiple facilities can result in significant costs to both industry companies such as us and their insurance carriers historically large energy industry claims have resulted in significant increases in the level of premium costs and deductible periods for participants in the energy industry for example hurricanes have caused significant damage to energy companies operating along the gulf coast in addition to numerous oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in that region insurance companies that have historically participated in underwriting energyrelated risks may discontinue that practice may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or demand significantly higher premiums or deductible periods to cover these risks if significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur or if other adverse conditions over which we have no control prevail in the insurance market we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at reasonable cost  in addition we cannot assure you that our insurers will renew our insurance coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of nonrenewal the unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to successfully execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions a significant part of our growth strategy is to acquire assets such as refineries pipelines and terminals that complement our existing assets andor broaden our geographic presence if attractive opportunities arise we may also acquire assets in new lines of business that are complementary to our existing businesses from our inception in  through december   we acquired the tyler and el dorado refineries developed our logistics segment through the acquisition of transportation and marketing assets and purchased approximately  of the issued and outstanding common stock of alon usa we expect to continue to acquire assets that complement our existing assets andor broaden our geographic presence as a major element of our growth strategy however the occurrence of any of the following factors could adversely affect our growth strategy • we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional assets on favorable terms • we usually compete with others to acquire assets which competition may increase and any level of competition could result in decreased availability or increased prices for acquisition candidates • we may experience difficulty in anticipating the timing and availability of acquisition candidates • we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on favorable terms or at all to finance any of our potential acquisitions and • as a public company we are subject to reporting obligations internal controls and other accounting requirements with respect to any business we acquire which may prevent or negatively affect the valuation of some acquisitions we might otherwise deem favorable or increase our acquisition costs acquisitions involve risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ adversely compared with our expectations due to our emphasis on growth through acquisitions we are particularly susceptible to transactional risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ adversely compared with our expectations for example • during the acquisition process we may fail or be unable to discover some of the liabilities of companies or businesses that we acquire • we may assume contracts or other obligations in connection with particular acquisitions on terms that are less favorable or desirable than the terms that we would expect to obtain if we negotiated the contracts or other obligations directly • we may fail to successfully integrate or manage acquired assets • acquired assets may not perform as we expect or we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and financial improvements we anticipate • acquisitions may require us to incur additional debt or issue additional equity • acquired assets may suffer a diminishment in fair value as a result of which we may need to record a writedown or impairment • we may fail to grow our existing systems financial controls information systems management resources and human resources in a manner that effectively supports our growth • to the extent that we acquire assets in new lines of business we may become subject to additional regulatory requirements and additional risks that are characteristic or typical of these lines of business and • to the extent that we acquire equity interests in entities that control assets rather than acquiring the assets directly we may become subject to liabilities that predate our ownership and control of the assets the occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations failure to complete or delays in completing the mergers may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the transactions and could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results the mergers are subject to a number of conditions beyond delek’s and alon usa’s control that may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect their completion we cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied there can be no assurance that either delek or alon usa or both parties will waive any condition to closing that is not satisfied furthermore the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals and the time required to satisfy any other conditions to the closing could delay the completion of the mergers for a significant period of time or prevent the transaction from occurring any delay in completing the mergers could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the mergers are successfully completed within the expected timeframe in addition if the mergers are not completed by october   either delek or alon usa may choose not to proceed with the mergers and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the mergers before or after stockholder approval in addition delek or alon usa may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances  if the mergers are not completed our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks including the following • being required under certain circumstances to pay a termination fee of  million to alon usa • having to pay certain costs relating to the proposed mergers such as legal accounting financial advisor filing printing and mailing fees and • the focus of management on the mergers instead of our ongoing business operations or pursuing other opportunities that may be beneficial to delek if the mergers do not occur we may incur these costs without realizing any of the benefits of the mergers being completed in addition if the mergers are not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees we could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the mergers or to potential enforcement proceedings seeking to compel the performance of our obligations under the merger agreement there can be no assurance that the mergers will be completed within the expected timeframe or at all and the occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations pending litigation against delek or alon usa could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the mergers or a judgment requiring the payment of damages our directors and officers may be subject to lawsuits challenging the proposed mergers and other additional lawsuits that may be filed  the outcome of any such litigation is uncertain  if any litigation challenging the mergers is not resolved the lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the mergers and result in substantial costs to us including any costs associated with the indemnification of our directors and officers one condition to closing the mergers is that no order decree or injunction of any court or agency of competent jurisdiction be in effect that enjoins prohibits or makes illegal consummation of any of the transactions and no legal proceeding by any governmental authority with respect to the mergers or other transactions be pending that seeks to restrain enjoin prohibit or delay consummation of the mergers or imposes any material restrictions on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement accordingly any pending litigation with respect to the mergers will threaten to delay or prevent the closing of the mergers particularly if any plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the mergers additionally if the mergers are completed holdco would assume the risks and liabilities associated with litigation that alon usa and all members of the alon usa board are party to and we have agreed to indemnify the directors and officers of alon usa following the completion of the mergers for liability arising out of the fact that each such person was a director or officer of alon usa prior to the date of the merger agreement the defense or settlement of these legal proceedings and any future additional litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive divert the attention of our management away from their regular business and if the resolution of any one of these legal proceedings or any future litigation is adverse to us or otherwise threatens the consummation of the mergers could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of delek or the combined company if resolved after the mergers are completed the merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential acquiror of delek or could result in any potential acquisition proposal being offered at a lower price than might otherwise be offered the merger agreement contains “no shop” provisions that subject to limited exceptions restrict our ability to initiate solicit knowingly encourage or facilitate thirdparty proposals of offers to acquire all or a significant part of delek further even if our board withdraws or modifies its recommendation with respect to the issuance of holdco common stock to the stockholders of alon usa as consideration for the alon merger contemplated by the merger agreement it will still be required to submit the matter to a vote of our stockholders at the special meeting unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms in addition alon usa generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the merger agreement in response to any competing acquisition proposals as defined in the merger agreement that may be made before our board may withdraw or modify its recommendation in some circumstances upon termination of the merger agreement either of the parties to the merger agreement may be required to pay a termination fee to the other party these provisions could discourage a potential acquiror from considering or proposing an acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than that market value proposed to be received or realized in the mergers or might result in a potential acquiror proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances if we complete the mergers we may face risks in connection with our planned integration of alon usa    risks we face in connection with our planned integration of alon usa include but are not limited to    • the risk that the proposed transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of delek and alon usa to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers and customers and on their operating results and businesses generally   • the risk that problems may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the companies which may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected  • the risk that the combined company may be unable to achieve costcutting synergies or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies  • uncertainty related to timing and amount of future share repurchases and dividend payments  • risks and uncertainties with respect to the quantities and costs of crude oil we are able to obtain and the price of the refined petroleum products we ultimately sell  • gains and losses from derivative instruments   • managements ability to execute its strategy of growth through acquisitions and the transactional risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions   • acquired assets may suffer a diminishment in fair value as a result of which we may need to record a writedown or impairment in carrying value of the asset   • changes in the scope costs andor timing of capital and maintenance projects   • operating hazards inherent in transporting storing and processing crude oil and intermediate and finished petroleum products   • our competitive position and the effects of competition   • the projected growth of the industries in which we operate   • general economic and business conditions affecting the southern united states  and • other risks contained alon usa’s filings with the sec    the occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations    our sale of the retail entities to copec involves risks related to our continuing obligations under the purchase agreement and the effect of the disposition of the retail entities     in november  we closed the retail transaction pursuant to which we sold the retail entities to copec which comprised our retail segment and a portion of our corporate other and eliminations segment in connection with the closing of the retail transaction we and our stockholders are subject to several risks including the following    • the effect of the sale of the retail entities may adversely affect our relationships with our employees customers suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships   • any event that results in a right for copec to seek indemnity from us could result in a substantial payment from us to copec and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  • certain terms of the purchase agreement may preclude us from engaging in or pursuing certain business opportunities and   • our revenues will decrease accordingly and our business will be subject to an increased concentration of the risks that affect our refining and logistics segments  we may incur significant costs and liabilities with respect to investigation and remediation of environmental conditions at our refineries prior to our purchase of our refineries and terminals the previous owners had been engaged for many years in the investigation and remediation of hydrocarbons and other materials which contaminated soil and groundwater at the purchased facilities upon purchase of the facilities we became responsible and liable for certain costs associated with the continued investigation and remediation of known and unknown impacted areas at the refineries in the future it may be necessary to conduct further assessments and remediation efforts at impacted areas at our refinery pipeline tank terminal locations and elsewhere in addition we have identified and selfreported certain other environmental matters subsequent to our purchase of the refineries based upon environmental evaluations performed internally and by third parties subsequent to the purchase of our refineries and other properties we recorded and periodically update environmental liabilities and accrued amounts we believe are sufficient to complete remediation we expect remediation of soil sediment and groundwater at some properties to continue for the foreseeable future the need to make future expenditures for these purposes that exceed the amounts we estimated and accrued for could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the future we may incur substantial expenditures for investigation or remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at our current or former locations or locations that we may acquire in addition new legal requirements new interpretations of existing legal requirements increased legislative activity and governmental enforcement and other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated as material other than for assessments the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action  we could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health safety environmental and other laws and regulations our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations these authorizations and permits are subject to revocation renewal or modification and can require operational changes to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment andor health and safety a violation of authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines criminal sanctions permit revocations injunctions andor facility shutdowns in addition major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and cash flows our tyler refinery currently has limited ability to economically distribute refined petroleum products outside the northeast texas market in recent years we have expanded our refined product distribution capacities in northeast texas with our acquisition of refined product terminals located in big sandy texas and mount pleasant texas however unlike most other refineries the tyler refinery currently has a limited ability to distribute refined products outside the northeast texas market for the year ended december    nearly all of the refinery sales volume in tyler was completed through a rack system located at the tyler refinery which is owned by our logistics segment the tyler refinerys limited distribution capabilities may continue to limit its ability to increase its production attract new customers for its refined petroleum products or increase sales of the tyler refinery products in addition if demand for the tyler refinerys products diminishes within the northeast texas market its production may be reduced and our financial results would be adversely affected unless additional distribution capabilities are identified an increase in competition andor reduction in demand in the markets in which we purchase feedstocks and sell our refined products could increase our costs andor lower prices and adversely affect our sales and profitability our tyler refinery is currently the only supplier of a full range of refined petroleum products within a radius of approximately  miles of its location and there are no competitive fuel loading terminals within approximately  miles of our san angelo terminal if competitors commence operations within these niche markets we could lose our niche market advantage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our el dorado refinerys profitability may be impacted by increased competition from refineries that operate in different regions that have access to canadian and domestic crudes which from time to time may be discounted from crudes available to our el dorado refinery for example thirdparty pipelines are currently in operation and have increased the supply of thirdparty refined products in little rock arkansas in addition the maintenance or replacement of our existing customers depends on a number of factors outside of our control including increased competition from other suppliers and demand for refined products in the markets we serve the market for distribution of wholesale motor fuel is highly competitive and fragmented some of our competitors have significantly greater resources and name recognition than us the loss of major customers or a reduction in amounts purchased by major customers could have an adverse effect on us to the extent that we are not able to correspondingly increase sales to other purchasers compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future certain of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority which could increase or otherwise alter our tax liabilities subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may also subject us to interest and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example the tax treatment of our logistics segment depends on its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if a change in law our failure to comply with existing law or other factors were to cause our logistics segment to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes it would become subject to entitylevel taxation as a result our logistics segment would pay federal income tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates subject to corporate alternative minimum tax would likely pay additional state and local income taxes at varying rates and distributions to unitholders including us would be generally treated as taxable dividends from a corporation in such case the logistics segment would likely experience a material reduction in its anticipated cash flow and aftertax return to its unitholders and we would likely experience a substantial reduction in its value in addition recent regulatory proposals in the united states could effectively limit or even eliminate use of the lifo inventory method for financial and income tax purposes although the final outcome of these proposals cannot be ascertained at this time the ultimate impact to us of the transition from lifo to another inventory method could be material we use the lifo method with respect to our inventories at the tyler  refinery a change to the fifo inventory method could result in a material increasedecrease in the tax basis of our inventory at the tyler refinery this increasedecrease in inventory value could impact our taxable income in the year of change or ratably over several tax years our commodity and interest rate derivative activity may limit potential gains increase potential losses result in earnings volatility and involve other risks at times we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions future purchases of crude oil ethanol and other feedstocks future sales of refined products manage our rins exposure or to secure margins on future production we have used interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our market exposure to changes in interest rates related to our floating rate borrowings we expect to continue to enter into these types of transactions from time to time and have increased our use of these risk management activities in recent years while these transactions are intended to limit our exposure to the adverse effects of fluctuations in crude oil prices refined products prices rin prices and interest rates they may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in market conditions and may subject us to periodbyperiod earnings volatility in the instances where we do not seek hedge accounting for these transactions further because the volume of derivative activity is less than our actual use of crude oil production of refined products or total rins exposure our risk management activity does not completely limit our exposure to market volatility also in connection with such derivative transactions we may be required to make cash payments to maintain margin accounts and to settle the contracts at their value upon termination finally this activity exposes us to potential risk of counterparties to our derivative contracts failing to perform under the contracts as a result the effectiveness of our risk management policies could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and cash flows for additional information about the nature and volume of these transactions see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this annual report on form k we are exposed to certain counterparty risks which may adversely impact our results of operations we evaluate the creditworthiness of each of our various counterparties but we may not always be able to fully anticipate or detect deterioration in a counterpartys creditworthiness and overall financial condition the deterioration of creditworthiness or overall financial condition of a material counterparty or counterparties could expose us to an increased risk of nonpayment or other default under our contracts with them if a material counterparty or counterparties defaults on their obligations to us this could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows for example under the terms of the so agreement with j aron we granted j aron the exclusive right to store and withdraw crude and certain products in the tanks associated with the el dorado refinery the so agreement also provides that the ownership of substantially all crude oil and certain other refined products in the tanks associated with the refinery will be retained by j aron and that j aron will purchase substantially all of the specified refined products processed at the el dorado refinery an adverse change in j arons business results of operations liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect its ability to timely discharge its obligations to us which could consequently have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or liquidity adverse weather conditions or other unforeseen developments could damage our facilities and impair our ability to produce and deliver refined petroleum products the regions in which we operate are susceptible to severe storms including hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes floods extended periods of rain ice storms and snow all of which we have experienced in the past few years in addition for a variety of reasons many members of the scientific community believe that climate changes are occurring that could have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations inclement weather conditions could damage our facilities interrupt production adversely impact consumer behavior travel and retail fuel demand or interrupt or impede our ability to operate our locations if such conditions prevail near our refineries they could interrupt or undermine our ability to produce and transport products from our refineries and receive and distribute products at our terminals regional occurrences such as energy shortages or increases in energy prices fires and other natural disasters could also hurt our business the occurrence of any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our operating results are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year for our refining and logistics segments we depend on favorable weather conditions in the spring and summer months demand for gasoline and asphalt products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in motor vehicle traffic and road and home construction varying vapor pressure requirements between the summer and winter months also tighten summer gasoline supply as a result the operating results of our refining segment and logistics segment are generally lower for the first and fourth quarters of each year  a substantial portion of the workforce at our refineries is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations as of december    we employed  and  people in our tyler and el dorado operations respectively from among these employees  operations and maintenance hourly employees and  truck drivers at the tyler refinery were represented by the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union and its local  at year end the tyler operations and maintenance hourly employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires january    the tyler truck drivers are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires march    as of december     operations and maintenance hourly employees at the el dorado refinery were represented by the international union of operating engineers and its local  these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expires on august    although these collective bargaining agreements contain provisions to discourage strikes or work stoppages we cannot assure you that strikes or work stoppages will not occur a strike or work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business we rely on information technology systems across our operations including management of our supply chain including various processes and transactions we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information any compromise or breach of our internal data network at any of our refining or terminal locations could cause interruptions in our operations these disruptions could range from inconvenience in accessing business information to a disruption in our refining andor logistics operations the landscape of cyber threats is continuously changing and we combat this threat by undertaking continuous improvement opportunities within our security systems cost increases may be incurred in this area to combat the continued escalation of cyber attacks andor disruptive criminal activity also we utilize information technology systems and controls that monitor the movement of petroleum products through our pipelines and terminals an undetected failure of these systems could result in environmental damage operational disruptions regulatory enforcement or private litigation further the failure of any of our systems to operate effectively or problems we may experience with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could significantly harm our business and operations and cause us to incur significant costs to remediate such problems if we lose any of our key personnel our ability to manage our business and continue our growth could be negatively impacted our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and key technical personnel we do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies for any of our senior management team the loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key technical employee could significantly harm us we face competition for these professionals from our competitors our customers and other companies operating in our industry to the extent that the services of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel would be unavailable to us for any reason we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our company and to develop our products and technology we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all if we are or become a united states real property holding corporation special tax rules may apply to a sale exchange or other disposition of common stock and nonus holders may be less inclined to invest in our stock as they may be subject to united states federal income tax in certain situations a nonus holder of our common stock may be subject to united states federal income tax with respect to gain recognized on the sale exchange or other disposition of our common stock if we are or were a us real property holding corporation usrphc at any time during the shorter of the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or other disposition and the period such nonus holder held our common stock the shorter period referred to as the lookback period in general we would be a usrphc if the fair market value of our us real property interests as such term is defined for united states federal income tax purposes equals or exceeds  of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests and our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business the test for determining usrphc status is applied on certain specific determination dates and is dependent upon a number of factors some of which are beyond our control including for example fluctuations in the value of our assets if we are or become a usrphc so long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market such as the nyse only a nonus holder who actually or constructively holds or held during the lookback period more than five percent of our common stock will be subject to united states federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock  risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which may be beyond our control including • our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry • inaccuracies in and changes to our previously published quarterly or annual earnings • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • economic conditions within our industry as well as general economic and stock market conditions • the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or the cessation of such coverage • changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and the frequency and accuracy of such reports • future issuance or sales of our common stock • announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • sales of common stock by our senior officers or our affiliates and • the other factors described in these risk factors in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes often occur without any apparent regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company performance and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price in addition recent distress in the credit and financial markets resulted in extreme volatility in trading prices of securities and diminished liquidity and we cannot assure you that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy in the past some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them the filing of a lawsuit against us regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources we do not have the ability to control the operations or policies of alon usa for so long as we do not control a majority of alon usa common stock as of december    we owned approximately  of the issued and outstanding common stock of alon usa the “alon investment” and five of our employees served on the member alon usa board of directors including mr yemin who serves as the chairman of the alon usa board of directors however as a result of our minority ownership position in alon usa common stock and our minority position on the alon usa board of directors we are unable to control the operations or policies of alon usa so long as we maintain a minority ownership position in alon usa common stock and a minority position on the alon usa board of directors we may be unable to control among other things i the election of members of the alon usa board of directors ii the corporate and management policies of alon usa including the declaration of dividends and the timing and preparation of its financial statements andor iii the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to shareholders of alon usa for approval including potential mergers or acquisitions asset sales or other significant corporate transactions see note  of the consolidated financial statements included in item  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k for further information regarding a definitive agreement under which delek will acquire all of the outstanding shares of alon usa common stock which delek does not already own in an allstock transaction because we account for the alon investment under the equity method of accounting the earnings or losses reported by alon usa will have a direct effect upon our earnings due to our ownership percentage in alon usa we account for the alon investment using the equity method of accounting as a result the earnings or losses reported by alon usa will have a direct impact on our earnings or losses per share alon usa is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products subject to many of the same risk factors affecting us as described this annual report on form k as well as other risk factors to the extent that these factors adversely impact alon usa’s earnings our earnings per share would be adversely affected as well for example for the quarter ended december   alon usa reported a goodwill impairment in the amount of approximately  million that adversely impacted alon usas pretax earnings because we account for the alon investment using the equity method of accounting this impairment adversely impacted our pretax earnings for the quarter ended december   by approximately  million for additional information regarding the risks to alon usas business please see those identified in alon usas annual quarterly and current reports including those identified in alon usas annual report on form k for the year ended december    stockholder activism may negatively impact the price of our common stock our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over us the alon investment and recent decline in the price of our common stock increase this risk campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies as a result stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows future sales of shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the introduction of a large number of shares of our common stock into the market or the perception that these sales could occur for example we issued six million shares of our common stock to alon israel oil company ltd in connection with the alon investment and upon the closing of the proposed merger with alon usa a significant number of shares of holdco common stock would be issued to the stockholders of alon usa in consideration for their alon usa shares the introduction of these shares into the market or the perception that sales of these shares could occur could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate our stockholders may suffer substantial dilution we may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable even if we do not have an immediate need for capital in addition if we have an immediate need for capital we may sell securities in the public or private equity markets even when conditions are not otherwise favorable our stockholders will suffer dilution if we issue currently unissued shares of our stock or sell our treasury holdings in the future our stockholders will also suffer dilution as stock restricted stock units stock options stock appreciation rights warrants or other equity awards whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted are exercised we depend upon our subsidiaries for cash to meet our obligations and pay any dividends we are a holding company our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets consequently our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or pay dividends to our stockholders depend upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends tax sharing payments or otherwise our subsidiaries ability to make any payments will depend on many factors including their earnings cash flows the terms of their credit facilities tax considerations and legal restrictions we may be unable to pay future regular dividends in the anticipated amounts and frequency set forth herein we will only be able to pay regular dividends from our available cash on hand and funds received from our subsidiaries our ability to receive dividends and other cash payments from our subsidiaries is restricted under the terms of their respective credit facilities for example under the terms of their credit facilities our subsidiaries are subject to certain customary covenants that limit their ability to subject to certain exceptions as defined in their respective credit agreements remit cash to distribute assets to or make investments in us as the parent company specifically these covenants limit the payment in the form of cash or other assets of dividends or other cash payments to us the declaration of future regular dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our results of operations financial condition earnings capital requirements restrictions in our debt agreements and legal requirements although we currently intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at an annual rate of  per share we cannot provide any assurances that any regular dividends will be paid in the anticipated amounts and frequency set forth herein if at all provisions of delaware law and our organizational documents may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders may consider in their best interests which could negatively affect our stock price provisions of delaware law our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our third amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or deterring tender offers for our common stock that other stockholders may consider in their best interests for example our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that • stockholder actions may only be taken at annual or special meetings of stockholders • members of our board of directors can be removed with or without cause by a supermajority vote of stockholders • the court of chancery of the state of delaware is with certain exceptions the exclusive forum for certain legal actions • our bylaws as may be in effect from time to time can be amended only by a supermajority vote of stockholders and  • certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation as may be in effect from time to time can be amended only by a supermajority vote of stockholders in addition the certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms to be fixed by our board of directors stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive for a person or group to acquire control of us and could effectively be used as an antitakeover device on the date of this report no shares of our preferred stock are outstanding finally our third amended and restated bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate director candidates for election or to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders and require that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chairman of the board of directors president or secretary after written request of a majority of our board of directors the advance notice provision requires disclosure of derivative positions hedging transactions short interests rights to dividends and other similar positions of any stockholder proposing a director nomination in order to promote full disclosure of such stockholders economic interest in us the antitakeover provisions of delaware law and provisions in our organizational documents may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future we are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of internal controls required by section  of sarbanesoxley to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section  of sarbanesoxley we are required to evaluate our internal controls systems to allow management to report on and our independent auditors to audit our internal controls over financial reporting during this process we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable sec and public company accounting oversight board rules and regulations that remain unremediated as a public company we are required to report among other things control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal controls that or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal controls over financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis if we fail to comply with the requirements of section  we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec or the nyse additionally failure to comply with section  or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may be adversely affected if we fail to remedy any material weakness our financial statements may be inaccurate we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may decline item b     unresolved staff

an integrated downstream energy business focused on petroleum refining and the transportation storage and wholesale distribution of crude oil intermediate and refined products and prior to august  convenience store retailing prior to august  we aggregated our operating units into three reportable segments refining logistics and retail however in august  we entered into a definitive equity purchase agreement the purchase agreement with copec under the terms of the purchase agreement delek agreed to sell and copec agreed to purchase  of the equity interests in deleks whollyowned subsidiaries mapco express inc mapco fleet inc delek transportation llc nti investments llc and gdk bearpaw llc collectively the “retail entities” for cash consideration of  million subject to certain customary adjustments the “transaction” in november  the retail transaction closed as a result of the purchase agreement we met the requirements of asc  presentation of financial statements  discontinued operations and asc  property plant and equipment to report the results of the retail entities as discontinued operations and to classify the retail entities as a group of assets held for sale  we own a  limited partner interest in delek logistics partners lp delek logistics and a  interest in the entity that owns the entire  general partner interest in delek logistics and all of the income distribution rights d elek logistics was formed by delek in  to own operate acquire and construct crude oil and refined products logistics and marketing assets delek logistics initial assets were contributed by us and included certain assets formerly owned or used by certain of our subsidiaries a substantial majority of delek logistics assets are currently integral to our refining and marketing operations our profitability in the refining segment is substantially determined by the difference between the cost of the crude oil feedstocks we purchase and the price of the refined products we sell referred to as the crack spread refining margin or refined product margin the cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined petroleum products we ultimately sell from our refineries depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline and other refined petroleum products which in turn depend on among other factors changes in domestic and foreign economies weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes local domestic and foreign political affairs global conflict production levels the availability of imports the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation other significant factors that influence our results in the refining segment include operating costs particularly the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity seasonal factors refinery utilization rates and planned or unplanned maintenance activities or turnarounds moreover while the fluctuations in the cost of crude oil typically influence the prices of light refined products such as gasoline and diesel fuel the price of other residual products such as asphalt coke carbon black oil and lpg are less likely to move in parallel with crude cost this causes additional pressure on our realized margin in periods of rising crude oil prices and during periods of falling crude oil prices margins may benefit from these economics additionally our margins are impacted by the pricing differentials of the various types and sources of crude oil we use at our two refineries and their relation to product pricing such as the differentials between midland wti and cushing wti or cushing wti and brent crude oil for our tyler refinery we compare our per barrel refined product margin to a wellestablished industry metric the gulf coast crack spread the gulf coast crack spread is used as a benchmark for measuring a refinerys product margins by measuring the difference between the market price of light products and crude oil it represents the approximate gross margin resulting from processing one barrel of crude oil into threefifths of a barrel of gasoline and twofifths of a barrel of highsulfur diesel we calculate the gulf coast crack spread using the market value of us gulf coast pipeline cbob and us gulf coast pipeline no  heating oil high sulfur diesel and the first month futures price of wti on the nymex us gulf coast pipeline cbob is a grade of gasoline commonly blended with biofuels and marketed as regular unleaded at retail locations us gulf coast pipeline no  heating oil is a petroleum distillate that can be used as either a diesel fuel or a fuel oil this is the standard by which other distillate products such as ultra low sulfur diesel are priced the nymex is the commodities trading exchange where contracts for the future delivery of petroleum products are bought and sold the crude oil and product slate flexibility of the el dorado refinery allows us to take advantage of changes in the crude oil and product markets therefore we anticipate that the quantities and varieties of crude oil processed and products manufactured at the el dorado refinery will continue to vary thus we do not believe that it is possible to develop a reasonable refined product margin benchmark that would accurately portray our refined product margins at the el dorado refinery the cost to acquire the refined fuel products we sell to our wholesale customers in our logistics segment depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline and other refined petroleum products which in turn depend on among other factors changes in domestic and foreign economies weather conditions domestic and foreign political affairs production levels the availability of imports the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation we also own a noncontrolling equity interest of approximately  of the outstanding shares the alj shares in alon usa energy inc nyse alj alon usa alon usa is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products operating primarily in the south central southwestern and western regions of the united states alon usa owns  of the general partner and  of the limited partner interests in alon usa partners lp nyse aldw which owns a crude oil refinery in big spring texas with a crude oil throughput capacity of  bpd and an integrated wholesale marketing business in addition alon usa directly owns a crude oil refinery in krotz springs louisiana with a crude oil throughput capacity of  bpd alon usa also owns crude oil refineries in california which have not processed crude oil since  alon usa is a marketer of asphalt which it distributes through asphalt terminals located predominately in the southwestern and western united states alon usa is the largest eleven licensee in the united states and operates approximately  convenience stores which market motor fuels in central and west texas and new mexico our investment in alon usa is accounted for as an equity method investment and the earnings from this equity method investment reflected in our consolidated statements of income include our share of net earnings directly attributable to this equity method investment and amortization of the excess of our investment balance over the underlying net assets of alon usa in january  we announced a definitive agreement under which delek will acquire all of the outstanding shares of alon usa common stock which delek does not already own in an allstock transaction see  strategic developments  alon merger below for further information due to the decline in the quoted market price of alon usa below the carrying amount of our investment we evaluated our investment in alon usa for potential impairment as of september   we determined that the decline in the market value of the alj shares is other than temporary and therefore it was necessary to record an impairment charge of  million on our investment in the year ended december    our decision that the decline in market value of the alj shares is other than temporary was primarily based on the following factors the duration of the period in which the fair market value had been below our investment balance and the decreased possibility of a recovery in the  near term as a result of alon usas recent financial performance as well as expectations of alon usas future operating performance future conditions in the industry operating performance and performance in relation to peers and the future economic environment may continue to decline such future conditions could cause us to determine that any further decline in fair value is also other than temporary if we determine that further decline is other than temporary we will record additional writedowns in the carrying value of our asset to the thencurrent fair market value as part of our overall business strategy we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our portfolio of businesses and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that if consummated could have a material effect on our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations  strategic goals • maintain and continue to enhance our safe operations as we invest in and grow our business we remain focused on operating safe and compliant operations for the benefit of our employees communities customers and our shareholders • successful completion and integration of the alon merger this transaction marks our next step in our growth we will be focused on the successful integration of the companies to capitalize on synergies utilize the expertise from both companies to apply best practices to improve the performance of a larger asset base and unlock logistics value from the refining assets • utilize our position in the permian basin a successful combination with alon will create a permian basin focused organization as it expands our refining logistics and retail presence in the area the combined refining system should have approximately  barrels per day of crude throughput capacity and access to approximately  barrels per day of permian basin sourced crude we believe our logistics assets are well positioned to support this larger refining system and we will gain a retail presence in west texas through the combination we intend to direct our efforts at exploring opportunities to utilize our permian basin position to create additional growth across our businesses • build on a winning culture in  our team implemented strategies across our operating platforms that improved our cost structure unlocked the value of our assets and managed our operations during a challenging refining environment  if we successfully complete the alon merger we will become a larger and more diverse company and our focus will be to foster a culture where we have the ability to act quickly in a changing environment to take advantage of opportunities the foundation of this effort is our focus on expanding our team developing systems and providing the resources to support a growing organization • focus on continued improvements in optimization of our refining system the market environment for refining is dynamic and we strive to improve the factors within our control to create long term value this includes a continued focus on reliability efficiencies and yields in our refining system to improve cost and aligning operations with commercial demand to maximize margins we believe this will enhance our competitive position and provide free cash flow potential as we grow we intend to apply this focus to a larger refining platform • enhance our logistics assets if we successfully complete the alon merger we will look for opportunities to capitalize on increased access to the permian basin to increase our crude gathering operations and grow our logistics assets to support our operations as well as third parties this will include continued development of our rio joint venture crude oil pipeline in the delaware basin in addition our focus will be to increase our product marketing capabilities in our logistics segment to support our growing refining system • grow through opportunistic acquisitions this growth platform has been a central part of the development of our integrated business model we will be focused on the successful completion and integration of the alon merger but we will continue to explore opportunities to provide longterm growth across our business platforms • use our financial flexibility and cash flow to create shareholder value we are focused on managing the cash flow in our business to support our capital allocation program that includes  investing in our business  growing through acquisitions and  returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  all of which support our central theme of increasing longterm value for our shareholders

by an increase in foreign exports fluctuations in the price of cushing wti crude oil impact the cost of raw materials processed at our refineries as well as the price of finished products sold by both of our operating segments  click to enlarge click to enlarge  our tyler and el dorado refineries both continue to have greater access to midland wti and midland wtilinked crude feedstocks compared to certain of our competitors a combination of the addition of new pipelines which have increased the ability to ship priceadvantaged crude oil supplies to and from the midcontinent region and a low crude oil price environment were factors in a decline in certain crude oil price differentials favorable to us as these price differentials decrease so does our competitive advantage created by our access to midland wtilinked crude oil the chart below illustrates the differentials of both brent crude oil and midland wti crude oil as compared to cushing wti crude oil click to enlarge  environmental regulations continue to affect our margins in the form of the increasing cost of rins  on a consolidated basis we work to balance our rins obligations in order to minimize the effect of rins on our results while we generate rins in both of our operating segments through our ethanol blending and biodiesel production our refining segment needs to purchase additional rins to satisfy its obligations as a result increases in the price of rins generally adversely affect our results of operations it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty what future volumes or costs may be but given the increase in required volumes and the volatile price of rins the cost of purchasing sufficient rins could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are unable to

and  per gallon respectively during the year ended december   compared to   volumes of gasoline and diesel sold in west texas decreased  million gallons and  million gallons respectively further contributing to the decrease were declines in fees on our paline pipeline system as a result of lower contractual volumes and declines in fuel surcharge revenues and lower asphalt hauling associated with our trucking assets partially offsetting the decreases were increased throughput at most of our terminals the majority of which occurred at our terminals in el dorado arkansas and tyler texas as operations matched commercial demand and the effects of the throughput and tankage agreements for the logistics assets pursuant to which we generated revenue on the logistics assets during all periods for the year ended december    with no comparable revenue earned during the first quarter of  also offsetting the decreases were increases in volumes and fees associated with the marketing agreement

december   compared to  million for the comparable period of   an decrease of  million  or   the decrease in operating expenses during the year ended december    compared to  was due to cost saving initiatives taken during   which resulted in decreases in maintenance costs and supplies expenses associated with our terminals including tanks at those terminals and the sala gathering system partially offsetting these decreases were increases in operating expenses related to internal tank contamination at one of our terminals and hydro testing on our paline pipeline operating expenses were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the comparable period of   an increase of  million  or   the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in

year ended december   was  million  or  of our consolidated contribution margin compared to  million  or  of our consolidated contribution margin for the year ended december    an increase of  million  or   the increase in contribution margin was primarily attributable to increased throughput at most of our terminals and increased fees associated with the logistics assets and marketing agreement as discussed above also contributing to the increase were improvements in our west texas wholesale marketing margin per barrel as a result of improving market conditions in the region our contribution margin in our west texas operations during the year ended december   was impacted by lower crude oil prices that reduced demand in the region and lowered throughput in our west texas operations partially offsetting the increases were declines in fees on our paline pipeline system and declines in fuel surcharge revenues and lower asphalt hauling associated with our trucking assets as

our trucking assets and the effects of the throughput and tankage agreements for the logistics assets as described above offsetting the increases were lower margins in our west texas operations the decrease in our contribution margin in our west texas operations was a result of a more challenging market in which lower crude oil prices drove a reduction in drilling activity in west texas lowering demand in the region also contributing to the decrease in our west texas margins was a decline in the average market price for ethanol to a level below our fixed price contracts that were in place during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   when average market prices were above our fixed priced contracts additionally our contribution margin in our west texas operations during the year ended december   benefited from a favorable supplydemand balance and downtime at refineries in the region  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity

arrangements through the date of this annual report on form k critical accounting policies and estimates the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap and in the process of applying these principles we must make judgments assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time to aid a readers understanding management has identified our critical accounting policies these policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time events which are continuous in nature actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events some over which we may have little or no control lifo inventory the tyler refinerys inventory consists of crude oil refined petroleum products and blendstocks which are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined under the lastin firstout lifo valuation method the lifo method requires management to make estimates on an interim basis of the anticipated yearend inventory quantities which could differ from actual quantities we believe the accounting estimate related to the establishment of anticipated yearend lifo inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future production rates in the tyler refinery the future buying patterns of our customers as well as numerous other factors beyond our control including the economic viability of the general economy weather conditions the availability of imports the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates could be material to the inventories reported on our quarterly balance sheets and the impact on the results reported in our quarterly statements of income could be material in selecting assumed inventory levels we use historical trending of production and sales recognition of current market indicators of future pricing and value and new regulatory requirements which might impact inventory levels managements assumptions require significant judgment because actual yearend inventory levels have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so at each yearend actual physical inventory levels are used to calculate both ending inventory balances and final cost of goods sold for the year  property plant and equipment and definite life intangibles impairment property plant and equipment and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset undiscounted and without interest charges we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans we use quoted market prices when available and our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine fair value as appropriate if the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset we recognized an impairment charge of  million in  related to the writedown of certain idle refining equipment in our refining segment to net realizable value this impairment charge is included in other operating income in our consolidated statement of income for the period there was no such impairment charge in  or   goodwill and potential impairment goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist goodwill is tested by comparing net book value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value in assessing the recoverability of goodwill assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit we use a market participant weighted average cost of capital estimated minimal growth rates for revenue gross profit and capital expenditures based on history and our best estimate of future forecasts we also estimate the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows such as those used by thirdparty analysts if these estimates and assumptions change in the future due to such factors as a decline in general economic conditions competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond managements control an impairment charge may be required our annual assessment of goodwill did not result in impairment during the years ended december     or   details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in note  to the consolidated financial statements in item  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k environmental liabilities it is our policy to accrue environmental and cleanup related costs of a noncapital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated environmental liabilities represent the current estimated costs to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties this estimate is based on internal and thirdparty assessments of the extent of the contamination the selected remediation technology and review of applicable environmental regulations accruals for estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and include but are not limited to costs to perform remedial actions and costs of machinery and equipment that is dedicated to the remedial actions and that does not have an alternative use such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change we discount environmental liabilities to their present value if payments are fixed and determinable expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized changes in laws and regulations and actual remediation expenses compared to historical experience could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position we believe the estimates selected in each instance represent our best estimate of future outcomes but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected new accounting pronouncements see note  to the consolidated financial statements in item  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to us  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in commodity prices mainly crude oil and unleaded gasoline and interest rates are our primary sources of market risk when we make the decision to manage our market exposure our objective is generally to avoid losses from adverse price changes realizing we will not obtain the gains of beneficial price changes commodity price risk impact of changing prices our revenues and cash flows as well as estimates of future cash flows are sensitive to changes in energy prices major shifts in the cost of crude oil the prices of refined products and the cost of ethanol can generate large changes in the operating margin in each of our segments we maintain at both companyowned and thirdparty facilities inventories of crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products the values of which are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by world economic conditions regional and global inventory levels and seasonal conditions at december   and   we held approximately  million and  million barrels respectively of crude and product inventories associated with the tyler refinery valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of  and  per barrel respectively at december   and   the excess of replacement cost fifo over the carrying value lifo of refinery inventories was  million and  million  respectively we refer to this excess as our lifo reserve at december   and   we held approximately  million and  million barrels respectively of crude and product inventories associated with the el dorado refinery valued under the fifo valuation method with an average cost of  and  per barrel respectively due to a lower crude oil and refined product pricing environment experienced since the end of  market prices have declined to a level below the average cost of our inventories at december    we recorded a pretax lower of cost or market reserve of  million  all of which related to lifo inventory which is subject to reversal in subsequent periods not to exceed lifo cost should market prices recover at december    we recorded a pretax lower of cost or market reserve of  million  of which  million related to lifo inventory which reversed in the first quarter of  as the inventories associated with the valuation adjustment at the end of  were sold or used for the years ended december     and   we recognized net lower of cost or market gains charges of  million   million and  million  respectively which were recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income price risk management activities at times we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions future purchases of crude oil and ethanol future sales of refined products or to fix margins on future production we also enter into future commitments to purchase or sell rins at fixed prices and quantities which are used to manage the costs associated with our rins obligations these future rin commitments meet the definition of derivative instruments under asc  derivatives and hedging asc  in accordance with asc  all of these commodity contracts and future purchase commitments are recorded at fair value and any change in fair value between periods has historically been recorded in the profit and loss section of our consolidated financial statements occasionally at inception the company will elect to designate the commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges under asc  gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets and

interest rates relating to our outstanding floating rate borrowings which totaled approximately  million as of december    the annualized impact of a hypothetical one percent change in interest rates on our floating rate debt outstanding as of december   would be to change interest expense by approximately  million  we help manage this risk through interest rate swap and cap agreements that we may periodically enter into in order to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding longterm debt in accordance with asc  all interest rate hedging instruments are recorded at fair value and any changes in the fair value between periods are recognized in earnings the fair values of our interest rate swaps and cap agreements are obtained from dealer quotes these values represent the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into account the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities we expect that any interest rate derivatives held would reduce our exposure to shortterm interest rate movements as of december    we had no floatingtofixed interest rate derivative agreements in place but we had such an agreement in place for a notional amount of  million as of december    which matured in february  the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivative liability was zero as of december    in accordance with asc  we recorded an expense representing cash settlements and changes in estimated fair value of the interest rate derivative

sec regulations to furnish us with copies of all section a reports they file based solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us and written representations that no other reports

item  executive compensation executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis the following section entitled “compensation discussion and analysis” is intended to provide material information that is necessary to an understanding of our compensation policies and decisions regarding the individuals named in the  summary compensation table in this annual report on form k these individuals may be referred to as our “named executive officers” or “neos” herein compensation overview objectives and philosophy our neo compensation framework in  emphasized retention and recruitment in a manner that was designed to support stockholder value and reward the performance of our neos with reference to the overall performance of the company we have developed a compensation framework that is designed to • attract motivate and retain key executives • centralize administration and control over individual compensation components • align the longterm economic interests of our executives with those of our stockholders by providing a meaningful portion of executive compensation in the form of equity awards and • reward excellence and performance by executives that increases the value of our stock and promotes an ethical culture amongst our employees these objectives governed the decisions that the compensation committee made during the  fiscal year and will govern the decisions it makes during fiscal year  with respect to the amount and type of compensation payable to our neos further we believe that these objectives strengthen our commitment to operate our business in conformity with the highest standards of ethical conduct current executive compensation framework in  following the sale by our former controlling stockholder delek group ltd of shares of its controlling stake in our outstanding common stock the compensation committee developed a new executive compensation framework for the company appropriate for our status as a company without a controlling stockholder the compensation committee has continued to refine this new framework in subsequent years and it continued to guide the compensation committee’s compensation decisions in  in general some of the key tenets of this new compensation framework are as follows • significant transparency and limited use of compensation committee discretion in the award and calculation of annual cash incentives • annual grants of longterm incentive awards • significant use of performance awards as an element of longterm incentive compensation • the elimination of residence family education and travel benefits • a phasing out of tax grossups and other tax reimbursements and • the elimination of dividend equivalents payable on appreciation awards such as stock appreciation rights elements of this framework are reflected in the employment agreements we entered into with mr yemin in november  the yemin agreement mr ginzburg in may  the ginzburg agreement mr smith in may  the smith agreement and mr miller in august  the miller agreement as well as the annual incentive plans for each fiscal year after  mr green executed an employment agreement in november  that significantly influenced his compensation in  before expiring in april  we entered into an employment agreement with mr green in november  which reflects elements of the current framework developed by the compensation committee as part of such transition by december    the compensation of all of our neos was governed by arrangements made after march  the current executive compensation framework is expected to continue to guide the terms of future compensatory arrangements with all of our executive officers  we currently expect that any future employment agreements entered into by our neos will continue to follow this framework while the employment agreement governing mr ginzburg’s compensatory arrangements that will take effect after may  deviates somewhat from this framework none of the variances will arise until after mr ginzburg’s status as an executive officer of the company ends on may   please see the narrative discussion under the heading “narrative to the  summary compensation table and grants of planbased awards in  table elements of our compensation the compensation framework for our neos consists primarily of the following three elements • fixed compensation  base salaries predetermined severance limited fringe benefits and perquisites and other benefits are primarily intended to attract and retain our neos by providing reliable compensation that is not contingent upon shortterm or longterm objectives • annual incentive compensation  performancebased annual cash bonuses are primarily intended to reward superior performance by our neos and support fixed compensation in attracting and retaining our neos • longterm incentive compensation  equity awards under the  plan and  plan are primarily intended to reward longerterm performance by our neos and align the longterm economic interests of our neos with our stockholders equity awards also complement each of the other two elements of our compensation by helping to attract and retain our neos and reward superior performance our primary forms of equity awards are ◦ appreciation awards under the  plan and  plan such as sars and nqsos we believe appreciation awards provide a strong link between executive compensation and increases in stockholder value because the value of an appreciation award is contingent upon an increase in the market price of our common stock between the grant date and the exercise date ◦ performancebased awards under the  plan and  plan such as performancebased rsus prsus we believe performancebased awards provide a strong link between executive compensation and increases in stockholder value because the value of the performancebased award is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions during the performance period ◦ full value awards such as rsus under the  plan and  plan phantom units dkl phantom units under the delek logistics gp llc  longterm incentive plan the logistics ltip and nonplanbased awards of membership interests gp membership interests in logistics gp the general partner of delek logistics partners lp delek logistics in contrast to appreciation and performancebased awards we believe full value awards are beneficial because their value is less dependent upon market conditions and therefore provide a more lasting incentive for our employees to remain with us with regard to the mix of these elements in our neo compensation framework our philosophy has been to weigh more heavily toward longterm incentive compensation and less toward fixed and annual incentive compensation and we expect this philosophy to continue each of these elements is discussed further below compensation setting process the compensation committee is responsible for determining the amount and mix of total compensation to be paid to our neos in making these determinations for our neos other than mr yemin the compensation committee typically solicits the input and recommendations of mr yemin and references external consultant studies of our compensation programs conducted contemporaneously or in recent years our goal from year to year is to develop an appropriate mix of fixed annual incentive and longterm incentive compensation to attract and retain our neos while simultaneously incentivizing them to exert their best efforts to maximize near term results and longer term value for our stockholders external consultants we believe that in some circumstances external compensation consultants can provide valuable assistance to us in setting neo compensation the compensation committee typically engages aon to provide reports related to the design and amount of neo compensation and to evaluate achievement under performance awards the compensation committee also engages aon to provide director compensation analyses and target compensation reports that are used to develop our director compensation framework finally the compensation committee typically engages the compensation consultants at findley to assist us with the development of our annual cash bonus plans and the evaluation of achievement under such plans we expect that from time to time the compensation committee will continue to reference data and guidance provided and to be provided by aon findley or similar external consultants in setting neo and director compensation the compensation committee believes that both aon and findley are independent of management and provide the compensation committee with objective guidance  benchmarking we believe that effective executive compensation practices depend upon the particular facts and circumstances of each employer and should not be dictated by the practices of others therefore our compensation practices for our neos are not designed to track any particular company or group of companies however we believe that referencing specific and aggregated compensation data from certain companies and groups of companies from time to time can be a useful tool in our decision making process for all areas of our compensation framework the compensation committee with the assistance of aon developed the group of independent refiners listed below the comparator group to be referenced from time to time in our  compensation decisions because these comparator companies vary in size the compensation committee may consider regression analyses of their data to provide more meaningful points of reference we may also reference unregressed data from a larger group of general industry companies with sizes similar to ours we believe this compensation data is derived from appropriate comparative crosssections of competitors in our industries and for our talent with market capitalization and operational complexity similar to ours and provides meaningful market information to be referenced from time to time in our compensation decisions alon usa energy inc pbf energy inc calumet specialty products partners lp phillips  cvr energy inc tesoro corporation hollyfrontier corporation valero energy corporation marathon petroleum corporation western refining inc fixed compensation a significant portion of our neos overall cash compensation is base salary generally neo base salaries have not been based upon specific measures of corporate performance but are determined by the compensation committee with reference to each employee’s individual performance position and responsibilities the fixed compensation of our other neos and other members of senior management competitive data and the recommendations of our chief executive officer except as it pertains to his own compensation we generally seek to position neo base salaries at or below the median of sizeregressed data from our comparator group and unregressed data from other companies of similar size to us the compensation committee believes that the fixed compensation paid to our neos is appropriate and helps achieve our objectives to attract retain and motivate our neos for a description of the base salaries and other elements of fixed compensation paid to our neos for   please refer to the  summary compensation table in this annual report on form k annual incentive compensation annual cash bonuses paid to our neos for a fiscal year are typically determined in the first quarter of the ensuing fiscal year and are intended to reward companywide performance and to a lesser extent individual performance during the year compensatory arrangements and annual bonuses no compensatory arrangement with any neo guarantees that an annual cash bonus will be paid to him each year the decision to award annual cash bonuses to our neos and the determination of the amounts thereof if any is the prerogative of the compensation committee andor the board  annual bonus plan in february   the compensation committee approved an annual incentive plan applicable to our neos for the  fiscal year the “  bonus plan” any payment of awards under the  bonus plan would be primarily based on the company’s earnings per share performance for the year ended december    as such may be adjusted by the compensation committee for certain noncash gains or losses “adjusted eps” under the  bonus plan no annual bonuses would be paid to our executive officers unless the company’s adjusted eps for the year ended december   equaled or exceeded  if the company’s adjusted eps equaled or exceeded  for the year ended december    the  bonus plan would be fully funded and annual bonuses would be authorized to our neos up to a maximum of  of their target annual bonuses however the compensation committee would further evaluate the companys performance and could exercise downward discretion based upon a matrix that attributes a  to the company’s financial performance under an adjusted eps  relative return on invested capital matrix b  to the company’s performance in refinery safety as measured by the company’s total recordable incident rate c  to  the companys performance in refinery safety as measured by tier i and ii events at company refining facilities under the osha process safety management standard and d  to the company’s performance in refinery utilization as compared to utilization statistics published by the united states department of energy and united states energy information administration in february   the compensation committee evaluated the payment of cash bonuses under the  bonus plan certified that adjusted eps of  had not been achieved and determined that annual cash bonuses would not be paid to our neos under the  bonus plan transaction bonus on october   the board of directors of the company approved the payment of a onetime discretionary cash bonus to eligible employees of the company including the named executive officers which was contingent upon and payable following completion of the transactions contemplated by that certain equity purchase agreement with compañía de petróleos de chile copec sa and its subsidiary copec inc a delaware corporation collectively “copec” whereby the company sold  of the equity interests in mapco express inc mapco fleet inc delek transportation llc nti investments llc and gdk bearpaw llc to copec the “retail transaction” the discretionary transaction bonuses paid to each of the named executive officers were as follows mr yemin  mr ginzburg  mr green  mr miller  and mr smith  the individual amounts of the named executive officers’ bonuses were determined in the discretion of the compensation committee in recognition of their efforts in connection with the retail transaction and based on the value received by the company from such transaction for more information on the retail transaction please see our annual report on form k for the year ended december    annual bonus plan in february   the compensation committee approved an annual incentive plan for the  fiscal year the “  bonus plan” payment of awards under the  bonus plan will primarily be based on the company’s adjusted eps for the year ending december   under the  bonus plan no annual bonuses will be paid to our executive officers unless the company’s adjusted eps for the year ending december   equals or exceeds  if this threshold is achieved the  bonus plan will be fully funded and the compensation committee may further evaluate the company’s relative performance and exercise downward discretion under the formula set forth below • financial performance  the compensation committee expects to attribute  of its evaluation to the company’s financial performance under an adjusted eps  relative roic matrix as set forth below adjusted eps relative roic performance percentile of peer group  ≥  ≥  ≥ ≥                                                • safety metrics  the compensation committee expects to attribute  of its evaluation apportioned equally to the company’s performance in safety as measured by each of i the company’s total recordable incident rate and ii the companys days away restricted or transferred rate • process safety management  environmental metrics  the compensation committee expects to attribute i  of its evaluation to tier i and ii events at company refining facilities under the osha process safety management standard and ii  of its evaluation to environmental metrics which consist of a  to spills and releases b  to flaring hours and c  to water exceedances • refinery reliability and utilization  the compensation committee expects to attribute the remaining  of its evaluation apportioned equally to the company’s performance in i refinery operational availability as compared to the operational availability of other us refineries as reported in the most recent published solomon associates north and south america fuels study at the beginning of the applicable bonus  year with the  bonus year being based on the  study published by solomon associates and ii refinery utilization as compared to utilization of other us refineries as reported in the most recent published solomon associates north and south america fuels study in february  the compensation committee evaluated the comparator group to be referenced from time to time in our  compensation decisions and determined that due to the consolidation in the industry western refining inc and alon usa energy inc would be removed longterm incentives the compensation committee believes that the grant of noncash longterm compensation primarily in the form of longterm incentive awards to our neos is appropriate to attract motivate and retain such individuals and enhance stockholder value through the use of noncash equity incentive compensation opportunities the compensation committee believes that the best interests of our stockholders would be most effectively advanced by enabling our neos who are responsible for our management growth and success to receive compensation from time to time in the form of longterm incentive awards because the vesting of longterm awards is based upon continued employment with us the awards are designed to provide our neos with an incentive to remain with us since longterm awards will increase in value in conjunction with an increase in the value of our common stock or other performance metrics such awards are also designed to align the interests of our neos and our stockholders compensatory arrangements and longterm incentives no compensatory arrangement with any neo guarantees that longterm incentive compensation will be awarded to him each year the decision to award longterm incentive compensation to our neos and the determination of the amounts thereof if any is the prerogative of the compensation committee andor the board  longterm incentive plan in anticipation of our initial

public offering in  the logistics ltip is a unitbased compensation plan for the benefit of logistics gps officers directors and employees or its affiliates and any consultants affiliates or other individuals who perform services for delek logistics because some members of the logistics gp board of directors primarily perform services on our behalf in their roles as our executive officers the logistics ltip is generally administered by the conflicts committee of the logistics gp board of directors which is a committee comprised entirely of independent directors the full logistics gp board of directors may also grant awards and the conflicts committee may delegate and has delegated to an executive officer of logistics gp in the past the authority to issue awards to nonsection  officers

similar events the logistics ltip permits the grant of dkl phantom units unit options restricted units unit appreciation rights distribution equivalent rights and other unitbased awards dkl phantom units are the only form of award granted under the logistics ltip to date and are accompanied by distribution equivalent rights providing for a lump sum cash amount equal to the accrued distributions

phantom unit awards made in  were to the independent members of the logistics gp board of directors mark cox a member of the logistics gp board of directors received an award of dkl phantom units in june  mr cox joined the company as an employee and was appointed as the chief administrative officer and executive vice president of the company and the logistics gp after such award was made pursuant to the terms of the logistics ltip upon the occurrence of an exchange transaction as defined in the logistics ltip and generally including a merger consolidation acquisition reorganization or similar extraordinary transaction with respect to delek logistics the logistics gp board of directors may in its discretion accelerate the vesting of dkl phantom units adjust the terms of any outstanding dkl phantom units or in the event of an exchange transaction in which delek logistics unitholders receive equity of another entity provide for the conversion of dkl phantom units into comparable awards for such entitys equity this provision provides the potential for immediate value to our neos in connection with an exchange transaction and therefore aligns our neos interests with those of delek

“k plan” for eligible employees including our neos administered by wells fargo institutional retirement and trust a business unit of wells fargo bank na employees must be at least  years of age with at least  hours worked to be eligible to participate in the k plan after the first anniversary of employment with us we match employee contributions to the k plan including those by our neos on a fully vested basis up to a maximum of six percent of eligible compensation since the  tax year we have reimbursed our executive officers for the cost of professional preparation of their income tax returns because our executive officers are typically among our most highly compensated employees their personal tax returns may be examined in connection with examinations of our tax returns in addition exchange act reporting requirements expose the executive officers’ compensation to public scrutiny we believe that encouraging our executive officers to seek professional tax advice will mitigate the personal risks that accompany the heightened scrutiny of their compensation provide us with a retention and recruiting tool for executive officers and protect us from the negative publicity that could surround an executive officer’s misstatement of his or her personal income tax liabilities in addition we provided limited additional perquisites to messrs yemin ginzburg and green in  pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements messrs yemin and ginzburg each received the use of a companyowned automobile we reimbursed mr green for the value of income taxes incurred as a result of vested rsus granted under his  employment agreement but such reimbursements were eliminated under the  green agreement we expect the perquisites provided to messrs yemin and ginzburg in  to continue in  pursuant to their current employment agreements and mr ginzburg will continue to receive the use of a companyowned automobile following the end of his service as our chief

terms of these arrangements see “potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol” in this annual report on form k we have established these arrangements because we believe that providing neos with compensation and benefit arrangements upon termination or an exchange transaction is necessary for us to be competitive with compensation packages of other companies in our industry and assists us in recruiting and retaining talented executives in addition formalizing these benefits provides us with certainty in terms of our obligations to an eligible executive in the event that our

terminated by the company without cause as defined in the yemin agreement or is terminated by mr yemin for good reason as defined in the yemin agreement other than in the context of a change in control as defined in the yemin agreement mr yemin will be entitled to receive i an amount equal to the product of a the sum of mr yemin’s base salary and target annual bonus in each case as in effect

termination the “health benefit continuation” iii the annual bonus to which mr yemin would have otherwise been entitled if his employment had continued through the end of the bonus year based upon the actual performance of the company prorated for the period of actual employment during the bonus year the “postemployment annual bonus” and iv the immediate vesting of unvested equity awards granted to mr yemin under the company’s longterm incentive plans but in the case of performance awards only to the extent that the applicable performance period has elapsed through the date of termination and in the case of other awards only to the extent that the awards would have otherwise vested within six months following the date of termination the yemin agreement also contains a double trigger change in control provision if within two years following a change in control mr yemin’s employment is terminated by the company other than for cause or by mr yemin for good reason mr yemin will be entitled to receive i an amount equal to the product of the separation base amount multiplied by three ii the health benefit continuation iii the postemployment annual bonus and iv the immediate vesting of all

termination of his employment other than termination for cause under the terms of the option mr yemin may purchase the residence at a price equal to the fair market value of the residence at the time of purchase we do not believe that the option would have provided a quantifiable benefit to mr yemin if he had exercised the option on december   because the option does not allow him to purchase the residence at less than fair market value if mr yemin’s employment terminates because of his death he will not be entitled to the abovenoted payments and benefits other than accrued and unused vacation however pursuant to our standard policies mr yemin’s beneficiaries would receive a death benefit equal to  times mr yemin’s salary at the time of death please see the narrative discussion following

party including any transactions requiring disclosure under item  other than transactions generally available to all employees and transactions involving less than  when aggregated with all similar transactions the policy states that in most instances the audit committee is best suited to review and approve related party transactions that may arise within the company however the policy permits the disinterested members of the board to exercise any authority otherwise assigned to the audit committee by the policy in particular the board believes that any related party transaction in which any director is interested should typically be reviewed and approved by all disinterested members of the board an interested director is not allowed to vote upon a transaction in which he is involved depending upon the issue presented the disinterested members of the board may request to hear from the interested director during the course of their deliberations but the interested director does not vote upon the matter and is not present during the vote on such matter a related party transaction may be consummated only if it is ratified or approved by the audit committee or disinterested members of the board and if it is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arms length dealings with an unrelated third party  item  principal accountant fees and services set forth below are

and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist in accordance with asc  and asc  intangibles  goodwill and other  delek evaluates the realizability of these longlived assets as events occur that might indicate potential impairment in doing so delek assesses whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset undiscounted and without interest charges if the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset we recognized an impairment charge of  million in  related to the writedown of certain idle refining equipment in our refining segment to net realizable value this impairment charge is included in other operating income in our consolidated statement of income for the period there were no impairment charges identified for the years ended december   or   equity method investments for equity investments that are not required to be consolidated under the variable or voting interest model we evaluate the level of influence we are able to exercise over an entity’s operations to determine whether to use the equity method of accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over an equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest participation in policymaking and other significant decisions and material intercompany transactions equity investments for which we determine we have significant influence are accounted for as equity method investments amounts recognized for equity method investments are included in equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets and adjusted for our share of the net earnings and losses of the investee and cash distributions which are separately stated in our consolidated statements of income and our consolidated statements of cash flows we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired based on our evaluations it was necessary to record an impairment charge of  million on our investment in alon usa based on the quoted market price of our alj shares as of september   during the year ended december    this impairment is reflected in the loss on impairment of equity method investment in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december    there were no impairment losses recorded on equity method investments for the year ended december    we did not hold any equity method investments in the year ended december    see note  for further information on our equity method investments capitalized

respectively was capitalized relating to these projects refinery turnaround costs refinery turnaround costs are incurred in connection with planned shutdowns and inspections of the tyler and el dorado refineries major units to perform necessary repairs and replacements refinery turnaround costs are deferred when incurred classified as property plant and equipment and amortized on a straightline basis over that period of time estimated to lapse until the next planned turnaround occurs refinery turnaround costs include among other things the cost to repair restore refurbish or replace refinery equipment such as vessels tanks reactors piping rotating equipment instrumentation electrical equipment heat exchangers and fired heaters goodwill and potential impairment goodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets deleks goodwill all of which was acquired in various business combinations is recorded at original fair value and is not amortized goodwill is subject to annual assessment to determine if an impairment of value has occurred and delek performs this review annually in the fourth quarter we could also be required to evaluate our goodwill if prior to our annual assessment we experience disruptions in our business have unexpected significant declines in operating results or sustain a permanent market capitalization decline if a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value the impairment assessment leads to the testing of the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to its carrying amount if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount a goodwill impairment charge is recorded our annual assessment of goodwill did not result in impairment during the years ended december     or   f derivatives delek records all derivative financial instruments including any interest rate swap and cap agreements fuelrelated derivatives over the counter otc future swaps forward contracts and future rin purchase and sales commitments that qualify as derivative instruments at estimated fair value in accordance with the provisions of asc  derivatives and hedging asc  changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in operations unless we elect to apply and qualify for the hedging treatment permitted under the provisions of asc  allowing such changes to be classified as other comprehensive income for cash flow hedges we validate the fair value of all derivative financial instruments on a periodic basis utilizing exchange pricing andor price index developers such as platts argus or opis on a regular basis delek enters into commodity contracts with counterparties for the purchase or sale of crude oil blendstocks and various finished products these contracts usually qualify for the normal purchase  normal sale exemption under asc  and as such are not measured at fair value deleks policy under the guidance of asc  derivatives and hedging  other presentation matters asc  is to net the fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty and offset these values against the cash collateral arising from these derivative positions fair value of financial instruments the fair values of financial instruments are estimated based upon current market conditions and quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments management estimates that the carrying value approximates fair value for all of deleks assets and liabilities that fall under the scope of asc  financial instruments asc  delek applies the provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosure asc  which defines fair value establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements asc  applies to our interest rate and commodity derivatives that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis asc  also applies to the measurement of our equity method investment in alon usa used in determining whether or not an impairment exists when circumstances require evaluation see note  for further information this standard also requires that we assess the impact of nonperformance risk on our derivatives nonperformance risk is not considered material to our financial statements at this time delek also applies the provisions of asc  as it pertains to the fair value option this standard permits the election to carry financial instruments and certain other items similar to financial instruments at fair value on the balance sheet with all changes in fair value reported in earnings by electing the fair value option in conjunction with a financial instrument an entity can achieve an accounting result similar to a fair value hedge without having to comply with complex hedge accounting rules as of both december   and   we elected to carry the stepout liability associated with our master supply and offtake agreement the supply and offtake agreement with j aron  company j aron at fair value and recognize all changes in the fair value of the stepout liability in cost of goods sold in the accompanying statements of income see notes  and  for further discussion selfinsurance reserves delek is primarily selfinsured for workers compensation and general liability costs with varying limits of per claim and aggregate stop loss insurance coverage that management considers adequate we maintain an accrual for these costs based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported differences between actual settlements and recorded accruals are recorded in the period identified environmental expenditures it is deleks policy to accrue environmental and cleanup related costs of a noncapital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated environmental liabilities represent the current estimated costs to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties this estimate is based on internal and thirdparty assessments of the extent of the contamination the selected remediation technology and review of applicable environmental regulations typically considering estimated activities and costs for the next  years unless a specific longer range estimate is practicable accruals for estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and include but are not limited to costs to perform remedial actions and costs of machinery and equipment that are dedicated to the remedial actions and that do not have an alternative use such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change we discount environmental liabilities to their present value if payments are fixed and determinable expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized asset retirement obligations delek recognizes liabilities which represent the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities including those that are conditional on a future event when the amount can be reasonably estimated if a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liability’s fair value f in the refining segment these obligations relate to the required disposal of waste in certain storage tanks asbestos abatement at an identified location and other estimated costs that would be legally required upon final closure of the tyler and el dorado refineries in the logistics segment these obligations relate to the required cleanout of the pipeline and terminal tanks and removal of certain abovegrade portions of the pipeline situated on rightofway property the reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of asset retirement obligations is as follows in millions     december          beginning balance         liabilities settled       — accretion expense       ending balance         in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things projected cash flows a creditadjusted riskfree rate and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligations renewable identification numbers  the us environmental protection agency “epa” requires certain refiners to blend biofuels into the fuel products they produce pursuant to the epa’s renewable fuel standard   rfs  alternatively credits called renewable identification numbers rins which may be generated andor purchased can be used to satisfy this obligation instead of physically blending biofuels rins obligation both of our refineries are obligated parties to the rfs see note  for further discussion of these requirements to the extent that either refinery is unable to blend biofuels at the required rate it must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy its annual requirement our rins obligation is based on the amount of rins we must purchase and the price of those rins as of the balance sheet date the cost of rins used each period is charged to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income we recognize a liability at the end of each reporting period in which we do not have sufficient rins to cover the rins obligation the liability is calculated by multiplying the rins shortage based on actual results by the period end rin spot price from time to time we may hold rins generated in excess of our current obligations  we recognize an asset at the end of each reporting period in which we have generated rins in excess of our rins obligation the asset is calculated by multiplying the rins surplus based on actual results by the period end rin spot price the value of rins in excess of our rins obligation if any would be reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets rins generated in excess of our current rins obligation may be sold or held to offset future rins obligations any such sales of excess rins are recorded in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income the assets and liabilities associated with our rins obligation are considered recurring fair value measurements see note  for further information from time to time delek enters into future commitments to purchase or sell rins at fixed prices and quantities which are used to manage the costs associated with our rins obligation these future rin commitment contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments under asc  and are recorded at estimated fair value in accordance with the provisions of asc  changes in the fair value of these future rin commitment contracts are recorded in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income see note  for further information revenue recognition revenues for products sold are recorded at the point of sale upon delivery of product which is the point at which title to the product is transferred and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured delek derives service revenue in the logistics segment as crude oil intermediate and refined products are shipped through delivered by or stored in our pipelines trucks terminals and storage facility assets as applicable we do not recognize product sales revenues for the logistics segment service revenues as title on the product never passes to us the majority of logistics segment service revenues are based on regulated tariff rates or contractual rates we record service revenue and related costs at gross amounts when delek is the primary obligor is subject to inventory risk has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influences product or service specifications or has several but not all of these indicators when delek is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as discussed previously we record net service revenue f cost of goods sold and operating expenses for the refining segment cost of goods sold includes all the costs of crude oil feedstocks and external costs operating expenses include the costs associated with the actual operations of the tyler and el dorado refineries and biodiesel facilities for the logistics segment cost of goods sold includes all costs of refined products additives and related transportation it also includes costs associated with the operation of our trucking assets operating expenses include the costs associated with the actual operation of owned terminals terminalling expense at thirdparty locations and pipeline maintenance costs sales use and excise taxes deleks policy is to exclude sales use and excise taxes from revenue when we are an agent of the taxing authority in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  principal agent considerations  deferred financing costs deferred financing costs associated with our revolving credit facilities are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred financing costs associated with our term loan facilities are included as a reduction to the associated debt balance in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets these costs represent expenses related to issuing our longterm debt and obtaining our lines of credit and are amortized ratably over the remaining term of the respective financing and included in interest expense in the

which provide the option after the initial lease term to renew the leases some of these lease arrangements include fixed rental rate increases while others include rental rate increases based upon such factors as changes if any in defined inflationary indices in accordance with asc  leases  operating leases  for all leases that include fixed rental rate increases delek calculates the total rent expense for the entire lease period considering renewals for all periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes economic penalty and records rental expense on a straightline basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of income income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of asc  income taxes asc  this statement generally requires delek to record deferred income taxes for the differences between the book and tax bases of its assets and liabilities which are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the net change during the year in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities exclusive of the amounts held in other comprehensive income asc  also prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize measure present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements finally asc  requires an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding the common shares used to compute delek’s basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows     year ended december             weighted average common shares outstanding          dilutive effect of equity instruments   —       weighted average common shares outstanding assuming dilution          f outstanding common share equivalents totaling    and  were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended december     and   respectively as these common share equivalents did not have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method these amounts include outstanding common share equivalents totaling  that were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation due to the net loss for the period for the year ended december    equitybased compensation asc  compensation  stock compensation asc  requires the cost of all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for sharebased payment arrangements asc  requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stockbased awards on the date of grant delek uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock option and stock appreciation right sar awards restricted stock units rsus are valued based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant performancebased rsus prsus include a market condition based on the companys total shareholder return over the performance period and are valued using a montecarlo simulation model we record compensation expense for these awards based on the grant date fair value of the award recognized ratably over the measurement period vested rsus and prsus are not issued until the minimum statutory withholding requirements have been remitted to us for payment to the taxing authority as a result the actual number of shares accounted for as issued may be less than the number of rsus vested due to any withholding amounts which have not been remitted we generally recognize compensation expense related to stockbased awards with graded or cliff vesting on a straightline basis over the vesting period it is our practice to issue new shares when sharebased awards are exercised new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial

provisions of asc  which defines fair value establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements asc  applies to our interest rate and commodity derivatives that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis the standard also requires that we assess the impact of nonperformance risk on our derivatives nonperformance risk is not considered material at this time asc  requires disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement level  inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level  for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through marketcorroborated inputs level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting our assumptions about pricing by market participants otc commodity swaps physical commodity purchase and sale contracts and interest rate swaps and caps are generally valued using industrystandard models that consider various assumptions including quoted forward prices spot prices interest rates time value volatility factors and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures the degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines the classification as level  or  our contracts are valued based on exchange pricing andor price index developers such as platts or

executed with the same counterparty and where the legal right of offset exists as of december   and    million and  million  respectively of cash collateral was held by counterparty brokerage firms and has been netted with the net derivative positions with each counterparty   derivative instruments we use derivatives to reduce normal operating and market risks with the primary objective of reducing the impact of market price volatility on our results of operations as such our use of derivative contracts is aimed at • limiting the exposure to price fluctuations of commodity inventory above or below target levels at each of our segments • managing our exposure to commodity price risk associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil feedstocks and finished grade fuel products at each of our segments • manage the cost of our rins obligation using future commitments to purchase or sell rins at fixed prices and quantities and • limiting the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our floating rate borrowings we primarily utilize otc commodity swaps generally with maturity dates of three years or less and interest rate swap and cap agreements to achieve these objectives otc commodity swap contracts require cash settlement for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed f or floating price and the market price on the settlement date interest rate swap and cap agreements economically hedge floating rate debt by exchanging interest rate cash flows based on a notional amount from a floating rate to a fixed rate at this time we do not believe there is any material credit risk with respect to the counterparties to these contracts from time to time we also enter into future commitments to purchase or sell rins at fixed prices and quantities which are used to manage the costs associated with our rins obligation these future rin commitment contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments under asc  and are recorded at estimated fair value in accordance with the provisions of asc  changes in the fair value of these future rin commitment contracts are recorded in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income in accordance with asc  certain of our otc commodity swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the change in fair value between the execution date and the end of period has been recorded in other comprehensive income the effective portion of the fair value of these contracts is recognized in income at the time the positions are closed and the hedged transactions are recognized in income from time to time we also enter into futures contracts with supply vendors that secure supply of product to be purchased for use in the normal course of business at our refining segment these contracts are priced based on an index that is clearly and closely related to the product being purchased contain no net settlement provisions and typically qualify under the normal purchase exemption from derivative accounting treatment under asc  the following table presents the fair value of our derivative instruments as of december   and   the fair value amounts below are

certain state deferred tax assets and net operating losses that may not be recoverable with future taxable income during the years ended december   and   we recorded increases to the valuation allowance of  million and  million  respectively in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible management believes it is more likely than not delek will realize the benefits of these deductible differences net of the existing valuation allowance the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced subsequently recognized tax benefit or expense relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets will be reported as an income tax benefit or expense in the consolidated statement of income state net operating loss carryforwards at december   totaled  million  a portion of which was subject to a valuation allowance and

efforts which were already being performed by the former operators of the tyler and el dorado refineries prior to our acquisition of those facilities for known contamination of soil and groundwater as

in disclosures of transactions or obligations between the partnership and alon usa energy inc or its other subsidiaries we are engaged in the business of refining and marketing of petroleum products primarily in the south central southwestern and western regions of the united states our business consists of three operating segments i refining and marketing ii asphalt and iii retail refining and marketing segment our refining and marketing segment includes a sour crude oil refinery located in big spring texas a light sweet crude oil refinery located in krotz springs louisiana and heavy crude oil refineries located in paramount bakersfield and long beach california the “california refineries” we primarily refine crude oil into petroleum products including various grades of gasoline diesel jet fuel petrochemicals petrochemical feedstocks asphalt and other petroleumbased products which are marketed primarily in the south central southwestern and western regions of the united states we are also shipping and selling gasoline into wholesale markets in the southern and eastern united states our california refineries have not processed crude oil since  due to the high cost of crude oil relative to product yield and low asphalt demand we own the big spring refinery and its integrated wholesale marketing operations through the partnership we market transportation fuels produced at the big spring refinery in central and west texas oklahoma new mexico and arizona we refer to our operations in these regions as our “physically integrated system” because we primarily supply our customers in this region with motor fuels produced at our big spring refinery and distributed through a network of pipelines and terminals that we own or access through leases or longterm throughput agreements the partnership sells motor fuels under the alon brand through various terminals to supply  alon branded retail sites including our retail segment convenience stores in addition the partnership sells motor fuels through our wholesale distribution network on an unbranded basis we market transportation fuel production from our krotz springs refinery through bulk sales exchange and wholesale channels the bulk sales and exchange arrangements are entered into with various oil companies and trading companies and are transported to markets on the mississippi river and the atchafalaya river as well as to the southern and eastern united states through the colonial pipeline we are also shipping and selling gasoline into certain wholesale markets in the southern and eastern united states through the colonial pipeline we are the majority owner of a renewable fuels facility in california that began commercial production in february  and converts tallow and vegetable oils into renewable fuels the produced renewable fuels are dropin replacements for petroleumbased fuels the renewable fuels facility generates both state and federal environmental credits as well as the federal blender’s tax credit when effective asphalt segment we own or operate  asphalt terminals located in texas big spring california paramount long beach elk grove bakersfield and mojave washington richmond beach arizona phoenix and flagstaff as well as asphalt terminals in which we own a  interest located in fernley nevada and brownwood texas the operations in which we have a  interest are recorded under the equity method of accounting and the investments are included as part of total assets in the asphalt segment data asphalt produced by our big spring refinery is transferred to the asphalt segment at prices substantially determined by reference to the cost of crude oil and rocky mountain asphalt which is intended to approximate wholesale market prices we market asphalt primarily as paving asphalt to road and materials manufacturers and as ground tire rubber polymer modified or emulsion asphalt to highway constructionmaintenance contractors sales of asphalt are seasonal with the majority of sales occurring between may and october retail segment our retail segment operates  convenience stores located in central and west texas and new mexico these convenience stores typically offer various grades of gasoline and diesel under the alon brand name and food products food service tobacco products nonalcoholic and alcoholic beverages general merchandise as well as money orders to the public primarily under the eleven brand name substantially all of the motor fuels sold through our retail segment are supplied by our big spring refinery which are transferred to the retail segment at prices substantially determined by reference to published commodity pricing information f alon usa energy inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements — continued dollars in thousands except as noted  basis of presentation and certain significant accounting policies a basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of alon usa energy inc and its consolidated subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated b use of estimates these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates c revenue recognition revenues from sales of refined products are earned and realized upon transfer of title to the customer based on the contractual terms of delivery including payment terms and prices generally title transfers at the refinery or terminal when the refined product is loaded into the common carrier pipelines trucks or railcars free on board origin in some situations title transfers at the customer’s destination free on board destination we occasionally enter into refined product buysell arrangements which involve linked purchases and sales related to refined product sales contracts entered into to address location quality or grade requirements these buysell transactions are included on a net basis in sales in the consolidated statements of operations and profits are recognized when the exchanged product is sold revenues from our inventory financing agreements note  are reported on a gross basis as we are considered a principal in these agreements in the ordinary course of business logistical and refinery production schedules necessitate the occasional sale of crude oil to third parties all purchases and sales of crude oil are recorded net in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations excise taxes on sales by our retail segment are presented on a gross basis supplemental information regarding the amount of such taxes included in revenues are provided in a footnote on the face of the consolidated statements of operations all other excise taxes are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations d cost classifications refining and marketing cost of sales includes crude oil blending materials rins and other raw materials inclusive of transportation costs which include costs associated with our crude oil and product pipelines asphalt cost of sales includes costs of purchased asphalt blending materials and transportation costs retail cost of sales includes motor fuels and merchandise retail fuel cost of sales represents the cost of purchased fuel including transportation costs and associated excise taxes merchandise cost of sales includes the delivered cost of merchandise purchases net of merchandise rebates and commissions cost of sales excludes depreciation and amortization which is presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations cost of sales for the year ended december   includes proceeds from insurance recoveries of  related to a business interruption insurance claim at our krotz springs refinery direct operating expenses which relate to our refining and marketing and asphalt segments include costs associated with the actual operations of our refineries and terminals such as energy and utility costs routine maintenance labor insurance and environmental compliance costs selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs relating to the operations of the convenience stores including labor utilities maintenance and retail corporate overhead costs refining and marketing and asphalt segments corporate overhead and marketing expenses are also included in selling general and administrative expenses interest expense includes interest expense on debt letters of credit financing costs associated with crude oil purchases financing fees and both the amortization and writeoff of original issuance discount and deferred debt issuance costs but excludes capitalized interest original issuance discount and debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method f alon usa energy inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements — continued dollars in thousands except as noted e cash and cash equivalents all highlyliquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates market value f accounts receivable financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivables credit is extended based on evaluation of the customer’s financial condition we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and require letters of credit prepayments or other collateral or guarantees as management deems appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a combination of current sales and specific identification methods credit risk is minimized as a result of the ongoing credit assessment of our customers and a lack of concentration in our customer base credit losses are charged to allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed uncollectible our allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets g inventories crude oil refined products blendstocks and asphalt including crude oil consignment inventory are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” inventory valuation method and market is determined using current estimated selling prices under the lifo valuation method the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs in periods of rapidly declining prices lifo inventories may have to be written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to lifo layers in prior periods an inventory writedown to market value results in a noncash accounting adjustment decreasing the value of our inventory and increasing our cost of sales such charges are subject to reversal in subsequent periods not to exceed lifo cost if prices recover in addition the use of the lifo inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years when inventory volumes decline and result in charging cost of sales with lifo inventory costs generated in prior periods materials and supplies are stated at average cost cost for retail merchandise inventories is determined under the retail inventory method and cost for retail fuel inventories is determined under the firstin firstout “fifo” method crude oil inventory consigned to others represents inventory that was sold to third parties which we are obligated to repurchase at the end of the respective agreements note  as a result of this requirement to repurchase the inventory no revenue was recorded on these transactions and the inventory volumes remain valued under the lifo method h hedging activity all derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value we consider all commodity forwards futures swaps and option contracts to be part of our risk management strategy for commodity derivative contracts not designated as cash flow hedges the net unrealized gains and losses for changes in fair value are recognized in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations we selectively designate certain commodity derivative contracts and interest rate derivatives as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gains or losses associated with these derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet and reclassified into the statement of operations in the period in which the underlying hedged forecasted transaction affects income the amounts recorded into the consolidated statement of operations for commodity derivative contracts are recognized as cost of sales and the amounts recorded for interest rate derivatives are recognized as interest expense the ineffective portion of the gains or losses on the derivative contracts if any is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as it is incurred derivative transactions related to our inventory financing agreements have been designated as fair value hedges of inventory the gain or loss on the derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in earnings in the same period i property plant and equipment the carrying value of property plant and equipment includes the fair value of the asset retirement obligation and has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at cost net of accumulated depreciation f alon usa energy inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements — continued dollars in thousands except as noted property plant and equipment net of salvage value are depreciated using the straightline method at rates based on the estimated useful lives for the assets or groups of assets beginning in the first month of operation following acquisition or completion the useful lives used to determine depreciation for our assets are as follows refining facilities  –  years pipelines and terminals  –  years retail  –  years other  –  years we capitalize interest costs associated with major construction projects based on the effective interest rate on aggregate borrowings leasehold improvements are depreciated on the straightline method over the shorter of the contractual lease terms or the estimated useful lives expenditures for major replacements and additions are capitalized refining and marketing segment and asphalt segment expenditures for routine repairs and maintenance costs are charged to direct operating expense as incurred retail segment routine repairs and maintenance costs are charged to selling general and administrative expense as incurred the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation of assets that are sold retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized as a gain or loss on disposition of assets in the consolidated statements of operations j impairment of longlived assets and assets to be disposed of we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its expected future cash flows an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value the future cash flows and fair values used in this assessment are estimates based on management’s judgment and assumptions assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs of disposition k asset retirement obligations we have asset retirement obligations with respect to our refineries due to various legal obligations to clean andor dispose of these assets at the time they are retired however the majority of these assets can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time provided that they are properly maintained andor upgraded it is our practice and intent to continue to maintain these assets and make improvements based on technological advances when a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of these assets or any component part of these assets we will estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that cost using established present value techniques we also have asset retirement obligations with respect to the removal of underground storage tanks and the removal of brand signage at our owned and leased retail sites the asset retirement obligation for storage tank removal on leased retail sites is accreted over the expected life of the underground storage tank which approximates the average retail site lease term note   l turnarounds and catalysts costs our refinery units require regular major maintenance and repairs that are commonly referred to as “turnarounds” catalysts used in certain refinery process units are typically replaced in conjunction with planned turnarounds we record the turnaround and catalysts costs as deferred charges in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we amortize the deferred costs on a straightline basis over the period of time estimated until the next turnaround occurs generally  to  years beginning the month after the completion of the turnaround the amortization of deferred turnaround and catalysts costs are presented in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations m income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date f alon usa energy inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements — continued dollars in thousands except as noted n stockbased compensation our stockbased compensation plan includes granting of awards in the form of options to purchase common stock stock appreciation rights restricted shares of common stock restricted common stock units performance shares performance units and senior executive plan bonuses to our directors officers and key employees we use the grant date fair value based method for calculating and accounting for stockbased compensation expenses related to stockbased compensation are included in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations note  o environmental expenditures environmental expenditures are recorded to expense or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefit are expensed liabilities for expenditures of a noncapital nature are recorded when environmental assessment andor remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated environmental liabilities represent the estimated costs to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties these estimates are based on internal and thirdparty assessments of the extent of the contaminations the selected remediation technology and review of applicable environmental regulations costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value unless payments are fixed or reliably determinable recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the receipt is deemed probable estimates are updated to reflect changes in factual information available technology or applicable laws and regulations note  substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be paid out over the next  years the amount of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations is impossible to determine with any degree of reliability p earnings loss per share we compute basic earnings loss per share by dividing net income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of participating common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings loss per share are calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period note  q other comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders’ equity that under us gaap are excluded from net income such as defined postretirement benefit plan adjustments and gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments designated in qualifying hedging relationships the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax reported in the consolidated balance sheets consists of defined postretirement benefit plan adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges r postretirement benefits we recognize the underfunded status of our defined pension and postretirement plans as a liability changes in the funded status of our defined pension and postretirement plans are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period the changes occur the funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants including the effect of assumed future salary increases plan assets are measured at fair value we use december  of each year as the measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all of our defined pension and postretirement plans s commitments and contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims assessments litigation fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment andor remediation can be reasonably estimated legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties which are probable of realization are separately recorded as assets and are not offset against the related environmental liability t goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed intangible assets are assets that lack physical substance excluding financial assets goodwill acquired in a business combination and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over  to  years goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired we use december  of each year as the valuation date for annual goodwill impairment testing purposes f alon usa energy inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements — continued dollars in thousands except as noted u new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” and the international accounting standards board jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts to provide goods or services to customers this standard is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption in august  the fasb updated the guidance to include a oneyear deferral of the effective date for the new revenue standard making the requirements of the standard effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after december   we are evaluating the guidance to determine the method of adoption and the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures based on our initial evaluation though not currently quantified the adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognized results of operations or cash flows in november  the fasb issued an accounting standards update simplifying the presentation of income taxes this updated standard eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead all deferred tax assets and liabilities will be required to be classified as noncurrent in a single line item the requirements from the updated standard are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted the adoption of this update will result in the reclassification of current deferred income tax assets to noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities in february  the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the present value of the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than  months the new guidance also will require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases the requirements from this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   we are evaluating the guidance to determine the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements in march  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify some provisions in stock compensation accounting the areas for simplification of this update involve the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification of the statement of cash flows this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted we do not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in june  the fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts financial institutions and other organizations will now use forwardlooking information to better inform their credit loss estimates the requirements from the updated standard are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   we are evaluating the guidance to determine the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements in august  the fasb issued an accounting standards update addressing eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of eliminating the existing diversity in practice the amendments from this update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   we do not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in january  the fasb issued new guidance that changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business the amendments from this update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   we do not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  california renewable fuels facility on march   we acquired control of the california renewable fuels facility which initially provides for us to receive approximately  of earnings and distributions of the facility we increased our original  ownership and obtained control of the california renewable fuels facility after certain operational milestones were achieved our share of earnings and distributions will change upon the achievement of certain cash distribution milestones in each case following the achievement of cash distribution milestones and assuming no further dilution to any of the members in the facility our share of

facility generates environmental credits in the form of renewable identification numbers california lowcarbon fuels standards credits and blender’s tax credits which are all recorded in net sales acquisitions achieved in stages require that in the period the acquiring company achieves control that it recognize  of the fair value of the net assets at that time additionally the existing equity interests of the company and of noncontrolling interest are required to be recorded at fair value the fair value of the facility was estimated by applying the market approach based on our analysis as

total assets        fair value we determine fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we classify financial assets and financial liabilities into the following fair value hierarchy • level       valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities • level       valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and • level       valued based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities as required we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs levels  and  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs level  within the fair value hierarchy we generally apply the “market approach” to determine fair value this method uses pricing and other information generated by market transactions for identical or comparable assets and liabilities assets and liabilities are classified within

derivative financial instruments we selectively utilize crude oil and refined product commodity derivative contracts to reduce the risk associated with potential price changes on committed obligations as well as to reduce earnings volatility we also utilize interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate risk we do not speculate using derivative instruments credit risk on our derivative instruments is mitigated by transacting with counterparties meeting established collateral and credit criteria mark to market we have certain contracts that serve as economic hedges which are derivatives used for risk management but not designated as hedges for financial accounting purposes all economic hedge transactions are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between reporting periods are recognized in earnings we have contracts that are used to fix prices on forecasted purchases of inventory which we refer to as futures and forwards futures represent trades executed on the new york mercantile exchange which have not been closed or settled at the end of the reporting period forwards represent physical trades for which pricing and quantities have been set but the physical product delivery has not occurred by the end of the reporting period during the years ended december    and  we had economic hedges in the form of swap contracts that fixed price

of crude oil as of december   cash flow hedges to designate a derivative as a cash flow hedge we document at the inception of the hedge the assessment that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the hedged item this assessment which is updated at least quarterly is generally based on the most recent relevant historical correlation between the derivative and the hedged item if during the term of the derivative the hedge is determined to be no longer highly effective hedge accounting is prospectively discontinued and any remaining unrealized gains or losses based on the effective portion of the derivative at that date are reclassified to earnings when the underlying transactions occur commodity derivatives as of december   we did not have
