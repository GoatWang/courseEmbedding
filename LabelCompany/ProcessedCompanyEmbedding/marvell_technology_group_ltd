quarter marvell executed well in the first quarter of fiscal year  as a renewed focus on its core businesses of storage networking and connectivity were able to generate revenue growth of

financial results for prior periods presented herein have been recast to reflect certain businesses that were classified as discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  conference call marvell will conduct a conference call on thursday may   at  pm pacific time to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal  interested parties may join the conference call by dialing  or  passcode  the call will be webcast by thomson reuters and can be accessed at the marvell investor relations website at httpinvestormarvellcom with a replay available following the call until june   discussion of nongaap financial measures nongaap financial measures exclude the effect of sharebased compensation expense amortization and writeoff of acquired intangible assets acquisitionrelated costs restructuring and other related charges litigation settlement and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to marvells core operating performance in fiscal  marvell began using a nongaap tax rate to compute the nongaap tax provision this nongaap tax rate is based on marvells estimated annual gaap income tax forecast adjusted to account for items excluded from gaap income in calculating marvells nongaap income as well as the effects of significant nonrecurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency marvells nongaap tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events that may materially affect the nongaap tax rate such as tax law changes significant changes in marvells geographic mix of revenue and expenses or changes to marvells corporate structure for the first quarter of fiscal  a nongaap tax rate of  has been applied to the nongaap financial results nongaap diluted net income per share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing nongaap net income from continuing operations by nongaap weighted average shares outstanding diluted for purposes of calculating nongaap diluted net income per share the gaap weighted average shares outstanding diluted is adjusted to exclude the potential benefits of sharebased compensation expected to be incurred in future periods but not yet recognized in the financial statements the expected compensation costs are treated as additional proceeds assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the gaap treasury stock method marvell believes that the presentation of nongaap financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to marvells financial condition and results of operations while marvell uses nongaap financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance marvell does not consider these measures to be a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap consistent with this approach marvell believes that disclosing nongaap financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for gaap financial measures allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational performance externally management believes that investors may find marvells nongaap financial measures useful in their assessment of marvells operating performance and the valuation of marvell internally marvells nongaap financial measures are used in the following areas managements evaluation of marvells operating performance managements establishment of internal operating budgets managements performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models and managements determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performancebased equity awards adjustments may vary from award to award nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of marvells business as determined in accordance with gaap as a result you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of marvells results as reported under gaap marvell expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the nongaap adjustments described above and exclusion of these items from marvells nongaap net income should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual infrequent or nonrecurring forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of  this press release contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties including marvells expectations regarding its second quarter of fiscal  financial outlook and marvells use of nongaap financial measures as important supplemental information words such as anticipates expects intends plans projects believes seeks estimates can may will would and similar expressions identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of results and should not be considered as an indication of future activity or future performance actual events or results may differ materially from those described in this press release due to a number of risks and uncertainties including but not limited to adverse impacts of litigation or regulatory activities marvells ability to implement its restructuring in a timely manner the amount and timing of anticipated charges associated with the restructuring marvells ability to increase its operational efficiency and decrease its operating expenses to the anticipated level  marvells reliance on a few customers for a significant portion of its revenue
