this is a putative class action involving alleged violations of the securities exchange act of  the electrical workers pension fund local  international brotherhood of electrical workers brought suit on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons against biogen inc and two biogen employees the complaint contends that class members were harmed when they purchased biogen securities at prices that were artificially inflated by the companys false and misleading statements about its products this action raises issues similar to those raised in in re biogen inc securities litigation no cv d mass biogen i which this court dismissed on june   see biogen i  wl  an appeal of that action is currently pending in the first circuit pursuant to § dab of the securities exchange act of   usc § uab three putative class members or groups—metzler asset management gmbh and erstesparinvest kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbh metzler the city of miami fire fighters and police officers retirement trust city of miami and frankfurttrust investment gmbh and frankfurttrust investment luxemburg ag frankfurttrust—have each moved to be appointed as lead plaintiff and to approve of their selection of lead counsel frankfurttrust has also moved to stay this litigation pending resolution of the appeal of biogen i for the reasons set forth below metzlers motion will be granted and the motions of the city of miami and frankfurttrust will be denied frankfurttrusts motion to stay will be denied without prejudice i background unless otherwise noted all facts are stated as set forth in the complaint biogen is a biopharmaceutical company that develops therapies for neurological autoimmune and hematologic disorders compl ¶  the companys products include prescription medicines used to treat among other things multiple sclerosis id biogen is based in cambridge massachusetts id at ¶  one of biogens products is the drug tecfidera which was approved by the food and drug administration in  for use in treating multiple sclerosis ms id at ¶  tecfidera was the main driver of biogens revenues in  and  id at ¶  biogen emphasized the importance of tecfidera in its october   form q stating that its current revenues depend upon continued sales of our principal products including tecfidera id in the spring of  the ms institute at shepherd center in atlanta georgia—a leading prescriber of tecfidera in the united states—began monitoring patients taking tecfidera for possible side effects id at ¶  the center observed that patients on tecfidera were at an elevated risk of developing low lymphocyte counts id lymphoctyes are a subtype of white blood cells necessary for proper immune system functioning id between april and june of  biogen was aware that the center was reducing its tecfidera prescriptions id at ¶  in august  the medical director of the center notified biogen that tecfidera was causing low lymphocyte counts among approximately  of its ms patients taking the drug id at ¶  at that time the center stopped prescribing tecfidera altogether and made biogen aware of its decision to do so id at ¶  according to the complaint biogen did not disclose those developments regarding tecfidera to the public but rather continued to highlight the drugs safety and growing sales id at ¶  on october   biogen did publicly disclose that an ms patient who had taken tecfidera for four and a half years had died of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml an infection caused by a virus that is dangerous for individuals with weakened immune systems id at ¶  after that announcement biogen continued to promote the safety of tecfidera and its increasing prescription numbers and in january  stated that it would continue to be a major business driver for the company id at ¶¶   on april   biogen disclosed that the pml death was having some effect on tecfidera sales stating that new patients were being put on the drug at a slower rate than before id ¶  the next month it stated that fallout from the pml death was contained and that doctors beliefs about the safety of the drug were back to where they had been before the pml death id ¶  on july   biogen announced that it was cutting its revenue guidance in half based largely on revised expectations for the growth of tecfidera id at ¶  biogens stock price which had closed at  per share on july   closed at  per share on july  id at ¶  on october   the electrical workers pension fund local  international brotherhood of electrical workers filed a complaint on behalf of all purchasers of biogens publicly traded securities between july   and july   the complaint contends that biogen and the individual defendants violated federal securities law by making false and misleading public statements concerning biogen products on december   metlzer the city of miami and frankfurttrust each moved to be appointed lead plaintiff and to approve their selection of lead counsel frankfurttrust also moved to stay the proceeding pending resolution of biogen i ii legal standard the private securities litigation reform act pslra sets forth detailed procedures for bringing and maintaining securities class actions the provisions are intended to increase the chances that securities fraud cases are brought by investors who have substantial and genuine interests in the litigation see in re party city sec litig  frd   dnj  specifically the pslra provides a method for identifying the plaintiff or plaintiffs who are mostly strongly aligned with the class of shareholders and most capable of controlling the selection and activities of counsel under the pslra a plaintiff seeking to represent a class must provide a sworn certification at the time the complaint is filed that  states that plaintiff has reviewed and authorized the complaint  states that plaintiff did not purchase the security at issue in the complaint at the direction of counsel or in order to participate in a lawsuit  states that plaintiff is willing to serve as a representative party and participate in trial  sets forth all of plaintiffs transactions involving the security that is the subject of the complaint during the class period  identifies any other action filed in the previous three years in which plaintiff has sought to be a class representative and  states that plaintiff will not accept payment for being the representative party beyond a pro rata share of the recovery without court approval  usc § ua a plaintiff who brings such an action must within  days of filing the complaint publish notice of the pendency of the class action in a widelycirculated national businessoriented publication or wire service  usc § uaai within  days after publication of the notice any other person or group of persons who are members of the putative class may apply to the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the action whether or not they have filed a complaint  usc §§ uaaiii once the day period following publication of notice has run the court shall appoint as lead plaintiff the member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members  usc § uabi there is a rebuttable presumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any such action is the person or persons that  has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to notice by the party who filed the complaint  has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class and  otherwise satisfies the requirements of fed r civ proc rule   usc § uabiii this presumption may only be rebutted upon proof by a member of the purported class that the person identified as the most adequate plaintiff either will not fairly and adequately represent the class or is subject to unique defenses  usc § uabiiiii iii analysis a presumed lead plaintiff under the pslra the court must presume that the lead plaintiff is the person or group of persons who  filed the complaint or made a motion to be lead plaintiff  has the largest financial interest in the relief sought and  otherwise satisfies rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure  usc § uabiiii here metzler meets all statutory requirements that govern the courts choice of presumed lead plaintiff although metzler did not file the complaint it did make a motion to be lead plaintiff the plaintiff that did file the complaint—electrical workers pension fund—did not move to be lead plaintiff as to the second factor metzler appears to have the largest financial interest of any other person or group of persons in the relief sought metzler has alleged total losses of approximately  on their purchases of biogen securities frankfurttrust has alleged total losses of approximately  and the city of miami has alleged losses of  metzler is by a substantial margin the person or group of persons with the largest financial interest in the relief sought at oral argument frankfurttrust contended that while it did not have the largest total interest in the relief sought it did have the largest individual fund loss that however is not the standard set forth in  usc § uabiii it appears to be undisputed that metzler is the person or group with the largest total financial interest in the relief sought finally metzler otherwise satisfies the requirements of rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure at least for the purposes of the present motion rule  provides that a party may serve as a class representative only if four requirements are met  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable  there are questions of law or fact common to the class  the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and  the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class fed r civ p a in deciding a motion to serve as lead plaintiff a court need only make findings as to the typicality and adequacy of the proposed lead plaintiff see in re tronox inc sec litig  frd   sdny  these findings need only be preliminary id at this stage of the suit both requirements are sufficiently met as a preliminary matter metzlers claims appear to be typical of the putative classs claims in that they arise from the same course of events and involve the same legal theory as to the claims of the rest of the class in re lernout  hauspie sec litig  fsuppd   d mass  metzler also as a preliminary matter appears capable of adequately protecting the interests of the class in that it possesses common interests and an absence of conflict with the class members and    plaintiffs attorneys are qualified experienced and vigorously able to conduct the litigation id thus metzler is the presumed lead plaintiff that presumption may only be rebutted upon proof by a member of the purported class that the metzler either will not fairly and adequately represent the class or is subject to unique defenses  usc § uabiiiii no such proof has been presented here metzlers motion to be appointed lead plaintiff is therefore granted b choice of counsel pursuant to § dabv of the exchange act the presumptive lead plaintiff may select and retain counsel to represent the purported plaintiff class  usc §uabv lead plaintiffs choice of counsel is subject to approval by the court id metzler has chosen the law firm of motley rice to serve as lead counsel for the proposed class this court is aware of no reason why it should not approve of metzlers choice it appears that the firm has successfully handled a number of shareholder and securities class actions accordingly the court will approve of metzlers selection of motley rice as lead counsel iv conclusion for the reasons stated above the motion of metzler asset management gmbh and erstesparinvest kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbh to be appointed lead plaintiff and to approve its choice of lead counsel docket no  is granted the motion of the city of miami fire fighters and police officers retirement trust to be appointed lead plaintiff and to approve its choice of lead counsel docket no  is denied the motion of frankfurttrust investment gmbh and frankfurttrust investment luxemburg ag to be appointed lead plaintiff and to approve its choice of lead counsel docket no  is denied and its motion to stay the

income security act regulates employee benefit and pension plans both of which can be tied into stock options employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company andor its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk issues involved in erisa include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options denying an employee rights granted by a stock option agreement misrepresenting the value of the stock failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given furthermore it is a violation of erisa for an employer to take deductions from an employees paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan under erisa it is illegal for an employer to discharge fine suspend expel discipline or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan… claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan in such situations the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken companies that have had erisa complaints filed against them include yrc worldwide inc concerning the
