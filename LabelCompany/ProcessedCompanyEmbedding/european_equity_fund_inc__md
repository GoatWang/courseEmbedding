the long postcrisis economic recovery to continue in  as a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to continue in    source gsam as of january  our month crossasset

provides that the board of directors be divided into three classes of directors serving staggered threeyear terms and until their successors are elected and qualify the term of office for directors in class i expires at the  annual meeting class ii at the next succeeding annual meeting and class iii at the following succeeding annual meeting two class i nominees mr detlef bierbaum and mr robert h wadsworth are proposed in this proxy statement for election if elected each of the two class i nominees will serve a threeyear term of office until the annual meeting of stockholders in  and until his respective successor is elected and qualifies one class iii nominee mr richard karl goeltz is proposed in this proxy statement for election if elected mr goeltz will serve a twoyear term of office until the annual meeting of stockholders in  and until his successor is elected and qualifies the fund regrets that mr john h cannon who made significant contributions as a director of the fund since  and also served as chairman of the audit committee recently passed away the size of the board was reduced by one class i director on april   as a result of mr cannons passing as a result of mr werner walbröls retirement from the board each class of directors of the board would not be of approximate equal size if no further action were taken under the funds bylaws and the new york stock exchange listed company manual rule  nyse rule  the classes of the funds board should be of approximately equal size accordingly the funds nominating committee nominated mr goeltz to fill a class iii vacancy created by mr walbröls retirement with mr goeltzs resignation from class i contingent upon his election to the board as a member of class iii if each nominee is elected each class of directors of the board would be of equal size and in compliance with the requirements of the funds bylaws and nyse rule  should any vacancy occur on the board of directors the remaining directors would be able to fill that vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum any director elected by the board to fill a vacancy would hold office until the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies if the size of the board is increased additional directors will be apportioned among the three classes to make all classes as nearly equal as possible unless authority is withheld it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy card to vote each proxy card for the election of the four nominees listed above each nominee has indicated that he will serve as a director if elected but if any nominee should be unable to serve proxies will be voted for any other person determined by the persons named in the form of proxy card in accordance with their discretion the board of directors has no reason to believe that any of the above nominees will be unable to serve as a director    b oard of d irectors i nformation the management of the business and affairs of the fund is overseen by the board of directors directors who are not interested persons of the fund as defined in the investment company act are referred to as independent directors and directors who are interested persons of the fund are referred to as interested directors certain information concerning the funds governance structure and each director is set forth below experience skills attributes and qualifications of the funds directors      the nominating and governance committee of the funds board which is composed entirely of independent directors reviews the experience qualifications attributes and skills of potential candidates for nomination or election by the board and conducts a similar review in connection with the proposed nomination of current directors for reelection by stockholders when assessing a candidate for nomination it is the policy of the nominating and governance committee to consider amongst other criteria whether the individuals background skills and experience will complement the background skills and experience of other nominees and will contribute to the diversity of the board the nominating and governance committee assesses the effectiveness of this policy as part of its annual self assessment additional information concerning the nominating and governance committees consideration of nominees appears in the description of the committee following the table below the board has concluded that based on each directors experience qualifications attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other directors that each director is qualified and should continue to serve as such in determining that a particular director was and continues to be qualified to serve as a director the board has considered a variety of criteria none of which in isolation was controlling in addition the board has taken into account the actual service and commitment of each director during his tenure including the directors participation in board and committee meetings as well as his current and prior leadership of standing and ad hoc committees in concluding that each should continue to serve information about the specific experience skills attributes and qualifications of each director which in each case led to the boards conclusion that the director should serve or continue to serve as a director of the fund is provided in the table following the risk oversight section below the board believes that collectively the directors have balanced and diverse experience qualifications attributes and skills which allow the board to operate effectively in governing the fund and protecting the interests of shareholders among other attributes common to all directors are their willingness and ability to commit the necessary time and attention to their duties as directors their ability to review critically evaluate question and discuss information provided to them including information requested by the directors to interact effectively with each other and with deutsche investment management americas inc the funds administrator the administrator deutsche asset management international gmbh the investment adviser and other service providers counsel and the funds independent registered public accounting firm to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as directors references to the qualifications attributes and skills of directors are pursuant to requirements of the securities and exchange commission do not constitute holding out of the board or any director as having special expertise or experience and shall not be deemed to impose any greater responsibility or liability on any director or on the board by reason thereof    board structure and oversight function      the board is responsible for oversight of the fund the fund has engaged the administrator and the investment adviser to manage the fund on a daytoday basis the board is responsible for overseeing the administrator and the investment adviser and the funds other service providers in the operations of each fund in accordance with the funds investment objective and policies and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of the investment company act and other applicable federal state and other securities and other laws and the funds charter and bylaws the board meets in person at regularly scheduled meetings four times throughout the year in addition the directors may meet in person or by telephone at special meetings or on an informal basis at other times the directors also regularly meet outside the presence of any representatives of the administrator and the investment adviser as described below the board has established five standing committees  the audit nominating and governance advisory valuation and executive committees  and may establish ad hoc committees or working groups from time to time to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities each committee other than the executive committee is composed exclusively of independent directors each year the directors evaluate the performance of the board and its committees the responsibilities of each committee including its oversight responsibilities are described further below the independent directors have also engaged independent legal counsel and may from time to time engage consultants and other advisors to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities the chairmans duties include setting the agenda for each board meeting in consultation with management presiding at each board meeting meeting with management between board meetings and facilitating communication and coordination between the directors and management mr christian strenger the chairman of the funds board of directors is an interested director as defined in the investment company act because he is a member of the supervisory board of a company that is affiliated with the administrator and the investment adviser and because of his ownership of shares of the ultimate parent of the administrator and the investment adviser the directors believe that it is appropriate for mr strenger to serve as chairman and that his service benefits shareholders because of his extensive knowledge of the investment management industry the deutsche bank organization and the funds and because he is a leading corporate governance expert in germany and internationally in addition the directors note that although mr strenger is an interested director as defined in the investment company act he is not involved in the management of the fund and is not an officer or director of the administrator or the investment adviser the independent directors are satisfied that they can act independently and effectively without having an independent director serve as chairman and note that a key structural component for ensuring that they are in a position to do so is for the independent directors to constitute a substantial majority of the board mr goeltz an independent director and chairman of the nominating and governance committee serves as lead independent director for the fund and as such is available to act as liaison between the independent directors and management and to consult with the chairman to the extent deemed appropriate risk oversight      the fund is subject to a number of risks including investment compliance and operational risks daytoday risk management with respect to the fund resides with the administrator and the investment adviser or other service providers depending on the nature of the risk subject to supervision by the administrator the board has charged the investment adviser and its affiliates with i identifying events or circumstances the occurrence    of which could have demonstrable and material adverse effects on the fund ii to the extent appropriate reasonable or practicable implementing processes and controls reasonably designed to lessen the possibility that such events or circumstances occur or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur and iii creating and maintaining a system designed to evaluate continuously and to revise as appropriate the processes and controls described in i and ii above risk oversight forms part of the boards general oversight of each funds investment program and operations and is addressed as part of various regular board and committee activities each of the administrator the investment adviser and the funds other principal service providers has an independent interest in risk management but the policies and the methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from the funds and each others in the setting of priorities the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls oversight of risk management is provided by the board and the audit committee the directors regularly receive reports from among others management the funds chief compliance officer its independent registered public accounting firm counsel and internal auditors for the administrator as appropriate regarding risks faced by the fund and the administrators risk management programs not all risks that may affect the fund can be identified nor can controls be developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects the processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness and some risks are simply beyond the reasonable control of the fund or the administrator its affiliates or other service providers moreover it is necessary to bear certain risks such as investmentrelated risks to achieve the funds goals i

committee of the board and also advises the board regarding governance matters generally and confirms that the board and audit committee undertake annual selfevaluations to be eligible for nomination as a director a person must at the time of such persons nomination have relevant experience and country knowledge and must not have any conflict of interest as those terms are defined in the funds bylaws the relevant portions of the funds bylaws describing these requirements are included as annex a the nominating and governance committee may also take into account additional factors listed in the nominating and governance committee charter which generally relate to the nominees industry knowledge business experience education ethical reputation special skills ability to work well in group settings and the ability to qualify as an independent director when assessing a candidate for nomination the nominating and governance committee considers whether the individuals background skills and experience will complement the background skills and experience of other nominees and will contribute to the diversity of the board    the nominating and governance committee will consider nominee candidates properly submitted by stockholders in accordance with applicable law the funds charter or bylaws resolutions of the board and the qualifications and procedures set forth in the nominating

governance committee in accordance with its charter the nominating and governance committee reviews each directors affiliations and relationships for purposes of determining whether or not the director qualifies as an independent director the nominating and governance committee also considers each directors independence more generally as well as various governance best practices including the suggestion of a nonus corporate governance code that a board of directors should state its reasons if it determines that a director is independent notwithstanding that the director has served for more than nine years from the date of his first election the nominating and governance committee has concluded that each director other than the chairman of the board is an independent director and that it was satisfied that i those independent directors who have served for more than nine years continue to be independent in character and judgment ii the experience of such directors with the fund permit them to make extremely valuable contributions to the functioning of the board and iii the views of such directors are not entrenched as a result of the length of service to the funds the nominating and governance committee based its conclusion in part on its observation that such directors regularly demonstrate their independence by their questioning and challenging of management at and between board meetings the nominating and governance committee also noted that none of the directors serves on the board of more than three registered investment companies advised by the investment adviser and that only one director serves on the board of a large number of registered investment companies advised by an affiliate of the investment adviser the nominating and governance committee believes that such service provides the director with insights that permit him to make valuable contributions to the deliberations of the board and noted that his independence from management has been amply and repeatedly demonstrated by his participation in meetings including by his insightful questioning of managements proposals the nominating and governance committee also believes that the receipt of compensation for service as a director does not adversely affect the independence of any directors character and judgment and notes that fund industry best practices encourage service on multiple boards    all members on each of the five committees of the board are not interested persons as the term is defined in the investment company act with the exception of mr strenger who is a member of the executive committee during the past fiscal year the board of directors had four regular meetings each incumbent director who served as a director during the past fiscal year attended at least  of the aggregate number of meetings of the board and meetings of board committees on which that director served the board has a policy that encourages directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders to the extent that travel to the annual meeting of stockholders is reasonable for that director two directors attended the  annual meeting of stockholders

the fund therefore the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at below or above net asset value this fund is diversified and primarily focuses its investments in equity securities of issuers domiciled in countries that are members of the european union thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that region investing in foreign securities presents certain risks such as currency fluctuations political and economic changes and market risks any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more

improved in europe throughout the year pmis and the german ifo index advanced further with the eurozone pmi reaching a new high for the year at  and the ifo at   consumer confidence was also up for the eurozone as a whole the spillover from low oil prices had a delayed positive effect on consumption eurozone gross domestic product gdp gradually moved away from the zerogrowth line reaching  towards yearend with germany and spain delivering the highest growth while france improved in the second half of the year finally overall credit development continues to improve the two key regions for european exporters north america and china showed diverging trends in  in terms of growth china was a key driver over the last few years but showed a considerable slowdown this year the surprising devaluation of their currency the renminbi versus the us dollar in august caused a considerable correction of chinese equity markets with repercussions for equity markets worldwide conversely the us economy stayed on a steady gdp growth path of between  and  despite the negative effect of low oil prices on the energy and cyclical industrial sectors global liquidity conditions and the monetary policy of the european central bank provided a supportive framework for equities quantitative easing was announced in february and in december  was extended until march  the much anticipated us

health care and technology showed aboveaverage positive surprises sector performance diverged strongly with energy and materials suffering doubledigit losses – and – respectively while three sectors had doubledigit gains consumer staples  technology  and health care  respectively besides earnings brisk merger and acquisition activity was supportive overall for  european markets delivered another successful year for equities in terms of performance the portfolio again outperformed its benchmark driven by a significantly positive contribution from stock selection many of our quality growth stocks such as chr hansen as grandvision lonza group ltd societe bic and partners group holding performed very well the allocation contribution was negative due to our temporary market hedge and cash holdings however this again lowered the volatility of the portfolio an important goal of our more defensive stability strategy the portfolio positioning of maintaining a stable core of quality growth stocks worked well we added some more cyclical value stocks when a cyclical recovery looked likely in q and after the summers market correction in q when adding such riskier stocks we look for growth that to a high degree is dependent on a companys own efforts and not on factors beyond managements control the financial sector weight of the portfolio increased as a result of adding stocks in domestic retail banking lloyds and private equity partners group in addition we generally hedge equity market risk whenever the portfolio of equities has aboveaverage market risk and our shortterm market outlook is negative the goal is to reduce potential losses and deliver more stable returns on average in  the hedges reduced the funds return but also reduced the volatility of returns click to

equities globally seem more challenging in  there are a number of factors supporting european equities on the macro side early indicators are continuing to improve for most european economies and the windfall for consumers from lower oil prices is even larger after the latest drop unlike the us monetary policy in the european union eu is still in expansionary mode with an increasing quantitative easing program there exist a number of potential risks such as further deterioration of chinas economy and political risks including further middle east conflicts the continuation of the refugee crisis and an impasse in eu reforms similarly to the us europe continues to face some unsolved structural issues there is only a slow political path to solve the growing liabilities of social welfare in the face of negative demographics in most european countries levels of indebtedness continue to be excessive a good portion of these negative factors seem discounted by the pessimistic sentiment of investors at the start of  with investors cash balances high and rates near zero the pressure to invest into equities is high and dividend yields exceed corporate bond yields from the bottomup view profit margins are still below longterm historical levels we may see a catchup effect to the us where margins are at their peaks in addition valuations in europe are not excessive and considerably

valuesales ratio is  to  source bloomberg as of january    this equals an average  discount of european equities question what sectors and companies will benefit from the drop in oil prices answer the foremost beneficiaries are companies with products that depend on consumer discretionary spending here the range is wide from telecommunications companies selling higherpriced subscriptions eg telefonica deutschland retailers selling affordable luxury eg dufry airlines with strongly expanding margins eg easyjet to biggerticket items such as automobiles eg daimler companies with large costs in oil as a raw material such as industrials and chemicals need to be judged carefully in many cases there is a passthrough to the price of end products question what type of structural growth do you find in europe answer this is very companyspecific and fortunately there are many stocks to choose from due to demographics and rising living standards health care continues on a solid growth path for

mandates as the fund as well as the representation by deawmi that it does not manage any other institutional accounts that are similar to the fund and its review of the reasons that it does not consider institutional fee rates to be relevant to the consideration of appropriate fee rates payable by investment companies such as the fund the directors noted that the management fee paid by a us openend fund advised by deawmi was somewhat lower that the current effective combined advisory and administrative fee for the fund while nonus openend funds advised by deawmi pay management fees that while not entirely comparable to the fees payable by the fund to deawmi and dima are substantially higher than the combined advisory and administration fee rate paid by the fund the fund’s management expense comparison group consisted of six closedend developed market funds including the fund and  openend european region funds plus the fund selected by lipper the directors reviewed information comparing the combined advisory and administrative fees payable under the agreement and the administration agreement for this purpose noting that deawmi and dima are affiliated companies the directors noted that the combined advisory and administrative fee rate paid by the fund in  of  was above the average and median fee rates of both comparison groups but that the assets of the fund were very significantly below the average and median asset levels of such groups and that at asset levels of  million the fund’s effective fee rate would be below the median and the average for the closedend group and above the median and average for the openend group the directors noted that the fund’s effective fee rate reflects the effect of breakpoints the directors also considered the fund’s total expense ratio in comparison to the fees and expenses of  closedend international equity funds compiled by management based on morningstar data the directors also noted that the fund’s expense ratio was above the median and the average and in the third quartile of the comparison group management explained that this was principally the result of the fund’s relatively small asset base and reviewed steps that had been and were being implemented as part of continuing efforts to reduce expenses the directors concluded that the fund’s expense ratio was satisfactory economies of scale the directors noted that the investment advisory fee schedule in the agreement contains breakpoints that reduce the fee rate on assets above specified levels the directors recognized that breakpoints may be an appropriate way for deawmi to share its economies of scale with some funds that have substantial assets or that may grow materially over the next year however they also recognized that there is no direct relationship between the economies of scale realized by funds and those realized by deawmi as assets increase largely because economies of scale are realized if at all by deawmi across a variety of products and services and not only in respect of a single fund they also noted that the fund’s assets have diminished in recent years having taken these factors into account the directors

“am” has adopted and implemented the following policies and guidelines which it believes are reasonably designed to ensure that proxies are voted in the best economic interest of clients and in accordance with its fiduciary duties and local regulation this proxy voting policy and guidelines – am “policy and guidelines” shall apply to all accounts managed by us domiciled advisers and to all us client accounts managed by nonus regional offices nonus regional offices are required to maintain procedures and to vote proxies as may be required by law on behalf of their nonus clients in addition am’s proxy policies reflect the fiduciary standards and responsibilities for erisa accounts the attached guidelines represent a set of global recommendations that were determined by the global proxy voting subcommittee the “gpvsc” these guidelines were developed to provide am with a comprehensive list of recommendations that represent how am will generally vote proxies for its clients the recommendations derived from the application of these guidelines are not intended to influence the various am legal entities either directly or indirectly by parent or affiliated companies in addition the organizational structures and documents of the various am legal entities allows where necessary or appropriate the execution by individual am subsidiaries of the proxy voting rights independently of any db parent or affiliated company this applies in particular to nonus fund management companies the individuals that make proxy voting decisions are also free to act independently subject to the normal and customary supervision by the managementboards of these am legal entities    am’s proxy voting responsibilities proxy votes are the property of am’s advisory clients  as such am’s authority and responsibility to vote such proxies depend upon its contractual relationships with its clients or other delegated authority am has delegated responsibility for effecting its advisory clients’ proxy votes to institutional shareholder services “iss” an independent thirdparty proxy voting specialist iss votes am’s advisory clients’ proxies in accordance with am’s proxy guidelines or am’s specific instructions where a client has given specific instructions as to how a proxy should be voted am will notify iss to carry out those instructions where no specific instruction exists am will follow the procedures in voting the proxies set forth in this document certain tafthartley clients may direct am to have iss vote their proxies in accordance with taft hartley voting guidelines clients may in certain instances contract with their custodial agent and notify am that they wish to engage in securities lending transactions in such cases it is the responsibility of the custodian to deduct the number of shares that are on loan so that they do not get voted twice to the extent a security is out on loan and am determines that a proxy vote or other shareholder action is materially important to the client’s account am may request that the agent recall the security prior to the record date to allow am to vote the securities      for purposes of this document “clients” refers to persons or entities i for which am serves as investment adviser or subadviser ii for which am votes proxies and iii that have an economic or beneficial ownership interest in the portfolio securities of issuers soliciting such proxies      policies  proxy voting activities are conducted in the best economic interest of clients am has adopted the following policies and guidelines to ensure that proxies are voted in accordance with the best economic interest of its clients as determined by am in good faith after appropriate review    the global proxy voting subcommittee the global proxy voting subcommittee is an internal working group established by the applicable am’s investment risk oversight committee pursuant to a written charter the gpvsc is responsible for overseeing am’s proxy voting activities including   • adopting monitoring and updating guidelines attached as attachment a the “guidelines” that provide how am will generally vote proxies pertaining to a comprehensive list of common proxy voting matters • voting proxies where i the issues are not covered by specific client instruction or the guidelines ii the guidelines specify that the issues are to be determined on a casebycase basis or iii where an exception to the guidelines may be in the best economic interest of am’s clients and • monitoring proxy vendor oversight’s proxy voting activities see below am’s proxy vendor oversight a function of am’s operations group is responsible for coordinating with iss to administer am’s proxy voting process and for voting proxies in accordance with any specific client instructions or if there are none the guidelines and overseeing iss’ proxy responsibilities in this regard    availability of proxy voting policy and guidelines and proxy voting record copies of this policy as it may be updated from time to time is made available to clients as required by law and otherwise at am’s discretion clients may also obtain information on how their proxies were voted by am as required by law and otherwise at am’s discretion note however that am must not selectively disclose its investment company clients’ proxy voting records proxy vendor oversight will make proxy voting reports available to advisory clients upon request the investment companies’ proxy voting records will be disclosed to shareholders by means of publiclyavailable annual filings of each company’s proxy voting record for the month periods ending june  see section  below if so required by relevant law    procedures the key aspects of am’s proxy voting process are delineated below    the gpvsc’s proxy voting guidelines the guidelines set forth the gpvsc’s standard voting positions on a comprehensive list of common proxy voting matters the gpvsc has developed and continues to update the guidelines based on consideration of current corporate governance principles industry standards client feedback and the impact of the matter on issuers and the value of the investments the gpvsc will review the guidelines as necessary to support the best economic interests of am’s clients and in any event at least annually the gpvsc will make changes to the guidelines whether as a result of the annual review or otherwise taking solely into account the best economic interests of clients before changing the guidelines the gpvsc will thoroughly review and evaluate the proposed change and the reasons therefore and the gpvsc chair will ask gpvsc members whether anyone outside of the am organization but within deutsche bank and its affiliates or any entity that identifies itself as an am advisory client has requested or attempted to influence the proposed change and whether any member has a conflict of interest with respect to the proposed change if any such matter is reported to the gpvsc chair the chair will promptly notify the conflicts of interest management subcommittee see section  and will defer the approval if possible lastly the gpvsc will fully document its rationale for approving any change to the guidelines the guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices of the public companyies within the deutsche bank organization or of the investment companies for which am or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or sponsor investment companies particularly closedend investment companies are different from traditional operating companies these differences may call for differences in voting positions on the same matter further the manner in which am votes investment company proxies may differ from proposals for which an amadvised or sponsored investment company solicits proxies from its shareholders as reflected in the guidelines proxies solicited by closedend and openend investment companies are generally voted in accordance with the predetermined guidelines of iss funds “underlying funds” in which topiary fund management fund of funds each a “fund” invest may from time to time seek to revise their investment terms ie liquidity fees etc or investment structure in such event the underlying funds may require approvalconsent from its investors to effect the relevant changes topiary fund management has adopted proxy voting procedures which outline the process for these approvals    specific proxy voting decisions made by the gpvsc proxy vendor oversight will refer to the gpvsc all proxy proposals i that are not covered by specific client instructions or the guidelines or ii that according to the guidelines should be evaluated and voted on a casebycase basis additionally if proxy vendor oversight the gpvsc chair or any member of the gpvsc a portfolio manager a research analyst or a subadviser believes that voting a particular proxy in accordance with the guidelines may not be in the best economic interests of clients that individual may bring the matter to the attention of the gpvsc chair andor proxy vendor oversight  if proxy vendor oversight refers a proxy proposal to the gpvsc or the gpvsc determines that voting a particular proxy in accordance with the guidelines is not in the best economic interests of clients the gpvsc will evaluate and vote the proxy subject to the procedures below regarding conflicts the gpvsc endeavors to hold meetings to decide how to vote particular proxies sufficiently before the voting deadline so that the procedures below regarding conflicts can be completed before the gpvsc’s voting determination      proxy vendor oversight generally monitors upcoming proxy solicitations for heightened attention from the press or the industry and for novel or unusual proposals or circumstances which may prompt proxy vendor oversight to bring the solicitation to the attention of the gpvsc chair am portfolio managers am research analysts and subadvisers also may bring a particular proxy vote to the attention of the gpvsc chair as a result of their ongoing monitoring of portfolio securities held by advisory clients andor their review of the periodic proxy voting record reports that the gpvsc chair distributes to am portfolio managers and am research analysts      certain proxy votes may not be cast in some cases the gpvsc may determine that it is in the best economic interests of its clients not to vote certain proxies or that it may not be feasible to vote certain proxies if the conditions below are met with regard to a proxy proposal am will abstain from voting   • neither the guidelines nor specific client instructions cover an issue • iss does not make a recommendation on the issue and • the gpvsc cannot convene on the proxy proposal at issue to make a determination as to what would be in the client’s best interest this could happen for example if the conflicts of interest management subcommittee found that there was a material conflict or if despite all best efforts being made the gpvsc quorum requirement could not be met in addition it is am’s policy not to vote proxies of issuers subject to laws of those jurisdictions that impose restrictions upon selling shares after proxies are voted in order to preserve liquidity in other cases it may not be possible to vote certain proxies despite good faith efforts to do so for example some jurisdictions do not provide adequate notice to shareholders so that proxies may be voted on a timely basis voting rights on securities that have been loaned to thirdparties transfer to those thirdparties with loan termination often being the only way to attempt to vote proxies on the loaned securities lastly the gpvsc may determine that the costs to the clients associated with voting a particular proxy or group of proxies outweighs the economic benefits expected from voting the proxy or group of proxies proxy vendor oversight will coordinate with the gpvsc chair regarding any specific proxies and any categories of proxies that will not or cannot be voted the reasons for not voting any proxy shall be documented    conflict of interest procedures  procedures to address conflicts of interest and improper influence overriding principle in the limited circumstances where the gpvsc votes proxies   the gpvsc will vote those proxies in accordance with what it in good faith determines to be the best economic interests of am’s clients  independence of the gpvsc as a matter of compliance policy the gpvsc and proxy vendor oversight are structured to be independent from other parts of deutsche bank members of the gpvsc and the employee responsible for proxy vendor oversight are employees of am as such they may not be subject to the supervision or control of any employees of deutsche bank corporate and investment banking division “cib” their compensation cannot be based upon their contribution to any business activity outside of am without prior approval of legal and compliance they can have no contact with employees of deutsche bank outside of the private client and asset management division “pcam” regarding specific clients business matters or initiatives without the prior approval of legal and compliance they furthermore may not discuss proxy votes with any person outside of am and within am only on a need to know basis conflict review procedures the conflicts of interest management subcommittee within am monitors for potential material conflicts of interest in connection with proxy proposals that are to be evaluated by the gpvsc promptly upon a determination that a proxy vote shall be presented to the gpvsc the gpvsc chair shall notify the conflicts of interest management subcommittee the conflicts of interest management subcommittee shall promptly collect and review any information deemed reasonably appropriate to evaluate in its reasonable judgment if am or any person participating in the proxy voting process has or has the appearance of a material conflict of interest for the purposes of this policy a conflict of interest shall be considered “material” to the extent that a reasonable person could expect the conflict to influence or appear to influence the gpvsc’s decision on the particular vote at issue gpvsc should provide the conflicts of interest management subcommittee a reasonable amount of time no less than  hours to perform all necessary and appropriate reviews to the extent that a conflicts review cannot be sufficiently completed by the conflicts of interest management subcommittee the proxies will be voted in accordance with the standard guidelines the information considered by the conflicts of interest management subcommittee may include without limitation information regarding i am client relationships ii any relevant personal conflict known by the conflicts of interest management subcommittee or brought to the attention of that subcommittee and iii any communications with members of the gpvsc or anyone participating or providing information to the gpvsc and any person outside of the am organization but within deutsche bank and its affiliates or any entity that identifies itself as an am advisory client regarding the vote at issue in the context of any determination the conflicts of interest management subcommittee may consult with and shall be entitled to rely upon all applicable outside experts including legal counsel upon completion of the investigation the conflicts of interest management subcommittee will document its findings and conclusions if the conflicts of interest management subcommittee determines that i am has a material conflict of interest that would prevent it from deciding how to vote the proxies concerned without further client consent or ii certain individuals should be recused from participating in the proxy vote at issue the conflicts of interest management subcommittee will so inform the gpvsc chair if notified that am has a material conflict of interest as described above the gpvsc chair will obtain instructions as to how the proxies should be voted either from i if time permits the affected clients or ii in accordance with the standard guidelines if notified that certain individuals should be recused from the proxy vote at issue the gpvsc chair shall do so in accordance with the procedures set forth below      as mentioned above the gpvsc votes proxies where i neither a specific client instruction nor a guideline directs how the proxy should be voted ii where the guidelines specify that an issue is to be determined on a casebycase basis or iii where voting in accordance with the guidelines may not be in the best economic interests of clients  proxy vendor oversight who serves as the nonvoting secretary of the gpvsc may receive routine calls from proxy solicitors and other parties interested in a particular proxy vote any contact that attempts to exert improper pressure or influence shall be reported to the conflicts of interest management subcommittee note any am employee who becomes aware of a potential material conflict of interest in respect of any proxy vote to be made on behalf of clients shall notify compliance compliance shall call a meeting of the conflict review committee to evaluate such conflict and determine a recommended course of action procedures to be followed by the gpvsc at the beginning of any discussion regarding how to vote any proxy the gpvsc chair or his or her delegate will inquire as to whether any gpvsc member whether voting or ex officio or any person participating in the proxy voting process has a personal conflict of interest or has actual knowledge of an actual or apparent conflict that has not been reported to the conflicts of interest management subcommittee the gpvsc chair also will inquire of these same parties whether they have actual knowledge regarding whether any director officer or employee outside of the am organization but within deutsche bank and its affiliates or any entity that identifies itself as an am advisory client has i requested that am proxy vendor oversight or any member thereof or a gpvsc member vote a particular proxy in a certain manner ii attempted to influence am proxy vendor oversight or any member thereof a gpvsc member or any other person in connection with proxy voting activities or iii otherwise communicated with a gpvsc member or any other person participating or providing information to the gpvsc regarding the particular proxy vote at issue and which incident has not yet been reported to the conflicts of interest management subcommittee if any such incidents are reported to the gpvsc chair the chair will promptly notify the conflicts of interest management subcommittee and if possible will delay the vote until the conflicts of interest management subcommittee can complete the conflicts report if a delay is not possible the conflicts of interest management subcommittee will instruct the gpvsc i whether anyone should be recused from the proxy voting process or ii whether am should vote the proxy in accordance with the standard guidelines seek instructions as to how to vote the proxy at issue from iss or if time permits the effected clients these inquiries and discussions will be properly reflected in the gpvsc’s minutes duty to report any am employee including any gpvsc member whether voting or ex officio that is aware of any actual or apparent conflict of interest relevant to or any attempt by any person outside of the am organization but within deutsche bank and its affiliates or any entity that identifies itself as an am advisory client to influence how am votes its proxies has a duty to disclose the existence of the situation to the gpvsc chair or his or her designee and the details of the matter to the conflicts of interest management subcommittee in the case of any person participating in the deliberations on a specific vote such disclosure should be made before engaging in any activities or participating in any discussion pertaining to that vote recusal of members the gpvsc will recuse from participating in a specific proxy vote any gpvsc members whether voting or ex officio andor any other person who i are personally involved in a material conflict of interest or ii who as determined by the conflicts of interest management subcommittee have actual knowledge of a circumstance or fact that could affect their independent judgment in respect of such vote the gpvsc will also exclude from consideration the views of any person whether requested or volunteered if the gpvsc or any member thereof knows or if the conflicts of interest management subcommittee has determined that such other person has a material conflict of interest with respect to the particular proxy or has attempted to influence the vote in any manner prohibited by these policies if after excluding all relevant gpvsc voting members pursuant to the paragraph above there are three or more gpvsc voting members remaining those remaining gpvsc members will determine how to vote the proxy in accordance with these policy and guidelines if there are fewer than three gpvsc voting members remaining the gpvsc chair will vote the proxy in accordance with the standard guidelines or will obtain instructions as to how to have the proxy voted from if time permits the effected clients and otherwise from iss    investment companies and affiliated public companies investment companies as reflected in the guidelines all proxies solicited by openend and closedend investment companies are voted in accordance with the predetermined guidelines of iss unless the investment company client directs am to vote differently on a specific proxy or specific categories of proxies however regarding investment companies for which am or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or principal underwriter such proxies are voted in the same proportion as the vote of all other shareholders ie “mirror” or “echo” voting master fund proxies solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable provisions of section  of the investment company act of  “investment company act” subject to participation agreements with certain exchange traded funds “etfs” issuers that have received exemptive orders from the us securities and exchange commission “sec” allowing investing deutsche funds to exceed the limits set forth in section da and b of the investment company act am will echo vote proxies for etfs in which deutsche bank holds more than  of outstanding voting shares globally when required to do so by participation agreements and sec orders affiliated public companies for proxies solicited by noninvestment company issuers of or within the deutsche bank organization eg deutsche bank itself these proxies will be voted in the same proportion as the vote of other shareholders ie “mirror” or “echo” voting note with respect to the central cash management fund registered under the investment company act the fund is not required to engage in echo voting and the investment adviser will use these guidelines and may determine with respect to the central cash management fund to vote contrary to the positions in the guidelines consistent with the fund’s best interest    other procedures that limit conflicts of interest am and other entities in the deutsche bank organization have adopted a number of policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to avoid various conflicts of interest including those that may arise in connection with proxy voting including but not limited to   • code of business conduct and ethics  db group • conflicts of interest policy  db group • information sharing procedures – awm gtb  cbs • code of ethics – awm and • code of professional conduct – us the gpvsc

deutsche bank organization or of the investment companies for which am or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or sponsor note  because of the unique structure and regulatory scheme applicable to closedend investment companies the voting guidelines particularly those related to governance issues generally will be inapplicable to holdings of closedend investment companies as a result determinations on the appropriate voting recommendation for closedend investment company shares will be made on a casebycase basis   i board of directors and executives a election of directors routine am policy is to vote “for” the uncontested election of directors votes for a director in an uncontested election will be withheld in cases where a director has shown an inability to perform hisher duties in the best interests of the shareholders proxy contest in a proxy contest involving election of directors a casebycase voting decision will be made based upon analysis of the issues involved and the merits of the incumbent and dissident slates of directors am will incorporate the decisions of a third party proxy research vendor currently institutional shareholder services “iss” subject to review by the proxy voting subcommittee “gpvsc” as set forth in the am’s proxy voting policy and guidelines rationale  the large majority of corporate directors fulfill their fiduciary obligation and in most cases support for management’s nominees is warranted as the issues relevant to a contested election differ in each instance those cases must be addressed as they arise   b classified boards of directors am policy is to vote against proposals to classify the board and for proposals to repeal classified boards and elect directors annually rationale  directors should be held accountable on an annual basis by entrenching the incumbent board a classified board may be used as an antitakeover device to the detriment of the shareholders in a hostile takeover situation   c board and committee independence am policy is to vote    “for” proposals that require that a certain percentage majority up to   of members of a board of directors be comprised of independent or unaffiliated directors  “for” proposals that require all members of a companys compensation audit nominating or other similar committees be comprised of independent or unaffiliated directors  “against” shareholder proposals to require the addition of special interest or constituency representatives to boards of directors  “for” separation of the chairman and ceo positions  “against” proposals that require a company to appoint a chairman who is an independent director rationale  board independence is a cornerstone of effective governance and accountability a board that is sufficiently independent from management assures that shareholders interests are adequately represented however the chairman of the board must have sufficient involvement in and experience with the operations of the company to perform the functions required of that position and lead the company no director qualifies as “independent” unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed company either directly or as a partner shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company whether a director is in fact not “independent” will depend on the laws and regulations of the primary market for the security and the exchanges if any on which the security trades   d liability and indemnification of directors am policy is to vote “for” management proposals to limit directors liability and to broaden the indemnification of directors unless broader indemnification or limitations on directors liability would affect shareholders interests in pending litigation rationale  while shareholders want directors and officers to be responsible for their actions it is not in the best interests of the shareholders for them to be to risk averse if the risk of personal liability is too great companies may not be able to find capable directors willing to serve we support expanding coverage only for actions taken in good faith and not for serious violations of fiduciary obligation or negligence   e qualification of directors am policy is to follow management’s recommended vote on either management or shareholder proposals that set retirement ages for directors or require specific levels of stock ownership by directors rationale  as a general rule the board of directors and not the shareholders is most qualified to establish qualification policies   f removal of directors and filling of vacancies am policy is to vote “against” proposals that include provisions that directors may be removed only for cause or proposals that include provisions that only continuing directors may fill board vacancies rationale differing state statutes permit removal of directors with or without cause removal of directors for cause usually requires proof of selfdealing fraud or misappropriation of corporate assets limiting shareholders ability to remove directors except under extreme circumstances removal without cause requires no such showing allowing only incumbent directors to fill vacancies can serve as an antitakeover device precluding shareholders from filling the board until the next regular election   g proposals to fix the size of the board am policy is to vote    “for” proposals to fix the size of the board unless a no specific reason for the proposed change is given or b the proposal is part of a package of takeover defenses  “against” proposals allowing management to fix the size of the board without shareholder approval rationale  absent danger of antitakeover use companies should be granted a reasonable amount of flexibility in fixing the size of its board   h proposals to restrict chief executive officer’s service on multiple boards am policy is to vote “for” proposals to restrict a chief executive officer from serving on more than three outside boards of directors rationale  chief executive officer must have sufficient time to ensure that shareholders’ interests are represented adequately note  a director’s service on multiple closedend fund boards within a fund complex are treated as service on a single board for the purpose of the proxy voting guidelines   i proposals to restrict supervisory board members service on multiple boards am policy is to vote “for” proposals to restrict a supervisory board member from serving on more than five supervisory boards rationale  we consider a strong independent and knowledgeable supervisory board as important counterbalance to executive management to ensure that the interests of shareholders are fully reflected by the company full information should be disclosed in the annual reports and accounts to allow all shareholders to judge the success of the supervisory board controlling their company supervisory board members must have sufficient time to ensure that shareholders’ interests are represented adequately note  a director’s service on multiple closedend fund boards within a fund complex are treated as service on a single board for the purpose of the proxy voting guidelines   j proposals to establish audit committees am policy is to vote “for” proposals that require the establishment of audit committees rationale  the audit committee should deal with accounting and risk management related questions verifies the independence of the auditor with due regard to possible conflicts of interest it also should determine the procedure of the audit process   ii capital structure a authorization of additional shares am policy is to vote “for” proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of stock that do not exceed a  ratio of shares authorized to shares outstanding for a large cap company and do not exceed a  ratio of shares authorized to shares outstanding for a smallmidcap company companies having a market capitalization under one billion us dollars rationale  while companies need an adequate number of shares in order to carry on business increases requested for general financial flexibility must be limited to protect shareholders from their potential use as an antitakeover device requested increases for specifically designated reasonable business purposes stock split merger etc will be considered in light of those purposes and the number of shares required   b authorization of “blank check” preferred stock am policy is to vote    “against” proposals to create blank check preferred stock or to increase the number of authorized shares of blank check preferred stock unless the company expressly states that the stock will not be used for antitakeover purposes and will not be issued without shareholder approval  “for” proposals mandating shareholder approval of blank check stock placement rationale  shareholders should be permitted to monitor the issuance of classes of preferred stock in which the board of directors is given unfettered discretion to set voting dividend conversion and other rights for the shares issued   c stock splits  reverse stock splits am policy is to vote “for” stock splits if a legitimate business purpose is set forth and the split is in the shareholders best interests a vote is cast “for” a reverse stock split only if the number of shares authorized is reduced in the same proportion as the reverse split or if the effective increase in authorized shares relative to outstanding shares complies with the proxy guidelines for common stock increases rationale  generally stock splits do not detrimentally affect shareholders reverse stock splits however may have the same result as an increase in authorized shares and should be analyzed accordingly   d dual classsupervoting stock am policy is to vote “against” proposals to create or authorize additional shares of supervoting stock or stock with unequal voting rights rationale  the “one share one vote” principal ensures that no shareholder maintains a voting interest exceeding their equity interest in the company   e large block issuance am policy is to address large block issuances of stock on a casebycase basis incorporating the recommendation of an independent third party proxy research firm currently institutional shareholder services “iss” subject to review by the gpvsc as set forth in am’s proxy voting policy and guidelines additionally am supports proposals requiring shareholder approval of large block issuances rationale  stock issuances must be reviewed in light of the business circumstances leading to the request and the potential impact on shareholder value   f recapitalization into a single class of stock am policy is to vote “for” recapitalization plans to provide for a single class of common stock provided the terms are fair with no class of stock being unduly disadvantaged rationale  consolidation of multiple classes of stock is a business decision that may be left to the board andor management if there is no adverse effect on shareholders   g share repurchases am policy is to vote “for” share repurchase plans provided all shareholders are able to participate on equal terms rationale  buybacks are generally considered beneficial to shareholders because they tend to increase returns to the remaining shareholders   h reductions in par value am policy is to vote “for” proposals to reduce par value provided a legitimate business purpose is stated eg the reduction of corporate tax responsibility rationale  usually adjustments to par value are a routine financial decision with no substantial impact on shareholders   iii corporate governance issues a confidential voting am policy is to vote “for” proposals to provide for confidential voting and independent tabulation of voting results and to vote “against” proposals to repeal such provisions rationale  confidential voting protects the privacy rights of all shareholders this is particularly important for employeeshareholders or shareholders with business or other affiliations with the company who may be vulnerable to coercion or retaliation when opposing management confidential voting does not interfere with the ability of corporations to communicate with all shareholders nor does it prohibit shareholders from making their views known directly to management   b cumulative voting am policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals requesting cumulative voting and “for” management proposals to eliminate it the protections afforded shareholders by cumulative voting are not necessary when a company has a history of good performance and does not have a concentrated ownership interest accordingly a vote is cast “against” cumulative voting and “for” proposals to eliminate it if   a the company has a five year return on investment greater than the relevant industry index b all directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own less than  of the outstanding stock and c no shareholder or voting block beneficially owns  or more of the company thus failure of any one of the three criteria results in a vote for cumulative voting in accordance with the general policy rationale  cumulative voting is a tool that should be used to ensure that holders of a significant number of shares may have board representation however the presence of other safeguards may make their use unnecessary   c supermajority voting requirements am policy is to vote “against” management proposals to require a supermajority vote to amend the charter or bylaws and to vote “for” shareholder proposals to modify or rescind existing supermajority requirements    exception made when company holds a controlling position and seeks to lower threshold to maintain control andor make changes to corporate bylaws rationale  supermajority voting provisions violate the democratic principle that a simple majority should carry the vote setting supermajority requirements may make it difficult or impossible for shareholders to remove egregious bylaw or charter provisions occasionally a company with a significant insider held position might attempt to lower a supermajority threshold to make it easier for management to approve provisions that may be detrimental to shareholders in that case it may not be in the shareholders interests to lower the supermajority provision   d shareholder right to vote am policy is to vote “against” proposals that restrict the right of shareholders to call special meetings amend the bylaws or act by written consent am policy is to vote “for” proposals that remove such restrictions rationale  any reasonable means whereby shareholders can make their views known to management or affect the governance process should be supported   iv compensation annual incentive plans or bonus plans are often submitted to shareholders for approval these plans typically award cash to executives based on company performance deutsche bank believes that the responsibility for executive compensation decisions rest with the board of directors andor the compensation committee and its policy is not to secondguess the board’s award of cash compensation amounts to executives unless a particular award or series of awards is deemed excessive if stock options are awarded as part of these bonus or incentive plans the provisions must meet deutsche bank’s criteria regarding stock option plans or similar stockbased incentive compensation schemes as set forth below   a establishment of a remuneration committee am policy is to vote “for” proposals that require the establishment of a remuneration committee rationale  corporations should disclose in each annual report or proxy statement their policies on remuneration essential details regarding executive remuneration including share options longterm incentive plans and bonuses should be disclosed in the annual report so that investors can judge whether corporate pay policies and practices meet the standard the remuneration committee shall not comprise any board members and should be sensitive to the wider scene on executive pay it should ensure that performancebased elements of executive pay are designed to align the interests of shareholders   b executive and director stock option plans am policy is to vote “for” stock option plans that meet the following criteria    the resulting dilution of existing shares is less than a  of outstanding shares for large capital corporations or b  of outstanding shares for smallmid capital companies companies having a market capitalization under one billion us dollars  the transfer of equity resulting from granting options at less than fair market value “fmv” is no greater than  of the overall market capitalization of large capital corporations or  of market cap for smallmid capital companies  the plan does not contain express repricing provisions and in the absence of an express statement that options will not be repriced the company does not have a history of repricing options  the plan does not grant options on supervoting stock am will support performancebased option proposals as long as a they do not mandate that all options granted by the company must be performance based and b only certain highlevel executives are subject to receive the performance based options am will support proposals to eliminate the payment of outside director pensions rationale  determining the cost to the company and to shareholders of stockbased incentive plans raises significant issues not encountered with cashbased compensation plans these include the potential dilution of existing shareholders voting power the transfer of equity out of the company resulting from the grant and execution of options at less than fmv and the authority to reprice or replace underwater options our stock option plan analysis model seeks to allow reasonable levels of flexibility for a company yet still protect shareholders from the negative impact of excessive stock compensation acknowledging that small midcapital corporations often rely more heavily on stock option plans as their main source of executive compensation and may not be able to compete with their large capital competitors with cash compensation we provide slightly more flexibility for those companies   c employee stock optionpurchase plans am policy is to vote for employee stock purchase plans “espps” when the plan complies with internal revenue code section  allowing nonmanagement employees to purchase stock at  of fmv am policy is to vote “for” employee stock option plans “esops” provided they meet the standards for stock option plans in general however when computing dilution and transfer of equity esops are considered independently from executive and director option plans rationale  esops and espps encourage rankandfile employees to acquire an ownership stake in the companies they work for and have been shown to promote employee loyalty and improve productivity   d golden parachutes am policy is to vote “for” proposals to require shareholder approval of golden parachutes and for proposals that would limit golden parachutes to no more than three times base compensation am policy is to vote “against” more restrictive shareholder proposals to limit golden parachutes rationale  in setting a reasonable limitation am considers that an effective parachute should be less attractive than continued employment and that the irs has opined that amounts greater than three times annual salary are excessive   e proposals to limit benefits or executive compensation am policy is to vote “against”    proposals to limit benefits pensions or compensation and  proposals that request or require disclosure of executive compensation greater than the disclosure required by securities and exchange commission “sec” regulations rationale  levels of compensation and benefits are generally considered to be daytoday operations of the company and are best left unrestricted by arbitrary limitations proposed by shareholders   f option expensing am policy is to support proposals requesting companies to expense stock options rationale  although companies can choose to expense options voluntarily the financial accounting standards board “fasb” does not yet require it instead allowing companies to disclose the theoretical value of options as a footnote because the expensing of stock options lowers earnings most companies elect not to do so given the fact that options have become an integral component of compensation and their exercise results in a transfer of shareholder value am agrees that their value should not be ignored and treated as “no cost” compensation the expensing of stock options would promote more modest and appropriate use of stock options in executive compensation plans and present a more accurate picture of company operational earnings   g management board election and motion am policy is to vote “against”   • the election of board members with positions on either remuneration or audit committees • the election of supervisory board members with too many supervisory board mandates and • “automatic” election of former board members into the supervisory board rationale  management as an entity and each of its members are responsible for all actions of the company and are  subject to applicable laws and regulations  accountable to the shareholders as a whole for their actions sufficient information should be disclosed in the annual company report and account to allow shareholders to judge the success of the company   h remuneration variable pay executive remuneration for management board am policy is to vote “for” management board remuneration that is transparent and linked to results rationale  executive compensation should motivate management and align the interests of management with the shareholders the focus should be on criteria that prevent excessive remuneration but enable the company to hire and retain firstclass professionals shareholder interests are normally best served when management is remunerated to optimize longterm returns criteria should include suitable measurements like return on capital employed or economic value added interests should generally also be correctly aligned when management own shares in the company – even more so if these shares represent a substantial portion of their own wealth its disclosure shall differentiate between fixed pay variable performance related pay and longterm incentives including stock option plans with valuation ranges as well as pension and any other significant arrangements executive remuneration for supervisory board am policy is to vote “for” remuneration for supervisory board that is at least  in fixed form rationale  it would normally be preferable if performance linked compensation were not based on dividend payments but linked to suitable result based parameters consulting and procurement services should also be published in the company report   i longterm incentive plans am policy is to vote “for” longterm incentive plans for members of management boards that reward for above average company performance rationale  incentive plans will normally be supported if they   • directly align the interests of members of management boards with those of shareholders • establish challenging performance criteria to reward only above average performance • measure performance by total shareholder return in relation to the market or a range of comparable companies • are longterm in nature and encourage longterm ownership of the shares once exercised through minimum holding periods and • do not allow a repricing of the exercise price in stock option plans     j shareholder proposals concerning “pay for superior performance” am policy is to address pay for superior performance proposals on a casebycase basis incorporating the recommendation of an independent third party proxy research firm currently iss subject to review by the gpvsc as set forth in am’s proxy policy and guidelines rationale  while am agrees that compensation issues are better left to the discretion of management there remains the need to monitor for excessive compensation practices on a casebycase basis if after a review of the iss metrics am is comfortable with iss’s applying this calculation and will vote according to their recommendation   k executive compensation advisory am policy is to follow management’s recommended vote on shareholder proposals to propose an advisory resolution seeking to ratify the compensation of the company’s named executive officers “neos” on an annual basis rationale  am believes that controls exist within senior management and corporate compensation committees ensuring fair compensation to executives this might allow shareholders to require approval for all levels of management’s compensation   l advisory votes on executive compensation am policy is to evaluate executive compensation proposals on a casebycase basis where locally defined this may be done by incorporating the recommendation of an independent third party proxy research firm am will oppose advisory votes on executive compensation if    there is a significant misalignment between ceo pay and company performance  the company maintains significant problematic pay practices andor  the board exhibits a significant level of poor communication and responsiveness to shareholders rationale  while am agrees that compensation issues are better left to the discretion of management there remains a need to take action on this nonbinding proposal if excessive compensation practices exist   m frequency of advisory vote on executive compensation am policy is to vote “for” annual advisory votes on compensation which provide the most consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns about companies’ executive pay programs rationale  am believes that annual advisory vote gives shareholders the opportunity to express any compensation concerns to the executive compensation proposal which is an advisory voting   v antitakeover related issues a sha reho lder rights plans “poison pills” am policy is to vote “for” proposals to require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that request boards to redeem poison pills and to vote “against” the adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder ratification rationale  poison pills are the most prevalent form of corporate takeover defenses and can be and usually are adopted without shareholder review or consent the potential cost of poison pills to shareholders during an attempted takeover outweighs the benefits   b reincorporation am policy is to examine reincorporation proposals on a casebycase basis the voting decision is based on    differences in state law between the existing state of incorporation and the proposed state of incorporation and  differences between the existing and the proposed charterbylawsarticles of incorporation and their effect on shareholder rights   if changes resulting from the proposed reincorporation violate the corporate governance principles set forth in these guidelines the reincorporation will be deemed contrary to shareholder’s interests and a vote cast “against” rationale  reincorporations can be properly analyzed only by looking at the advantages and disadvantages to their shareholders care must be taken that antitakeover protection is not the sole or primary result of a proposed change   c fairprice proposals am policy is to vote “for” management fairprice proposals provided that    the proposal applies only to twotier offers  the proposal sets an objective fairprice test based on the highest price that the acquirer has paid for a companys shares  the supermajority requirement for bids that fail the fairprice test is no higher than twothirds of the outstanding shares and  the proposal contains no other antitakeover provisions or provisions that restrict shareholders rights a vote is cast for shareholder proposals that would modify or repeal existing fairprice requirements that do not meet these standards rationale  while fair price provisions may be used as antitakeover devices if adequate provisions are included they provide some protection to shareholders who have some say in their application and the ability to reject those protections if desired   d exemption from state takeover laws am policy is to vote “for” shareholder proposals to opt out of state takeover laws and to vote “against” management proposals requesting to opt out of state takeover laws rationale  control share statutes enacted at the state level may harm longterm share value by entrenching management they also unfairly deny certain shares their inherent voting rights   e nonfinancial effects of takeover bids policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals to require consideration of nonfinancial effects of merger or acquisition proposals rationale  nonfinancial effects may often be subjective and are secondary to am’s stated purpose of acting in its client’s best economic interest   vi mergers  acquisitions evaluation of mergers acquisitions and other special corporate transactions ie takeovers spinoffs sales of assets reorganizations restructurings and recapitalizations are performed on a casebycase basis incorporating information from an independent proxy research source currently iss additional resources including portfolio management and research analysts may be considered as set forth in am’s policies and procedures   vii environmental social and governance issues environmental social and governance issues esg are becoming increasingly important to corporate success we incorporate esg considerations into both our investment decisions and our proxy voting decisions – particularly if the financial performance of the company could be impacted companies or states that seriously contravene internationally accepted ethical principles will be subject to heightened scrutiny   a principles for responsible investment am policy is to actively engage with companies on esg issues and participate in esg initiatives in this context am a votes “for” increased disclosure on esg issues b is willing to participate in the development of policy regulation and standard setting such as promoting and protecting shareholder rights c could support shareholder initiatives and also file shareholder resolutions with long term esg considerations and improved esg disclosure when applicable d could support standardized esg reporting and issues to be integrated within annual financial reports and e on a casebycase basis will generally follow management’s recommended vote on other matters related to esg issues rationale  esg issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios to varying degrees across companies sectors regions asset classes and through time   b esg issues am policy is to vote in line with the coalition for environmentally responsible economies “ceres” recommendation on environmental matters contained in the ceres principles and the recommendations on social and sustainability issues not specifically addressed elsewhere in these guidelines am will rely on iss to identify shareholder proposals addressing ceres principles and proxies will be voted in accordance with isss predetermined voting guidelines on ceres principles any matter that is to be voted on consented to or approved by the voting members may take place in person telephonically or via other electronic means in addition voting members may act in writing including without limitation via email rationale  am supports the ceres principles and as such generally votes proxies in line with the ceres recommendation   c labor and human rights am policy is to vote “against” adopting global codes of conduct or workplace standards exceeding those mandated by law rationale  additional requirements beyond those mandated by law are deemed unnecessary and potentially burdensome to companies   d diversity and equality  am policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals to force equal employment opportunity affirmative action or board diversity rationale  compliance with state and federal legislation along with information made available through filings with the equal employment opportunity commission “eeoc” provides sufficient assurance that companies act responsibly and make information public    am policy is also to vote “against” proposals to adopt the macbride principles the macbride principles promote fair employment specifically regarding religious discrimination rationale  compliance with the fair employment act of  makes adoption of the macbride principles redundant their adoption could potentially lead to charges of reverse discrimination   e health and safety  am policy is to vote “against” adopting a pharmaceutical price restraint policy or reporting pricing policy changes rationale  pricing is an integral part of business for pharmaceutical companies and should not be dictated by shareholders particularly pursuant to an arbitrary formula disclosing pricing policies may also jeopardize a company’s competitive position in the marketplace    am policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals to control the use or labelling of and reporting on genetically engineered products rationale  additional requirements beyond those mandated by law are deemed unnecessary and potentially burdensome to companies   f governmentmilitary  am policy is to vote against shareholder proposals regarding the production or sale of military arms or nuclear or spacebased weapons including proposals seeking to dictate a companys interaction with a particular foreign country or agency rationale  generally management is in a better position to determine what products or industries a company can and should participate in regulation of the production or distribution of military supplies is or should be a matter of government policy    am

management not shareholders should evaluate and determine the recipients of any contributions made by the company   g tobacco  am policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals requesting additional standards or reporting requirements for tobacco companies as well as “against” requesting companies to report on the intentional manipulation of nicotine content rationale  where a tobacco company’s actions meet the requirements of legal and industry standards imposing additional burdens may detrimentally affect a companys ability to compete the disclosure of nicotine content

more appropriately left to the board and management and not to shareholder mandate   viii miscellaneous items a ratification of auditors am policy is to vote “for” a the management recommended selection of auditors and b proposals to require shareholder approval of auditors rationale  absent evidence that auditors have not performed their duties adequately support for management’s nomination is warranted   b limitation of nonaudit services provided by independent auditor am policy is to support proposals limiting nonaudit fees to  of the aggregate annual fees earned by the firm retained as a companys independent auditor rationale  in the wake of financial reporting problems and alleged audit failures at a number of companies am supports the general principle that companies should retain separate firms for audit and consulting services to avoid potential conflicts of interest however given the protections afforded by the sarbanesoxley act of  which requires audit committee preapproval for nonaudit services and prohibits auditors from providing specific types of services and the fact that some nonaudit services are legitimate auditrelated services complete separation of audit and consulting fees may not be warranted a reasonable limitation is appropriate to help ensure auditor independence and it is reasonable to expect that audit fees exceed nonaudit fees   c audit firm rotation am policy is to vote against proposals seeking audit firm rotation rationale  while the sarbanesoxley act mandates that the lead audit partner be switched every five years am believes that rotation of the actual audit firm would be costly and disruptive   d transaction of other business am policy is to vote “against” transaction of other business proposals rationale  this is a routine item to allow shareholders to raise other issues and discuss them at the meeting as the nature of these issues may not be disclosed prior to the meeting we recommend a vote against

sufficient opportunity to consider   e motions to adjourn the meeting am policy is to vote “against” proposals to adjourn the meeting rationale  management may seek authority to adjourn the meeting if a favorable outcome is not secured shareholders should already have had enough information to make a decision once votes have been cast there is no justification for management to continue spending time and money to press shareholders for support   f bundled proposals am policy is to vote against bundled proposals if any bundled issue would require a vote against it if proposed individually rationale  shareholders should not be forced to “take the good with the bad” in cases where the proposals could reasonably have been submitted separately   g change of company name am policy is to support management on proposals to change the company name rationale  this is generally considered a business decision for a company   h proposals related to the annual meeting am policy is to vote “for” management for proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting meeting time place etc rationale  these are considered routine administrative proposals   i reimbursement of expenses incurred from candidate nomination am policy is to follow management’s recommended vote on shareholder proposals related to the amending of company bylaws to provide for the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with nominating one or more candidates in a contested election of directors to the corporation’s board of directors rationale  corporations should not be liable for costs associated with shareholder proposals for directors   j investment company proxies proxies solicited by investment companies are voted in accordance with the recommendations of an

the manner in which am votes investment company proxies may differ from proposals for which an amadvised investment company solicits proxies from its shareholders as reflected in the guidelines

interest and that among other things imposes restrictions on the ability of portfolio managers and other “access persons” to invest in securities that may be recommended or traded in the funds and other client accounts   real potential or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager has daytoday portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund or account including the following   · certain investments may be appropriate for the fund and also for other clients advised by the advisor including other client accounts managed by the fund’s portfolio management team investment decisions for the fund and other clients are made with a view to achieving their respective investment objectives and after consideration of such factors as their current holdings availability of cash for investment and the size of their investments generally a particular security may be bought or sold for only one client or in different amounts and at different times for more than one but less than all clients likewise because clients of the advisor may have differing investment strategies a particular security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling the security the investment results achieved for the fund may differ from the results achieved for other clients of the advisor in addition purchases or sales of the same security may be made for two or more clients on the same day in such event such transactions will be allocated among the clients in a manner believed by the advisor to be most equitable to each client generally utilizing a pro rata allocation methodology in some cases the allocation procedure could potentially have an adverse effect or positive effect on the price or amount of the securities purchased or sold by the fund purchase and sale orders for the fund may be combined with those of other clients of the advisor in the interest of achieving the most favorable net results to the fund and the other clients · to the extent that a portfolio manager has responsibilities for managing multiple client accounts a portfolio manager will need to divide time and attention among relevant accounts the advisor attempts to minimize these conflicts by aligning its portfolio management teams by investment strategy and by employing similar investment models across multiple client accounts · in some cases an apparent conflict may arise where the advisor has an incentive such as a performancebased fee in managing one account and not with respect to other accounts it manages the advisor will not determine allocations based on whether it receives a performancebased fee from the client additionally the advisor has in place supervisory oversight processes to periodically monitor performance deviations for accounts with like strategies · the advisor and its affiliates and the investment team of each fund may manage other mutual funds and separate accounts on a long only or a longshort basis the simultaneous management of long and short portfolios creates potential conflicts of interest including the risk that short sale activity could adversely affect the market value of the long positions and vice versa the risk arising from sequential orders in long and short positions and the risks associated with receiving opposing orders at the same time the advisor has adopted procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to mitigate these and other potential conflicts of interest included in these procedures are specific guidelines developed to provide fair and equitable treatment for all clients whose accounts are managed by each fund’s portfolio management team the advisor and the portfolio management team have established monitoring procedures a protocol for supervisory reviews as well as compliance oversight to ensure that potential conflicts of interest relating to this type of activity are properly addressed the advisor is owned by deutsche bank ag a multinational financial services company therefore the advisor is affiliated with a variety of entities that provide andor engage in commercial banking insurance brokerage investment banking financial advisory brokerdealer activities including sales and trading hedge funds real estate and private equity investing in addition to the provision of investment management services to institutional and individual investors since deutsche bank ag its affiliates directors officers and employees the “firm” are engaged in businesses and have interests in addition to managing asset management accounts such wide ranging activities involve real potential or apparent conflicts of interest these interests and activities include potential advisory transactional and financial activities and other interests in securities and companies that may be directly or indirectly purchased or sold by the firm for its clients’ advisory accounts the advisor may take investment positions in securities in which other clients or related persons within the firm have different investment positions there may be instances in which the advisor is purchasing or selling for its client accounts or pursuing an outcome in the context of a workout or restructuring with respect to securities in which the firm is undertaking the same or differing strategy in other businesses or other client accounts these are considerations of which advisory clients should be aware and which may cause conflicts that could be to the disadvantage of the advisor’s advisory clients including the

financial officer code of ethics “officer code” sets forth the policies practices and values expected to be exhibited in the conduct of the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of the investment companies “funds” they serve “covered officers”  a list of covered officers and funds is included on appendix a the boards of the funds listed on appendix a have elected to implement the officer code pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  and the sec’s rules thereunder to promote and demonstrate honest and ethical conduct in their covered officers deutsche asset  wealth management or its affiliates “deawm” serves as the investment adviser to each fund  all covered officers are also employees of deawm or an affiliate  thus in addition to adhering to the officer code these individuals must comply with deawm policies and procedures such as the deawm code of ethics governing personal trading activities as adopted pursuant to rule j under the investment company act of     in addition such individuals also must comply with other applicable fund policies and procedures the deawm compliance officer who shall not be a covered officer and who shall serve as such subject to the approval of the fund’s board or committee thereof is primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing this code  the compliance officer has the authority to interpret this officer code and its applicability to particular circumstances any questions about the officer code should be directed to the deawm compliance officer the deawm compliance officer and his or her contact information can be found in appendix a    the obligations imposed by the officer code are separate from and in addition to any obligations imposed under codes of ethics adopted pursuant to rule j under the investment company act of  and any other code of conduct applicable to covered officers in whatever capacity they serve  the officer code does not incorporate any of those other codes and accordingly violations of those codes will not necessarily be considered violations of the officer code and waivers granted under those codes would not necessarily require a waiver to be granted under this code  sanctions imposed under those codes may be considered in determining appropriate sanctions for any violation of this code   ii   purposes of the officer code   the purposes of the officer code are to deter wrongdoing and to ·   promote honest and ethical conduct among covered officers including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships ·   promote full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosures in reports and documents that the funds file with or submit to the sec and in other public communications from the funds and that are within the covered officer’s responsibilities ·   promote compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations ·   encourage the prompt internal reporting of violations of the officer code to the deawm compliance officer and ·   establish accountability for adherence to the officer code any questions about the officer code should be referred to deawm’s compliance officer   iii   responsibilities of covered officers     a   honest and ethical conduct   it is the duty of every covered officer to encourage and demonstrate honest and ethical conduct as well as adhere to and require adherence to the officer code and any other applicable policies and procedures designed to promote this behavior  covered officers must at all times conduct themselves with integrity and distinction putting first the interests of the funds they serve   covered officers must be honest and candid while maintaining confidentiality of information where required by law deawm policy or fund policy covered officers also must at all times act in good faith responsibly and with due care competence and diligence without misrepresenting or being misleading about material facts or allowing their independent judgment to be subordinated  covered officers also should maintain skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of their duties for the funds  covered officers also must responsibly use and control all fund assets and resources entrusted to them covered officers may not retaliate against others for or otherwise discourage the reporting of actual or apparent violations of the officer code or applicable laws or regulations  covered officers should create an environment that encourages the exchange of information including concerns of the type that this code is designed to address     b   conflicts of interest   a “conflict of interest” occurs when a covered officer’s personal interests interfere with the interests of the fund for which he or she serves as an officer covered officers may not improperly use their position with a fund for personal or private gain to themselves their family or any other person  similarly covered officers may not use their personal influence or personal relationships to influence decisions or other fund business or operational matters where they would benefit personally at the fund’s expense or to the fund’s detriment  covered officers may not cause the fund to take action or refrain from taking action for their personal benefit at the fund’s expense or to the fund’s detriment  some examples of conflicts of interest follow this is not an allinclusive list  being in the position of supervising reviewing or having any influence on the job evaluation pay or benefit of any immediate family member who is an employee of a fund service provider or is otherwise associated with the fund or having an ownership interest in or having any consulting or employment relationship with any fund service provider other than deawm or its affiliates   certain conflicts of interest covered by this code arise out of the relationships between covered officers and the fund that already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the investment company act and the investment advisers act  for example covered officers may not individually engage in certain transactions such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property with the fund because of their status as “affiliated persons” of the fund  covered officers must comply with applicable laws and regulations therefore any violations of existing statutory and regulatory prohibitions on individual behavior could be considered a violation of this code as to conflicts arising from or as a result of the advisory relationship or any other relationships between the fund and deawm of which the covered officers are also officers or employees it is recognized by the board that subject to deawm’s fiduciary duties to the fund the covered officers will in the normal course of their duties whether formally for the fund or for deawm or for both be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different effects on deawm and the fund  the board recognizes that the participation of the covered officers in such activities is inherent in the contract relationship between the fund and deawm and is consistent with the expectation of the board of the performance by the covered officers of their duties as officers of the fund covered officers should avoid actual conflicts of interest and appearances of conflicts of interest between the covered officer’s duties to the fund and his or her personal interests beyond those contemplated or anticipated by applicable regulatory schemes  if a covered officer suspects or knows of a conflict or an appearance of one the covered officer must immediately report the matter to the deawm compliance officer  if a covered officer in lieu of reporting such a matter to the deawm compliance officer may report the matter directly to the fund’s board or committee thereof as appropriate eg if the conflict involves the deawm compliance officer or the covered officer reasonably believes it would be futile to report the matter to the deawm compliance officer when actual apparent or suspected conflicts of interest arise in connection with a covered officer deawm personnel aware of the matter should promptly contact the deawm compliance officer  there will be no reprisal or retaliation against the person reporting the matter upon receipt of a report of a possible conflict the deawm compliance officer will take steps to determine whether a conflict exists  in so doing the deawm compliance officer may take any actions he or she determines to be appropriate in his or her sole discretion and may use all reasonable resources including retaining or engaging legal counsel accounting firms or other consultants subject to applicable law    the costs associated with such actions may be borne by the fund if appropriate after consultation with the fund’s board or committee thereof  otherwise such costs will be borne by deawm or other appropriate fund service provider after full review of a report of a possible conflict of interest the deawm compliance officer may determine that no conflict or reasonable appearance of a conflict exists  if however the deawm compliance officer determines that an actual conflict exists the compliance officer will resolve the conflict solely in the interests of the fund and will report the conflict and its resolution to the fund’s board or committee thereof  if the deawm compliance officer determines that the appearance of a conflict exists the deawm compliance officer will take appropriate steps to remedy such appearance  in lieu of determining whether a conflict exists andor resolving a conflict the deawm compliance officer instead may refer the matter to the fund’s board or committee thereof as appropriate  however the deawm compliance officer must refer the matter to the fund’s board or committee thereof if the deawm compliance officer is directly involved in the conflict or under similar appropriate circumstances after responding to a report of a possible conflict of interest the deawm compliance officer will discuss the matter with the person reporting it and with the covered officer at issue if different for purposes of educating those involved on conflicts of interests including how to detect and avoid them if appropriate appropriate resolution of conflicts may restrict the personal activities of the covered officer andor his family friends or other persons solely because a conflict is disclosed to the deawm compliance officer andor the board or committee thereof andor resolved by the deawm compliance officer does not mean that the conflict or its resolution constitutes a waiver from the code’s requirements any questions about conflicts of interests including whether a particular situation might be a conflict or an appearance of one should be directed to the deawm compliance officer     for example retaining a fund’s independent accounting firm may require preapproval by the fund’s audit committee   c   use of personal fund shareholder information   a covered officer may not use or disclose personal information about fund shareholders except in the performance of his or her duties for the fund  each covered officer also must abide by the funds’ and deawm’s privacy policies under sec regulation sp   d   public communications   in connection with his or her responsibilities for or involvement with a fund’s public communications and disclosure documents eg shareholder reports registration statements press releases each covered officer must provide information to fund service providers within the deawm organization or otherwise and to the fund’s board and any committees thereof independent auditors government regulators and selfregulatory organizations that is fair accurate complete objective relevant timely and understandable further within the scope of their duties covered officers having

timely accurate and understandable disclosure in fund disclosure documents  such covered officers will oversee or appoint others to oversee processes for the timely and accurate creation and review of all public reports and regulatory filings  within the scope of his or her responsibilities as a covered officer each covered officer also will familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the fund as well as the business and financial operations of the fund  each covered officer also will adhere to and will promote adherence to applicable disclosure controls processes and procedures including deawm’s disclosure controls and procedures which govern the process by which fund disclosure documents are created and reviewed to the extent that covered officers participate in the creation of a fund’s books or records they must do so in a way that promotes the accuracy fairness and timeliness of those records   e   compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations   in connection with his or her duties and within the scope of his or her responsibilities as a covered officer each covered officer must comply with governmental laws rules and regulations accounting standards and fund policiesprocedures that apply to his or her role responsibilities and duties with respect to the funds “applicable laws” these requirements do not impose on covered officers any additional substantive duties additionally covered officers should promote compliance with applicable laws if a covered officer knows of any material violations of applicable laws or suspects that such a violation may have occurred the covered officer is expected to promptly report the matter to the deawm compliance officer   iv   violation reporting   a   overview   each covered officer must promptly report to the deawm compliance officer and promote the reporting of any known or suspected violations of the officer code  failure to report a violation may be a violation of the officer code examples of violations of the officer code include but are not limited to the following ·   unethical or dishonest behavior ·   obvious lack of adherence to policies surrounding review and approval of public communications and regulatory filings ·   failure to report violations of the officer code ·   known or obvious deviations from applicable laws ·   failure to

board members  the compliance officer also has the authority to use all reasonable resources to investigate violations including retaining or engaging legal counsel accounting firms or other consultants subject to applicable law  the costs associated with such actions may be borne by the fund if appropriate after consultation with the fund’s board or committee thereof  otherwise such costs will be borne by deawm  for example retaining a fund’s independent accounting firm may require preapproval by the fund’s audit committee     b   how to report   any known or suspected violations

website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i
