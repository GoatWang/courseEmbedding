nasdaqkmph english français register sign in kempharm strengthens adhd prodrug pipeline with development of kp a new superextended release adhd methylphenidate product candidate june    et  source kempharm kp endofphase  meeting with fda affirms kempharm’s development plan and potential nda submission as early as late  conference call and live audio webcast with slide presentation scheduled for today at  pm et coralville iowa june   globe newswire  kempharm inc nasdaqkmph a clinicalstage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs today announced two significant advances involving its prodrug development pipeline for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd  these advances include the development of a new prodrug product candidate of dthreomethylphenidate dmph kp for adhd indications that may benefit from a superextended duration of treatment and the successful completion of an endofphase  eop meeting with the us food and drug administration fda for kp kp – prodrug of dmph for superextended duration treatment of adhdkp is kempharm’s newly developed prodrug product candidate for a superextended release ser dmph being designed for the treatment of adhd in patients that respond best when a long duration of therapy beyond both kp and all current methylphenidate treatments is required  the new therapeutic application was developed during a data analysis of the kp phase  study in which kempharm observed that the prodrug molecule demonstrated an ability to produce a longer duration release of dmph relative to comparator products available on the market today  as a result kempharm is now planning to initiate development of kp and anticipates filing an investigational new drug ind application for kp as early as the third quarter of   kempharm expects to leverage data from certain clinical and nonclinical trials of kp to expedite the development of kp kempharm believes that this may enable it to realize key cost and rd efficiencies and target a new drug application nda submission as soon as  kp – prodrug of dmph for treatment of adhd with early onset and better total durationkp is kempharm’s extended release er dmph prodrug product candidate designed for the treatment of adhd with patients that could benefit from both earlier onset as well as better total duration of effect  as previously indicated kempharm held an eop meeting with the fda to discuss the data from the phase  proofofconcept clinical trial of kp kp additional nonclinical and manufacturing data sets and the proposed clinical and nonclinical programs required for eventual submission of an nda for kp  additionally kempharm and the fda discussed the proposed commercial formulation of kp which kempharm plans to develop with a layer of methylphenidate to potentially support a superior early onset profile  based on the feedback from the fda kempharm believes that its ongoing and anticipated research of kp including the pivotal efficacy trial which kempharm plans to initiate in the second half of  remains on schedule and in alignment with an nda submission as soon as late   kempharm also anticipates that it will initiate a human abuse liability hal program of kp beginning in the second half of  to assess the potential for the prodrug to deter intranasal intravenous and oral abuse  kempharm expects data from the hal program and the ongoing pharmacokinetic pk studies will be available in the second half of  and early   kempharm plans to utilize the data from both studies in the development kp as well “we now believe kempharm’s adhd prodrug portfolio is the company’s most valuable asset in our view the advances that we have made with kp and our newly developed product candidate for a super extended treatment kp further support this belief” stated travis c mickle phd president and chief executive officer of kempharm  “we continue to view kp as our highest value product candidate and we are excited to now take this prodrug to the next phase of its development since our quarterly update in may we have initiated several pharmacokinetic studies of kp with data from these studies expected during the second half of  and in early  now following the endofphase  meeting with the fda we are prepared to develop the commercial formulation of kp and initiate the pivotal efficacy study and human abuse liability program for kp in the second half of  all pointing towards an nda submission for kp as soon as late ” “the success of our kp program is now heightened by the development of a new product we are designating as kp which we are planning to develop for patients that require a product that provides a much longer duration of treatment for their adhd” dr mickle continued  “in contrast to shire’s recently approved amphetaminebased mydayistm for extended duration of treatment for adhd initial clinical data on kp suggest our new methylphenidate product could offer substantially longer duration when compared to other methylphenidate adhd drugs which is clearly an unmet need in treatment with methylphenidate given this we have now activated the development program for kp with our first milestone being an ind filing in the third quarter” “we believe physicians need products such as kp and kp which are designed to provide solutions for their patients’ individual needs recognizing that many may respond differently to different treatments  thus it is important for patients to have multiple treatment options” dr mickle concluded  “for example some patients need milder therapies such as a methylphenidatebased option that may be just as effective and have fewer side effects when compared to amphetaminebased products” conference call
