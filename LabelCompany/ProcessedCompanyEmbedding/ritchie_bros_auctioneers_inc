ritchie brothersedit ritchie bros auctioneers was established in kelowna bc canada the three ritchie brothers – ken john and dave ritchie – took over the ok used furniture store from their father in  they entered the auction business in  when they needed ca to pay a bank debt on short notice a friend suggested they conduct an auction to get rid of some surplus inventory from the furniture store they conducted their first auction at the scout hall in kelowna in  and discovered a new way of doing business starting with that first auction at the scout hall ritchie bros maintained a strict policy of conducting unreserved auctions – meaning there were no minimum bids and no reserve prices the brothers also established a policy of not allowing bidins or buybacks by the sellers the brothers began conducting auctions more regularly and in  incorporated ritchie bros auction galleries ltd to formalize their new business ritchie bros began selling used equipment in the s in  dave ritchie moved to vancouver bc and rented an auction site on se marine drive he set up the companys first equipment auction in vancouver shortly after the ritchie brothers conducted their first major unreserved industrial auction in radium hot springs british columbia on june   they sold ca of equipment in one day – by far the largest auction in the companys history the success of the radium hot springs auction convinced the brothers that they could make more money auctioning used equipment than selling furniture so they sold their furniture store in kelowna and went into the auction business fulltime ritchie bros auctioneers established one of the trademarks of its auctions at the radium hot springs auction it was raining on the day of the auction instead of making the bidders walk around in the rain during the auction they set up the auction under the eaves of a nearby shop and drove the equipment in to be sold piece by piece the crowd stayed dry and the rampandstage method became a fixture at ritchie bros auctions thereafter  years of unreserved industrial auctionsedit on june   ritchie bros celebrated  years since the company’s first major unreserved industrial auction in radium hot springs british columbia it was at this radium hot springs auction that ritchie bros adopted the rampandstage approach for selling all mobile equipment this approach involves a staging area —designed as a ramp— located in front of a viewing theater where bidders sit waiting for mobile equipment to come to “center stage” each piece of equipment is numbered and once it comes to rest at the center of the ramp the auctioneer begins asking for bids the crowd of bidders signals their bid increments to roving “bid catchers” who in turn signal the auctioneer when a bid is made the auctioneer increases the call price until there are no more bids being placed at a ritchie bros auction bids are called until no more are forthcoming in approximately one minute when the auctioneer calls that the item has been “sold” to the highest bidder the company has pioneered the rampandstage method and unreserved industrial auctions around the world ever since the auction at radium hot springs on june   the early auction yearsedit most of the companys earliest auctions were held in british columbia ritchie bros began expanding into other parts of canada in the mids conducting its first
