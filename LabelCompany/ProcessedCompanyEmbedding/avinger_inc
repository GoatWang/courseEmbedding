action lawsuit against avinger inc may   rosen law firm announced the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of avinger inc in or traceable to avinger’s january   initial public offering the lawsuit seeks to recover damages for avinger investors under the federal securities laws according to the lawsuit the documents filed in connection with the ipo contained materially false and misleading statements andor failed to disclose that avinger did not have adequate sales and marketing personnel to increase sales of its lumivascular platform products and to commercialize pantheris avinger had already experienced problems with the robustness of its lumivascular platform devices including pantheris physicians and hospitals were requiring more extensive and comprehensive training and education on the benefits of avinger’s products to convince them to adopt and implement avinger’s lumivascular platform products compared to competing products and procedures available in the market in turn avinger would not be able to achieve a rapid ramp rate for increased sales of its lumivascular platform and as a result avinger was experiencing lower sales and revenues when the true details entered the market the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages similar private companies by industry company name region decimal inc united states

imageguided catheterbased systems that are used by physicians to treat patients with peripheral arterial disease pad the company focuses on introducing products based on its lumivascular platform which is an intravascular imageguided system the company manufactures and sells a suite of products in the united states and select european markets the companys products include lightbox imaging console as well as its wildcat kittycat and the ocelot family of catheters which are designed to allow physicians to penetrate a total blockage in an artery known as a chronic total occlusion cto the lumivascular platform offers realtime visualization of the inside of the artery during pad treatment the lumivascular platform consists of a capital component lightbox and a range of disposable catheter products including ocelot ocelot pixl ocelot mvrx and pantheristhe company is developing pantheris its imageguided atherectomy device which is designed to allow physicians to remove arterial plaque in pad patients the company has completed enrollment of over  patients in vision a clinical trial for its pantheris atherectomy device the companys products include lightbox console and various catheters used in pad treatment the lumivascular platform integrates optical coherence tomography oct visualization with interventional catheters and provides realtime intravascular imaging during the treatment portion of pad procedureslightboxlightbox is an imaging console which enables the use of lumivascular catheters during pad procedures the console contains an optical transceiver that transmits light into the artery through an optical fiber and displays a crosssectional image of the vascular tissue to the physician on a monitor during the procedure lightbox is configured with monitors for the physicians and for the lightbox technician lightbox displays a crosssectional view of the vessel which provides physicians with detailed information about the orientation of the catheter and the surrounding artery and plaque layered structures represent relatively healthy portions of the artery and nonlayered structures represent the plaque that is blocking blood flow in the artery navigational markers allow the physician to orient the catheter toward the treatment area helping to avoid damage to the black line during a procedurepantherispantheris is a singleuse product and provides physicians with the ability to see a crosssectional view of the artery throughout the procedure the device restores blood flow by shaving thin strips of plaque using a directional cutting mechanism that specifically targets the portion of the artery where the plaque resides while minimizing disruption to the arterial structures the excised plaque is deposited in the nosecone of the device and removed from the artery the physicians advance pantheris to the diseased portion of the vessel using fluoroscopy prior to activating the cutting tip the oct image provides the physician with a crosssectional view of the treatment site and the relative orientation of the cutter visual cues are used to orient the cutting mechanism to target diseased sections of the artery and the plaque is removed by activating the cutter and advancing the catheter through the blockage a balloon beneath the cutter is inflated to move the catheter closer to the plaque enabling the physician to stabilize the device and adjust the cut depth into the plaque as necessary multiple cuts can be made with the same device until sufficient plaque has been removed to restore adequate blood flow in the arteryocelot ocelot pixl and ocelot mvrxocelot is a cto crossing catheter to integrate realtime oct imaging which allows physicians to see the inside of an artery during a cto crossing procedure ocelot allows physicians to navigate through ctos by utilizing the oct images to guide the device through the arterial blockage while minimizing disruption to the arterial structures ocelot has a corkscrewlike tip that rotates to facilitate advancement of the catheter through a cto marker bands are displayed on the oct image and allow the tip of the catheter to be steered towards the blockage and away from the arterial wall as it moves through the blockage once through the blockage a guidewire can be extended and ocelot is removed leaving the wire in place for additional therapies such as the use of an atherectomy catheter like pantheris the company also offers ocelot pixl a lower profile ctocrossing device for belowtheknee arteries and ocelot mvrx which offers a different tip design for abovetheknee arteriesother productsthe companys ctocrossing catheters wildcat and kittycat  employ a design that uses a rotational spinning technique allowing the physician to switch between
