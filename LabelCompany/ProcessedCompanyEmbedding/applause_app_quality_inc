current userwhat do you like besttesting a mobile or web application can be difficult with all the operating systems types and versions screen resolutions and other factors that vary between devices testing inhouse for a small company is challenging and applause comes to solve this problem they offer in the wild testing so your app is being tested on a variety of devices and locations if needed which makes the testing process as close as possible to real world usage applause provides a good coverage of oss and devices for testing so it saves you from having to buy many devices for testing your app some of the main benefits are  you control the tests and can connect with applause testers at any time  you are kept up to date regarding the status of the tests  it has a very intuitive user interface  if you need multilingual test they provide testers in many locations that can test in their native language  applause integrates with most of the popular bug tracking systems  the testerswhat do you dislikehaving testers who are not familiar with your app can add time to the testing process and may add test cycles testers skill leve can vary and so is their ability to dig deeper in the app to find more low level issues so it takes a more detailed testing plan and test cases prepared by the developer can take some time until you learn to use the service effectively and actually save on testing time the applause service is expensive but you do save on buying devices for testing recommendations to others considering the productplan your testing in details before

realworld results with testing on real devices that arent as pristine as normal qa lab devices a huge advantage is that you getting feedback from people who would normally be your customers on their devices including some whacky stuff that would only happen under real world conditions better to know now than after releasewhat do you dislikethe only drawback is sometimes depending on what testers accept your test cycle feedback can be inconsistent on quality although you can run many test cycles and have different users for each one recommendations to others considering the productif you are skeptical and can work it out at least do a trial application or two  you will see the benefitwhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedbeing a relatively small developer but with a huge customer base applause allowed us to increase the quality of our app by expanding the number of users and the numbers of devices that were used for qa purposes we had a ton of users but with only a few dedicated qa people we needed to branch out and make sure what we were seeing in the lab or not seeing in the lab was what the customers were seeing worldwide read

product with a range of different types of testing available from functional through to specialist security testing while we are only just starting our journey with the product it has proved its worth finding some vital bugs which would have impacted our apps on launch it is great for quick review cycles at short notice to supplement our qa teams with additional breadth and coverage you can go home of a evening and come back the next day to a qa cycle having been run we havent yet used the other products from applause including their tracking software although we plan to use this in the coming monthswhat do you dislikegetting consistency and a repeat user base that is our next step to build a regular team almost like having our own qa department there is nothing really to dislike as it is what you make of the servicerecommendations to others considering the producttrial the service do a test and learn and then develop the strategy and how you will use the product you need some specific goals you are trying to address such as device coverage what business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedwe are trying to solve having limited time for qa but with the coming together of our products in to a omnichannel experience we have to test more but within the same timescales using applause gives us flexibility to test a greater range of devices cover more systems and provide in the wild experiences of our apps and website just doing the things that customers do but before we go live the exploratory nature and motivation of the testers plus the support of the applause qa leads is now becoming a cornerstone of our testing strategy read moreshare on of  found this helpfulhelpfulyesno commentsadd a commentadd a commentrespond as applausereport

todays landscape presents a challenging problem there are so many platforms devices and os permutations that running these comprehensively inhouse is an exhaustive and expensive approach applause solves this testing problem with their inthewild service by having a large managed resource of global testers that can effectively simulate realworld testing its as close to the realworld happy path as you can getwhat do you dislikethough applause effectively manages their testers there can be a gap at times between lining up the testers and getting the results you want its a fine balance between fresh eyes gleaning new or glossed over bugs but running the risk of being product ignorant vs returning testers generating more indepth issues and risking test exhaustion and jaded perspectives direction is key to getting the testers to generate the results you want most importantly maintaining a close relationship with your applause project manager to ensure the testteam is managed appropriatelywhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedmobile apps today require fast and frequent updates running exhaustive test suites is time consuming and limited to the prescribed tests defined plus the platformsdevicesos onhand opening up and augmenting this classic regression test approach with applauses inthewild service significantly reduces

reviewreview sourceapplause is great for scaling qaupdated on october  validated reviewwhat do you like bestthe pm was very responsive and helpful when setting up the test cycles and made it very easy to get a test up and running with very little notice also since testers are from around the world and typically do this on a part time basis it was easy to get overnight and weekend cycles running the bug management tool was also easy to use and you could leave messages for testers if you had questions about the bugs they opened what do you dislikei feel there are some drawbacks to the payperbug compensation structure for testers although there were certainly critical bugs that were uncovered a lot of the bugs seemed extraneous and it was tedious sifting through them all i feel like i spent a lot of time going through bugs to determine which ones were out of scope or reproducible even though the test lead had done some of the work for me also when we had subsequent test cycles to retest a build with fixes in it tester engagement dropped off pretty quicklywhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedwe needed to be able to ramp up qa resources

engineers without the support of applause we would not be able to succeed in qa they solve our issues on a weekly basis by helping us test every tuesday that frees up the developers to develop instead of helping us test it also allows us to hone in on the larger issues found rather then to get caught up in the small details also when big changes are sprung upon us the exploratory testing cycles are

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
