facebook twitter google linked in email print pimco absolute return strategy pars profile main bodystrategy overviewmany investors are searching for sources of additional return without systematic exposure to stock and bond markets and they are looking to investment managers with proven expertise substantial risk management resources and a timetested investment process motivations to search for attractive absolute  excess returns include the desire to transport returns to other more efficient markets as well as desires for superior standalone absolute return investments pimco offers the “pars” investment approach which we believe will appeal to investors searching for consistent reliable sources of return  excess return pimco absolute return strategy pars is a unique and innovative investment approach that captures pimco’s investment process in a substantially unconstrained framework pars expands the traditional investment toolkit by using short derivatives and prudent amounts of leverage to express pimco’s investment ideas and isolate desired exposures from unwanted risks in an effort to exploit anomalies and capture value in global fixed income markets investors can select from four different pars strategy variations that best meet their risk and return preferencespars investment approach we believe that using multiple sources of value added in pars is an outstanding way to seek to produce consistent excess returns pimco implements a large number of diversified strategies and does not rely on only one type of strategy or one sector of the market to help add value pimco utilizes its expertise in a wide range of areas in an attempt to add value pimco absolute return strategies seek to produce absolute returns by expressing pimco’s investment ideas in portfolios that are not tied to traditional investment benchmarks these strategies subject to a suitable set of investment guidelines permit shorting of individual securities and the prudent use of leverage and derivatives portfolio positions are driven both by the firm’s topdown macroeconomic investment research process and by bottomup relative value thinking by portfolio managers who specialize in particular sectors of the global fixed income markets portfolio managers diversify investment portfolios across a broad array of risk factors and they employ a significant number of security specific strategies pars portfolios express the firm’s topdown investment process by magnifying the principal risk factor exposures of pimco total return and global bond portfolios positioning the pars portfolios in this way allows the strategy portfolios to express pimco’s investment ideas but without undesired benchmark risks benchmark risks in the context of a broad bond market index include continuous long exposure to interest rates credit mortgages and other issues that may or may not be attractive at any moment in time pimco’s cyclical and secular economic forums drive the topdown element of the firm’s investment process which begins with an annual secular forum in which investment professionals from all of our global offices convene for three days during this time leading industry experts are invited to give presentations on various global economic and financial topics these presentations are followed by discussions among pimco’s investment professionals regarding the outlook for the global economy and interest rates over the next three to five years at the completion of the discussions the investment professionals collectively determine a bullish neutral or bearish outlook in addition to the secular three to five year horizon pimco’s investment professionals hold quarterly economic forums to discuss near term trends and to establish a cyclical outlook these outlooks are considered by the portfolio management group in a separate quarterly meeting to translate global economic themes and specific views on market conditions and relative value into interest rate sector quality and volatility strategies sources of return magnifying the risk factor exposures as expressed in the firm’s total return and global portfolios generate approximately 6 to  of a pars portfolio’s potential excess returns over a floating rate base of reference such as libor our investment process can be thought of as an alpha transport exercise in which the firm’s core fixed income portfolio’s alpha with respect to the barclays capital us aggregate market index is transported to libor space the remainder of absolute return strategy portfolios’ excess returns should derive from their ability to take advantage of comparatively unrestrictive guidelines and to express those risk factors using the ideal securities or instruments other sources of the remaining excess returns will sometimes include quasirelative value strategies that rely on overlaystyle related positions to mitigate certain macro risks these positions are often generated by interaction of the absolute return strategy portfolio managers and the individual specialist portfolio managers topdown sources of value because pars portfolios are designed to leverage the firm’s ability to generate alpha in core fixed income portfolios investors benefit from pimco’s over 5 years of experience the pars investment process is specifically tailored to incorporate these sources of incremental return broadly speaking three types of “topdown” approaches include  over and underweighting macro factors which include yield level yield curve slope country spread and currency  tactical allocations to and away from credit treasury inflationprotected securities tips municipal bonds interest rate swap spreads and mortgages  structural positions which include sales of interest rate volatility either through the purchase of mortgage securities or from the outright sale of options underweight positions in us treasury securities and overweights to treasury bond futures long positions at the short end of the yield curve which may benefit from attractive yield roll down and volatility characteristics bottomup sources of value over and above the alpha that the pars portfolios seek to generate from magnifying the firm’s topdown ideas portfolio managers attempt to generate significant excess returns from bottomup relative value strategies bottom up strategies draw on the expertise of pimco’s specialist teams to take advantage of structural inefficiencies market mispricings crosscounty or crosssector spread movements these additional returns should arise from using flexible portfolio guidelines to use the ideal set of instruments and positions for expressing risk factors from overlaying certain risk mitigating trades and from relative value trades that are developed during interaction with the various specialty areas of the firm pimco’s absolute return experience pars capitalizes on pimco’s experience managing us bond portfolios using our total return approach and expertise in fixed income markets around the globe our commitment to excellence in the management of fixed income portfolios is exemplified in our efforts to devote resources to every fixed income sector in markets across the globe while most daytoday portfolio management activities occur in our newport beach california office specialists in our nonus offices london munich singapore tokyo and sydney provide valuable insights on developments in the macroeconomic environment within their region and provide important trade recommendations as experts in their local markets benefits of pars no single strategy dominates risk the absolute return strategy integrates the full opportunity set of pimco’s investment ideas across the globe using multiple sources of valueadded the strategy capitalizes on a diversified set of exposures and investment strategies hinged on our expertise across local markets and depth of sector knowledge this active multimarket strategy executed by prudent investment management may help reduce the overall volatility of returns in the strategy   low correlation to traditional asset classes by owning a highly diversified set of assets the absolute return strategy demonstrates low correlation to traditional asset classes such as bonds and stocks the strategy can provide significant diversification benefit for the investor   lack of benchmark constraints may help optimize returnrisk the absolute return strategy is detached from a traditional benchmark index allowing the strategy flexibility in identifying and implementing the most optimum investment strategies with this separation of index weights and other constraints the absolute return strategy is not subject to factor exposures that might underperform on an absolute basis and instead can take advantage of differences in regional economic cycles growth trajectories and relative valuations with sectors   various returnrisk versions available several versions of the absolute return strategy are available with similar overall exposures but different only in riskreturn targets this allows the investors to best match their riskreturn preferences with the version closest to their profile all versions take advantage of the same portfolio management expertise global resources implementation and execution and risk control systems in place at pimco risk management  controls control risk to limit volatility a broad diversification of investment strategies helps limit the reliance on a single strategy to add alpha instead the exposures of the absolute return strategy are consistent with total return and global portfolios scaled only by leverage but without any imperative to track a broad market index the high average credit quality maintained and limited duration and currency exposure all help to control risk in the absolute return strategy in addition the strategy is managed to a target tracking error to help reduce volatility   transparency and proactive reporting we have clearly defined checks and balances to provide reasonable assurance that all risk exposures are handled in an appropriate manner advanced proprietary analytics allow us to model securities under a multitude of scenarios and we have dedicated a substantial amount of resources to monitoring both financial and operational risk   commitment to advanced risk management technology by virtue of our size pimco is able to commit significant human and financial resources to the development of advanced risk management systems we use advanced proprietary quantitative tools to both measure and monitor risks such as leverage the use of leverage in particular requires careful risk assessment and sophisticated management tools these models include our tracking error model the integrated position blotter system the global relative value report and a variety of customized risk reports also are employed to determine which strategies are adding value and which need to be modified extensive use of analytical models allows us to employ investment professionals more effectively and provides a dispassionate check on investment decisions   diversified stable investor base
