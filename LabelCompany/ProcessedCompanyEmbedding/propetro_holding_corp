the markets in which we operate are highly competitive to be successful an oilfield services company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies at competitive prices competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price reputation and technical expertise service and equipment quality and health and safety standards although we believe our customers consider all of these factors we believe price is a key factor in ep companies criteria in choosing a service provider while we seek to price our services competitively we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on our deep local roots operational expertise equipments ability to handle the most complex permian basin well completions and commitment to safety and reliability we provide our services primarily in the permian basin and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies including the largest integrated oilfield services companies our major competitors for hydraulic fracturing services which make up the majority of revenues include cj energy services halliburton pattersonuti energy inc rpc inc schlumberger superior energy services and a number of locally oriented businesses company description we are a growthoriented midland texasbased oilfield services company providing hydraulic fracturing and other complementary services to leading upstream oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration and production or ep of north american unconventional oil and natural gas resources our operations are primarily focused in the permian basin where we have cultivated longstanding customer relationships with some of the regions most active and wellcapitalized ep companies including callon petroleum diamondback energy parsley energy pioneer natural resources surge energy and xto energy for the year ended december   no single customer represented greater than  of our revenue the permian basin is widely regarded as the most prolific oilproducing area in the united states and we believe we are currently the largest private provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the region by hydraulic horsepower or hhp with an aggregate deployed capacity of  hhp our fleet which consists of  hydraulic fracturing units has been designed to handle the highest intensity most complex hydraulic fracturing jobs and has been  utilized since september  we have purchased two additional hydraulic fracturing units which are scheduled for delivery and deployment to dedicated customers in april and june  respectively these units will provide us with an additional  hhp bringing our total capacity to  hhp additionally we expect to use the proceeds from this offering to purchase two additional units that will be deployed in  to meet specific customer requests giving us an additional  hhp or  hhp in the aggregate once all units have been received our modern hydraulic fracturing fleet has been designed to handle permian basin specific operating conditions and the regions increasingly highintensity well completions which are characterized by longer horizontal wellbores more frac stages per lateral and increasing amounts of proppant per well over  of our fleet has been delivered over the past four years and we have fully maintained our equipment throughout the recent industry downturn to ensure optimal performance and reliability in contrast we believe many of our competitors have deferred necessary maintenance capital spending throughout the downturn which we believe positions us to respond more quickly and reliably to customer needs during the ongoing market recovery in addition to our core hydraulic fracturing operations we also offer a suite of complementary well completion and production services including cementing acidizing coiled tubing flowback services permian drilling and surface air drilling we believe these complementary services create operational efficiencies for our customers and allow us to capture a greater portion of their capital spending across the lifecycle of an unconventional well we believe that these complementary services should benefit from a continued industry recovery and that we are well positioned to continue expanding these offerings in response to our customers increasing service needs and spending levels our primary business objective is to serve as a strategic partner to our customers we achieve this objective by providing reliable highquality services that are tailored to our customers needs and synchronized with their well development programs this alignment assists our customers in optimizing the longterm development of their unconventional resources over the past four years we have leveraged our strong permian basin relationships to grow our installed hhp capacity by over four times and organically build our permian basin cementing coiled tubing and acidizing lines of business consistent with past performance we believe our substantial market presence will continue to yield a variety of actionable growth opportunities allowing us to expand both our hydraulic fracturing and complementary services going forward to this end we intend to continue our past practice of opportunistically deploying new equipment on a longterm dedicated basis in response to specific customer demand  our principal executive offices are located at  s midkiff bldg b midland texas  and our telephone number is   following
