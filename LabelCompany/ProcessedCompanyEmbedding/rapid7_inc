stable release   february    repository httpsgithubcomrapidmetasploitframework httpsgithubcomrapidmetasploitframeworkgit development status active operating system crossplatform type security license framework bsd communityexpresspro proprietary website wwwmetasploitcom the metasploit project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and ids signature development its bestknown subproject is the open source metasploit framework a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine other important subprojects include the opcode database shellcode archive and related research the metasploit project is well known for its antiforensic and evasion tools some of which are built into the metasploit framework contents  history  metasploit framework  metasploit interfaces  metasploit framework edition  metasploit community edition  metasploit express  metasploit pro  armitage  cobalt strike  exploits  payloads  contributors  see also  references  further reading  external links historyedit metasploit was created by h d moore in  as a portable network tool using perl by  the metasploit framework had been completely rewritten in ruby on october   the metasploit project announced that it had been acquired by rapid a security company that provides unified vulnerability management solutions like comparable commercial products such as immunitys canvas or core security technologies core impact metasploit can be used to test the vulnerability of computer systems or to break into remote systems like many information security tools metasploit can be used for both legitimate and unauthorized activities since the acquisition of the metasploit framework rapid has added two open core proprietary editions called metasploit express and metasploit pro metasploits emerging position as the de facto exploit development framework led to the release of software vulnerability advisories often accompanied by a third party metasploit exploit module that highlights the exploitability risk and remediation of that particular bug metasploit  began to include fuzzing tools used to discover software vulnerabilities rather than just exploits for known bugs this avenue can be seen with the integration of the lorcon wireless  toolset into metasploit  in november  metasploit  was released in august  metasploit frameworkedit the basic steps for exploiting a system using the framework include choosing and configuring an exploit code that enters a target system by taking advantage of one of its bugs about  different exploits for windows unixlinux and mac os x systems are included optionally checking whether the intended target system is susceptible to the chosen exploit choosing and configuring a payload code that will be executed on the target system upon successful entry for instance a remote shell or a vnc server choosing the encoding technique so that the intrusionprevention system ips ignores the encoded payload executing the exploit this modular approach – allowing the combination of any exploit with any payload – is the major advantage of the framework it facilitates the tasks of attackers exploit writers and payload writers metasploit runs on unix including linux and mac os x and on windows the metasploit framework can be extended to use addons in multiple languages to choose an exploit and payload some information about the target system is needed such as operating system version and installed network services this information can be gleaned with port scanning and os fingerprinting tools such as nmap vulnerability scanners such as nexpose nessus and openvas can detect target system vulnerabilities metasploit can import vulnerability scanner data and compare the identified vulnerabilities to existing exploit modules for accurate exploitation metasploit interfacesedit there are several interfaces for metasploit available the most popular are maintained by rapid and strategic cyber llc metasploit framework editionedit the free version it contains a command line interface thirdparty import manual exploitation and manual brute forcing this free version of metasploit project also includes zenmap  a well known portsscanner and a compiler for ruby  the language in which this version of metasploit was written  metasploit community editionedit in october  rapid released metasploit community edition a free webbased user interface for metasploit metasploit community is based on the commercial functionality of the paidfor editions with a reduced set of features including network discovery module browsing and manual exploitation metasploit community is included in the main installer metasploit expressedit in april  rapid released metasploit express an opencore commercial edition for security teams who need to verify vulnerabilities it offers a graphical user interface integrates nmap for discovery and adds smart bruteforcing as well as automated evidence collection metasploit proedit in october  rapid added metasploit pro an opencore commercial metasploit edition for penetration testers metasploit pro adds onto metasploit express with features such as quick start wizardsmetamodules building and managing social engineering campaigns web application testing an advanced pro console dynamic payloads for antivirus evasion integration with nexpose for adhoc vulnerability scans and vpn pivoting armitageedit armitage is a graphical cyber attack management tool for the metasploit project that visualizes targets and recommends exploits it is a free and open source network security tool notable for its contributions to red team collaboration allowing for shared sessions data and communication through a single metasploit instance cobalt strikeedit cobalt strike is a collection of threat emulation tools provided by strategic cyber llc to work with the metasploit framework cobalt strike includes all features of armitage and adds postexploitation tools in addition to report generation features exploitsedit metasploit currently has over  exploits organized in different categories like firefox is a collection of mostly remote code execution for this browser android and apples ios are dedicated to mobile phone linux windows bsd irix solaris … are targeting specific

or run arbitrary commands against the host meterpreter enables users to control the screen of a device using vnc and to browse upload and download files dynamic payloads enables users to evade antivirus defenses by generating unique payloads contributorsedit metasploit framework operates as an opensource project and accepts contributions from the community through githubcom pull requests

of issues surfaced that leak personally identifying geolocation data to unauthorized third parties attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to locate individual users devices and in some cases alter geolocation data for those devices the table below briefly summarizes the twelve vulnerabilities identified across three products vulnerabilitydevicer idcvecleartext passwordtrackr

description bluetooth low energy ble device trackers are small hardware tokens that are designed to be attached to personal items such as keyrings wallets or purses these devices pair with the users smartphone via bluetooth and can alert the user when the device moves out of range the tracking hardware tokens themselves do not maintain network connections but rely on associated smartphone apps to report geolocation data the devices examined were the trackr bravo from trackr the itrack easy from kkmcmcom and the nut from zizai tech the tile from tile inc was also examined but none of these issues were discovered with this product aside from a minor screenshot caching issue which does not appear to reveal private information vulnerability details for each product vulnerability details and possible mitigations are discussed below users concerned about these issues should reach out to their respective vendors using their normal support mechanisms and update their mobile applications when fixes are released until vendorsupplied fixes are available the risks associated with these vulnerabilities should be weighed against the benefits of continuing to use these tracker devices and applications most of the vulnerabilities described are only exploitable by an adversary who is in close physical proximity to the affected devices the effective range of an exploit is noted on the summary table for each vendorr multiple vulnerabilities in trackr bravo vulnerabilityr idcverangecleartext passwordrcvelocal devicetracking id exposedrcvebluetoothunauthenticated

information such as passwords in cleartext while some local storage is likely necessary for normal functionality such information should be stored in an encrypted format that requires device authentication users are strongly advised to avoid reusing passwords between services whenever possible in order to limit the damaging effects of accidental or intentional exposure of account credentials r device tracking id exposed cvethe trackr device id can be obtained by being in close proximity to a trackr device and utilizing a bluetooth low energy ble application to monitor for ble devices the trackr id is the manufacturer device id which is constructed of a manufacture identifier of four zeroes  followed by the ble mac address in reverse fcxxxxxxd for a combined trackr id of fcxxxxxxd this is shown in figure  mitigation for ra vendorsupplied patch should change the tracker id so that is not directly related to the manufacturer device id nor the devices ble mac address absent a vendorsupplied patch users should be mindful of when they use the trackr device in public spaces as this id can be reused on the cloudhosted service to track devices and therefore the user remotely as described in r r unauthenticated access cveunauthenticated access to the cloudbased service maintained by the vendor is allowed for querying or sending gps data authentication appears to only be used to sync data back to the mobile application during application install or reinstall an adversary can access gps data for any trackr device from any web browser without authentication by using the tracker id number figure  which can be discovered while being in bluetooth range as described above as r the url format is httpsphonehalocloudappspotcomresttrackerfcxxxxxxd mitigation for ra vendorsupplied patch to the cloud service should enable authentication before gps data can be queried or written to the via the cloud service api absent a vendorsupplied patch users should be mindful of when they use the trackr device in public which will expose the device id as described in r r unauthenticated pairing cvetrackr bravo device allows unauthenticated bluetooth pairing which allows unauthenticated connected applications to write data to various device attributes in the below example this vulnerability allowed the devices advertised name to be changed via ble  generic access x device name xa as shown in figure this lack of write access authorization also allows an adversary to enable the devices remote alarm triggering the alarm to both cause annoyance and drain the devices battery figure  describes this access via ble  generic access x device name xa  mitigation for rwhile the device is designed to pair with any nearby application to perform crowdsourced opportunistic geolocation services a vendorsupplied patch should enable proper authenticated pairing for write access so only the authorized users mobile application can pair and alter data on the

comes into detection range of another users itrack mobile application the mobile application then sets the getgps gps data for that detected devices losserid with the cmdsetothergps this vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary to register the authorized users device and therefore gain access to gps data any time the device comes in proximity of a running instance of the itrack mobile application mitigations for ra vendorsupplied patch should prevent the duplicate registration of devices absent a vendorsupplied patch users should be mindful of using the itrack device in public spaces as described in r r unauthenticated modification cvethe getgps data can be written without authentication by setting the data using the parametercmdsetothergps an example of this is shown in figure  this vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary to alter the gps location data of a lost device mitigations for ra vendorsupplied patch should require authentication before allowing write access for the data stored for getgps r weak session management cvesession cookies are not used for maintaining valid sessions the users password is passed as a post parameter over https using a base encoded passwd field on every request an example of this is shown in figure  collected using standard maninthemiddle mitm techniquesit is a best practice to manage web service sessions with session cookies rather than resending the users password session cookies can be expired or invalidated upstream after a timeout period or in the event of a compromise in this implementation sessions can only be terminated when the user changes the associated password mitigations for ra vendorsupplied patch should enable proper session management absent a vendorsupplied patch users should be mindful of when they use the itrack device in public spaces and avoid connecting their mobile device to an unknown or open public wifi access point r cleartext baseencoded password cveexamination of the itrack

technique is shown in figure  mitigation for ra vendorsupplied patch should configure the mobile app to always communicate over https rather than the cleartext http protocol in addition the mobile application should pass session tokens only via http headers or as part of a post request rather than embedding the token in the url absent a vendorsupplied patch users should be mindful of when they

attention to the challenges customers face always looking for simple innovative solutions what they consistently heard from customers was that security was a huge and complex challenge for their organizations tas chad and alan realized that good security starts with visibility  visibility into what’s on your network your assets the vulnerabilities and the prevalent threats they saw that the industry lacked solutions for comprehensive security assessments that enabled smart decisions and the ability to act effectively no single solution could identify vulnerabilities across the entire it environment of network hardware software web and database components while vulnerabilities abounded across all these areas they decided to do something about it and rapid was born so how did we get our name when the company first launched it was based in midtown new york alan tas and chad traveled daily into the city on new york’s rapid transit system’s rapid train you might notice our logo looks a bit like a bullettrain with much of the planning and development for the company discussed on that commute it seemed only right to name the company rapid it was perfect today the name embodies our companys commitment to rapidly responding to our customers’ needs their evolving it environments and the emerging threats they face so we can help them keep moving forward our mission is to solve

company description rapid is a leading provider of security data and analytics solutions that enable organizations to implement an active analyticsdriven approach to cyber security our security data and analytics platform was purpose built for today’s increasingly complex and chaotic it environment we combine our extensive experience in security data and analytics and deep insight into attacker behaviors and techniques to make sense of the wealth of data available to organizations about their it environments and users there has been an explosion of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks as the proliferation of mobile devices cloudbased applications and solutions relying on user credentials has eliminated the boundaries that previously defined an organization’s network perimeter and expanded the threat surface that organizations must now defend our powerful and proprietary analytics enable organizations to contextualize and prioritize the threats facing their physical virtual and cloud assets including those posed by the behaviors of their users leveraging our security data and analytics platform our solutions enable organizations to strategically and dynamically manage their cyber security exposure our solutions empower organizations to prevent attacks by providing visibility into vulnerabilities and to rapidly detect compromises respond to breaches and correct the underlying causes of attacks this balanced and analyticsfocused approach ultimately better secures organizations’ environments and reduces the likelihood of and risks associated with cyber attacks we believe our technology and solutions revolutionize the practice of cyber security and are central and critical to implementing a modern security program with our security data and analytics platform at our core we are pioneering active analyticsdriven solutions to cyber security that enable organizations to find and eliminate critical weaknesses and detect attacks in their it environments our threat exposure management offerings include our industryleading vulnerability management products which we enhance with deep security analytics capabilities to quickly deliver contextual risk prioritization critical threat awareness and impactful remediation guidance similarly we added analytics and automation to traditional manual penetration testing to be able to deliver robust ongoing attack simulation solutions that provide organizations with visibility into realworld threats by providing and combining analytics and actionable insights related to both an organization’s attack surface and the dynamic threat landscape our security data and analytics platform enables organizations to manage their threat exposure above and beyond traditional vulnerability management products on the market further leveraging our technology platform and analytics capabilities we recently introduced our incident detection product to provide organizations with the ability to rapidly detect and respond to cyber security incidents and breaches to complement our incident detection product we also recently introduced our incident response services which provide our customers with critical access to our security experts and experience enabling them to accelerate incident response and containment we also offer security advisory services that help organizations develop a holistic approach to their cyber security programs and advance their cyber security program maturity all of our products have been designed with an intuitive user interface focused on easeofuse and fast timetovalue for our customers cyber security has become a strategic imperative for organizations globally driven by increased focus by boards of directors and senior management in the wake of numerous recent high profile breaches and data thefts organizations are increasingly at risk of being compromised with the number of reported security incidents within enterprises increasing  in  over the prior year according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers llp there are three converging macro drivers that are changing the cyber security landscape for organizations and driving the increase in cyber breaches first mobile and connected devices cloudbased applications and more open and interconnected networks have increased it complexity expanding the exploitable attack surface across an organization and resulting in more sources of potential vulnerability second there has been a dramatic change in the tools available to cyber attackers attackers can now purchase highly effective and easytouse software at very low cost that is designed to circumvent traditional preventionbased tools thereby lowering the bar for nearly anyone to launch advanced cyber attacks third the economic motives for attackers are more compelling with new vibrant markets providing attackers an efficient and effective way to monetize stolen customer information and employee data the confluence of these factors has rendered the old model of “block and protect” preventionbased cyber security programs ineffective these traditional “block and protect” approaches to cyber security typically rely disproportionately on network perimeter protection tools such as firewalls and antivirus software to stop attackers however as the network perimeter rapidly disappears the effectiveness of these legacy solutions diminishes greatly further preventative solutions are generally not able to identify or deter attacks that involve stolen or weak credentials which are used in  of cyber attacks according to the  verizon data breach investigations report when an attacker gains access to an organization’s network through compromised credentials or otherwise the attacker can freely exploit assets within the breached environment until they are detected which took a median of  days in  according to a report by mandiant the decreasing effectiveness of a traditional preventionfocused approach to cyber security is causing a significant shift to a new model that uses an active analyticsdriven approach to reduce and manage risks to the organization this new model disrupts the historical focus on “block and protect” solutions and balances organizations’ investments in prevention detection and correction to reduce the likelihood of and risks associated with cyber attacks effective implementation of this new model demands data and analytics to assess the effectiveness of tools and programs identify attacker behaviors and prioritize and remediate exposures rapid empowers organizations to better secure their dynamic it environments by providing the security data and analytics that are at the core of a holistic and active analyticsdriven approach to cyber security  we
