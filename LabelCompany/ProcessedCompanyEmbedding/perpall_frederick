contractors bonus the beck groups fred perpall  d magazine view issue subscribe view issue subscribe view issue subscribe let’s make dallas even better bonus the beck group’s fred perpall by christine perez published in commercial real estate may    am sms fred perpall ceo of the beck group for a story in the mayjune issue of d ceo magazine i interviewed fred perpall the yearold ceo of the beck group he’s a fascinating guy and we had a terrific conversation transcribed the interview came in at  words far fewer made it into the print edition readers didn’t hear for example about how perpall likes to have oneonone “meetings” by heading outside of the company’s ross avenue office in downtown dallas and walking around the block “what’s genius about it is that it’s refreshing i have better conversations out in the fresh air we’re stretching our legs and once we go around the block we’re done” he says “it’s better than waxing philosophical in a conference room for two hours” here then as part of d real estate daily’s ongoing “bonus” series are additional perspectives from perpall who talks about his life growing up in the bahamas his management strategies and how in just  years he went from joining the beck group as a yearold to becoming its ceo athletics and architecture i lived in the bahamas until i was  when i moved to arlington to attend college most of my life until that point was built around athletics i played basketball and ran track i had the opportunity to do both at the university of texas at arlington but i ended up doing neither i quickly found out that architecture and basketball didn’t go hand in hand particularly because basketball is a twosemester sport and design studios are both semesters i transferred to uta as a junior as i got serious about architecture my athletic career came to an end i was probably about ′ ″ when i was  years old my father had a brother who was about ′ ″ uncle percy he was a mason my dad had me work for uncle percy in the summer that’s when my interest in buildings and the construction industry was piqued i loved that these guys were hands on using their hands to build in our case some retail and hospitality type products i got into architecture because i had always loved creativity and sketching and all that and i always wanted to be in the “building buildings” business but spending a hot summer in the tropics mixing cement you’d be out there all day lifting sand and mixing it with water and cement and a little bit of lime and the architect would pull up in his nice airconditioned car look around for  minutes then be on his way it has been great for me at beck because we do both design and construction it feeds both desires i particularly enjoy the diversity of people i get to work with to get the job done not just the creative types or the technical types but the combination that diversity for me is very exciting because i was interested in doing both early achiever i had my master’s degree by the time i was  i started college when i was  we have a system in the bahamas where after finishing grade six they test you if you test at an th grade competency they put you in th grade the only thing it doesn’t take into consideration is maturity it didn’t equalize with me until i was probably  or  when everyone is equally immature people tell me “you’re so young as a ceo” yes i’ young in age but in terms of tenure this is the th year of my career i have been blessed to have had a head start and to have wonderful parents who kept moving me along you don’t do this by yourself you have good people around you who help you make good decisions i remember when i called my father to tell him i was dropping out of architecture to play basketball that was a good one that lasted about five minutes that was the intention but by five minutes into the call i was dropping basketball to play architecture after i got my master’s degree i went to rome for six months living in europe made me really miss the caribbean the united states is very different from europe and the bahamas is kind of like a mixture of both i also thought that at all of  i’d go start my own business i thought being in a smaller place i’d have a better shot this was in  so i went back to the bahamas for a year and tried my hand at running my own firm smalltown values my parents were just amazing godfearing people smalltown values hardworking individuals my mom ran two cafeterias she was up every day at  or  am the job with uncle percy was respite from peeling potatoes my parents were really into keeping their kids busy if we were not at church we were at boy scouts if we weren’t at boy scouts we were working in our business—everything from scrubbing the floors in the kitchen to bussing tables to washing macaroni pans it was always about doing something for them it was all about work ethic my mom ran the business but it was really like a ministry if people came in and didn’t have money they would get fed anyway when she passed my sister took over the business and profitability went up  percent we realized then how much food my mother was giving away my mom taught me to always be interested in other people—not just be interesting toward people but being interested in them she was just a very special person they say the sins of parents fall on children but i think the blessings of parents fall on children too my four sisters and i are all living off the blessings of our parents my dad though if you’ve met me you’ve met him he was an engineer he’s retired now and living in the bahamas for him it’s all about discipline hard work accountability doing what you say you’re going to do and that’s one of the reasons i really love working at beck any number of mentors i’ve had in the firm here they’re the same way we’re a very humble company we try not to brag in fact i remember us having a long discussion about whether to put our name on this building we don’t want to be too showy fulfilling dreams after i went back to the bahamas to start my own business my first job was designing a home for a husband and wife i was more therapist than i was an architect and i realized that the business i wanted to be in was building even when i was an architect i wanted to be a builder at beck we are in the design and construction business so it’s like a fulfillment of a personal dream on a much different scale our values here at beck are to take care of people—take care of the people we work with us and take care of our clients we aren’t motivated by the profits of any project we’re motivated by keeping great relationships we’re motivated by what’s best for everyone long term we know we have to perform in the short term but we think if we keep a longterm perspective the shortterm performance will always take care of itself it’s also important to hire great people life is too short to work with people you don’t enjoy being around we’ve hired  employees last year and now have more than  firmwide we expect to create  to  new jobs this year and we’re in  different markets dallas houston fort worth austin san antonio atlanta tampa denver washington dc mexico city and los cabos for me in leading a company you have to be curious about people that lesson from my mother to always look people in the eyes and be interested in them is very important if you’re always thinking about how do we help our customers get to their dreams how do we help them get to their goals if you’re thinking about that on the one hand but you’re also thinking about how do i help my people who work with me every day to get to their dreams if you find away through your business to connect those two things then you’ll always have the success you want as a business collaboration and competition how many companies hire a yearold and turn him into a ceo that’s a statement about the company more than it is about me and beck has done it not once but four times i’m not a oneoff we’ve had five ceos in the company’s year history i’m the fifth all four of us other than the founder all got to ceo before we were  and all were hired into the firm as somethings of the five three of them have been becks but every last one of them has had a year run it’s easy to try to make the story about fred the way pop culture works is they want to make it about you but the way we have to keep it oriented is this is not about me it’s really about what the company believes and the investment we make in our people how that manifests itself is you end up creating leaders for yourself we’ve also created a lot of leaders for other companies too we’re looking at a big joint venture with another company and this company’s founder came from our company it makes it easy for us to come together because they believe in a lot of the same things we believe in great companies collaborate with their colleagues bestinclass companies spend time with their competitors the world is getting very gray it used to be that competition was black and white but some days we may compete but other days we may be collaborating on a building another architect designed today’s business leaders have to be more flexible about looking for ways to collaborate more we believe that space between collaboration and competition that “collaboration” is a big part of the future of all business and by the way it’s fun too when you get out there and see what other people are doing it jazzes you up when i played basketball you know who i wanted to play against in the summer not my teammates i wanted to go down the street and play with other teams bestinclass athletes do that too lebron james works out in the off season with kevin durand bestinclass businesses spend time with their competitors too i’m a big fan of that and i think it’s a big opportunity for us leftbrain rightbrain i began my career straight up as a design architect i like to make that distinction being a creative architect that’s probably the furthest path to ceo because it’s a creative position you’re blue sky always fighting the business in many ways because you never want a budget or a schedule when i left the bahamas i came back to north texas in  i joined a firm called urban architecture a year later it merged with beck we were a much younger company i was  at the time and the average middle manager at beck was older than our principals what happened to us particularly those of us who were younger in the firm who were curious about a lot of things we instantly had a pathway to explore more things we were curious about for me i was always curious about business how do you create value how do you retain customers how do you have the empathy it takes to put yourselves in a customer’s shoes there were also different ideas about what success looks like sometimes when you’re in a company that only deals with one part of an industry you may only be optimizing that particular piece of what that overall industry does we have a big belief here borne out out of lean practice principles that you can’t optimize an industry by optimizing just one piece of it to optimize the whole you have to optimize each piece of it moving to beck at a younger age it gave those of us who were “children of the merger” the opportunity early on in our career to explore new things working with people in different disciplines also made us have to rise to a new standard of proficiency about  years ago i began taking more business classes i started to think about finance and the impact the cost of money has on what we do about customer service and customer relationships sometimes as architects the customer can be the main inhibitor of us getting what we want it’s different when you have a year old company and  percent of your business comes from the same people over and over again if you want to do great design and keep your customer happy—they’re not mutually exclusive things but it does require a lot more work if you want to have great design and build your building on time and on budget it requires more collaboration that whole notion of “collaboratition” also is internal because we have competing ideas different mindsets and that tension has to play out it takes great relationships to undergird that tension when we marry many of us marry people who have different skill sets than we do it’s the whole opposites attract if that’s good in marriage and in your personal life it’s good in business too you just have to have that strong partnership so when that tension plays out it doesn’t kill the relationship a different kind of diversity in america we like to think about diversity only from a gender or ethnic standpoint but diversity is much broader than that and much deeper than that for us here at beck it’s about brain styles it’s about experience it’s about age this is the first time in american history that we have four different generations together in the workplace at beck the ceo before the ceo before me is still here so how do we leverage the benefit having all of these different generations working together for us it’s a big opportunity bestinclass companies understand not only their customers but they seek to understand their customer’s customer so if we’re building hospitals and universities and high schools each of these businesses are trying to reach different customers in their own right so us having that diversity here under one roof play out in a very rich way helping us understand our customer’s customer in a way that might prove to be more valuable for them we celebrate the tension that comes from diversity teams that are homogenous—in other words teams of all architects or all builders or all women or men all black guys all white guys whatever—teams that are homogenous get along quicker earlier but their performance is always going to cap at a certain point teams that are diverse they may take longer to get along but when they start to perform they’re going to outperform the teams that are all homogenous in a way that is unbelievable they have more points of reference they have more capacity the range is broader the perspective is broader the capacity to perform is broader we want to have that kind of diversity of expertise of background of experience of generation gender—we want to have all that at play in our firm we believe that when you’re in the services business the value you create is only as big as the capacity you have and the capacity you have is only as big as the ideas and people and experiences you have under one roof we love that i always give people the blank stare when they ask about diversity because they’re thinking “oh you’re a black guy let’s talk about diversity” but that’s not the way we see diversity when you combine different perspectives it may take longer to get along—maybe at first i can’t tell all my jokes but over time when you can do that it’s unbelievable” the pathway to ceo after urban architecture merged with beck in  i began moving up through architecture ranks about midway through all of this in  i was sent to atlanta to establish our design practice it was an existing office that had construction but not architecture i focused pretty much on the value we could create for our customers which again caused me to go way out of my comfort zone and look at the construction business which was different at the time we didn’t have a lot of architects running construction jobs it also put a lot of pressure on my education i had three degrees at that point but they were all in architecture at some point when you’re the business executive being a designer doesn’t cut it what about accounting finance risk management marketing and pr … it put pressure on me to go get competencies in those areas i did that through a number of ways i joined vistage which has been a big part of my career growth it allowed me to connect with other business leaders and learn how to run a business not just build buildings i also went to harvard and completed the advanced management program which is an unbelievable program for senior executives so again how does a company take a yearold and create a ceo it’s only through the persistence of our former ceo and the people in our talent development team as well as the many mentors and managers too many to name that has allowed me to go through this track by  i was running the business in atlanta and at the beginning of january i became ceo culture and strategy people think the ceo is in charge but in reality everyone else is in charge you just have to be a great steward those folks have put me in this role and i feel a tremendous responsibility it has been unbelievably fun too life is too short not to have fun if we have to show up here every day we better be enjoying this that’s the other part for me it has been flatout enjoyable if your energy isn’t good the energy of the company won’t be good it’s like culture when people say you have a good culture what they’re really saying is that you have good people i want the best and brightest to feel like their dreams can come true here and that they’re going to enjoy it along the way i don’t know if anything is more important you could have the best strategy in the world but it won’t mean anything if you have the wrong people the right culture trumps strategy every time outlook at beck what i’m most excited about getting back into is getting reengaged into the dallas community—that’s probably the biggest opportunity for me over the next few years and it’s great to be with a company that has that track record and priority in place like many things it’s hard to measure the direct benefit of that but we know that over time that giving does come back many fold and that’s something i have a passion for you don’t take your leadership hat off when you get into the elevator to go home for the night it’s great to be back in texas great to be back in dallas the opportunities here are just amazing and in terms of a place to raise your family and employ your craft we’ve had doubledigit growth in revenue all that is indicative of the markets in which we work tampa has rebounded nicely texas is going gangbusters austin is growing very fast we’re looking to grow our office in houston—there’s so much activity there—and north texas is doing very well i’m also fortunate that peter former ceo peter beck who now serves as executive chairman who has been an amazing leader for us for  years in many ways he was very gracious to ride out the downturn and get me put in place with a little bit of wind at my back that’s how you develop credibility with your people and within the community so that was very gracious he has been a wonderful mentor—but he’s not going anywhere the handoff i use sports analogies all the time in track and field there are two races i love the × which is a hard race you have to sprint the whole thing it’s a long long sprint  meters by the time you get to the end of that  meters you’re going to collapse you hand that baton off right as you collapse the × is a different race the americans are great at this you get off boom its a sprint it’s a fast race and just as you get to top speed your partner takes off now he’s at top speed you’re at top speed you have multiple times to hand that baton before you get out of that zone it’s like  percent of your entire leg so you both are running top speed and you hand that baton off to him then his partner gets up and running and they both get to top speed then they hand off at top speed nobody collapses you’re able to get the baton off much faster than doing it individually at beck we believe good leadership succession is like running the × you hand the baton off while you’re both at top speed i told peter you have to be  percent in the passing zone—he has to stay here for at least another  years so we have a nice long handoff most popular the dallas library is selling off a bunch of books by alex macon thousands of people are watching these crayons not melt by alex macon hot property

in d ceo mayjune  sms why you need to know him because he’s at the helm of the beck group one of the nation’s largest designbuild companies perpall  was named ceo in january after  years with beck “how many companies hire a yearold and turn him into a ceo” he asks “that’s a statement about the company more than it is about me” still early success is nothing new to perpall who began college in his home country of the bahamas when he was just  two years later he moved to texas to play basketball and run track for the university of texas at arlington by the time he was  he had a master’s degree in architecture at beck his natural curiosity was unleashed and he was given an opportunity to work on both the creative design side and the more technical “building buildings” side he opened up an architecture group for beck in atlanta then oversaw that market’s operations before moving back to texas to replace peter beck founder henry c beck sr’s grandson who’s now serving as executive chairman about  percent of beck’s business comes from designbuild projects the rest is thirdparty general contracting  and other work “the world is becoming very gray” perpall says “it used to be that competition was black and white but some days we may compete and other days we may be collaborating on a building another architect designed” he calls that space between collaboration and competition “collaboratition” the yearold beck has been experiencing rapid growth last year it added  employees bringing the total to more than  it expects to create  to  new jobs this year throughout it all perpall says he aims to maintain beck’s corporate culture “when people say you have a good culture what they’re really saying is that you have good people” he says “i want the best and brightest to
