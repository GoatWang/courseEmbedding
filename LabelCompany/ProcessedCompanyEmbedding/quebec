province of canada after ontario it is the only one to have a predominantly frenchspeaking population with french as the sole provincial official language quebec is canadas largest province by area and its secondlargest administrative division only the territory of nunavut is larger it is bordered to the west by the province of ontario james bay and hudson bay to the north by hudson strait and ungava bay to the east by the gulf of saint lawrence and the province of newfoundland and labrador and to the south by the province of new brunswick and the us states of maine new hampshire vermont and new york it also shares maritime borders with nunavut prince edward island and nova scotia most inhabitants live in urban areas near the saint lawrence river between montreal and quebec city the capital approximately half of quebec residents live in the greater montreal area including the island of montreal englishspeaking communities and englishlanguage institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of montreal but are also significantly present in the outaouais eastern townships and gaspé regions the nordduquébec region occupying the northern half of the province is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by aboriginal peoples the climate around the major cities is fourseason continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions even in central quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are severe in inland areas quebec independence debates have played a large role in the politics of the province parti québécois governments held referendums on sovereignty in  and  both were voted down by voters the latter defeated by a very narrow margin in  the house of commons of canada passed a symbolic motion recognizing the québécois as a nation within a united canada while the provinces substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace information and communication technologies biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading roles these many industries have all contributed to helping quebec become an economically influential province within canada second only to ontario in economic output contents

boundary changes the arrival of samuel de champlain the father of new france on the site of quebec city the name québec which comes from the algonquin word kébec meaning where the river narrows originally referred to the area around quebec city where the saint lawrence river narrows to a clifflined gap early variations in the spelling of the name included québecq levasseur  and kébec lescarbot  french explorer samuel de champlain chose the name québec in  for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the french colony of new france the province is sometimes referred to as la belle province the beautiful province the province of quebec was founded in the royal proclamation of  after the treaty of paris formally transferred the french colony of canada to britain after the seven years war the proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the saint lawrence river the quebec act of  expanded the territory of the province to include the great lakes and the ohio river valley and south of ruperts land more or less restoring the borders previously existing under french rule before the conquest the treaty of versailles ceded territories south of the great lakes to the united states after the constitutional act of  the territory was divided between lower canada present day quebec and upper canada present day ontario with each being granted an elected legislative assembly in  these become canada east and canada west after the british parliament unified upper and lower canada into the province of canada this territory was redivided into the provinces of quebec and ontario at confederation in  each became one of the first four provinces in  canada purchased ruperts land from the hudsons bay company and over the next few decades the parliament of canada transferred to quebec portions of this territory that would more than triple the size of the province in  the canadian parliament passed the first quebec boundary extension act that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the local aboriginal peoples this was followed by the addition of the district of ungava through the quebec boundaries extension act of  that added the northernmost lands of the inuit to create the modern province of quebec in  the border between quebec and newfoundland and labrador was established by the british judicial committee of the privy council quebec officially disputes this boundary geography main article geography of quebec map of quebec located in the eastern part of canada and from a historical and political perspective part of central canada quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of france or texas most of which is very sparsely populated its topography is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground the climate latitude and altitude and the proximity to water the saint lawrence lowland south and the canadian shield north are the two main topographic regions and are radically different hydrography quebec has one of the worlds largest reserves of fresh water occupying  of its surface it has  of the worlds renewable fresh water whereas it has only  of its population more than half a million lakes including  with an area greater than  square kilometres  sq mi and  rivers pour their torrents into the atlantic ocean through the gulf of saint lawrence and the arctic ocean by james hudson and ungava bays the largest inland body of water is the caniapiscau reservoir created in the realization of the james bay project to produce hydroelectric power lake mistassini is the largest natural lake in quebec michels falls on ashuapmushuan river in saintfélicien saguenay–lacsaintjean the saint lawrence river has some of the worlds largest sustaining inland atlantic ports at montreal the provinces largest city troisrivières and quebec city the capital its access to the atlantic ocean and the interior of north america made it the base of early french exploration and settlement in the th and th centuries since  the saint lawrence seaway has provided a navigable link between the atlantic ocean and the great lakes northeast of quebec city the river broadens into the worlds largest estuary the feeding site of numerous species of whales fish and seabirds the river empties into the gulf of saint lawrence this marine environment sustains fisheries and smaller ports in the lower saint lawrence bassaintlaurent lower north shore côtenord and gaspé gaspésie regions of the province the saint lawrence river with its estuary forms the basis of quebecs development through the centuries at the same time many affluent rivers testify to the exploration of land among them ashuapmushuan chaudière

known in english as mount caubvick located on the border with newfoundland and labrador in the northeastern part of the province in the torngat mountains the most populous physiographic region is the saint lawrence lowland it extends northeastward from the southwestern portion of the province along the shores of the saint lawrence river to the quebec city region limited to the north by the laurentian mountains and to the south by the appalachians it mainly covers the areas of the centreduquébec laval montérégie and montreal the southern regions of the capitalenationale lanaudière laurentides mauricie and includes anticosti island the mingan archipelago and other small islands of the gulf of st lawrence lowland forests ecoregion its landscape is lowlying and flat except for isolated igneous outcrops near montreal called the monteregian hills formerly covered by the waters of lake champlain the oka hills also rise from the plain geologically the lowlands formed as a rift valley about  million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes the most recent layers of sedimentary rock were formed as the seabed of the ancient champlain sea at the end of the last ice age about  years ago the combination of rich and easily arable soils and quebecs relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of quebec province mixed forests provide most of canadas springtime maple syrup crop the rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to settlement patterns in th century new france autumn landscape of hautegaspésie more than  of quebecs territory lies within the canadian shield it is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the laurentian mountains in southern quebec the otish mountains in central quebec and the torngat mountains near ungava bay the topography of the shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages which explains the glacial deposits of boulders gravel and sand and by sea water and postglacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the shield the canadian shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes bogs streams and rivers it is rich in the forestry mineral and hydroelectric resources that are a mainstay of the quebec economy primary industries sustain small cities in regions of abitibitémiscamingue saguenay–lacsaintjean and côtenord the canadian shield extends over most of quebecs land surface the labrador peninsula is covered by the laurentian plateau or canadian shield dotted with mountains such as otish mountains the ungava peninsula is notably composed of dyouville mountains puvirnituq mountains and pingualuit crater while low and medium altitude peak from western quebec to the far north high altitudes mountains emerge in the capitalenationale region to the extreme east along its longitude in the labrador peninsula portion of the shield the far northern region of nunavik includes the ungava peninsula and consists of flat arctic tundra inhabited mostly by the inuit further south lie the subarctic taiga of the eastern canadian shield taiga ecoregion and the boreal forest of the central canadian shield forests where spruce fir and poplar trees provide raw materials for quebecs pulp and paper and lumber industries although the area is inhabited principally by the cree naskapi and innu first nations thousands of temporary workers reside at radisson to service the massive james bay hydroelectric project on the la grande and eastmain rivers the southern portion of the shield extends to the laurentians a mountain range just north of the saint lawrence lowland that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts the appalachian region of quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of quebec the appalachians are actually a huge chain that extends from alabama to newfoundland in between it covers in quebec near  km  mi from the montérégie hills to the gaspé peninsula in western

population centres have a humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfb with four distinct seasons having warm to occasionally hot and humid summers and often very cold and snowy winters the main climatic influences are from western and northern canada and move eastward and from the southern and central united states that move northward because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of north america and the atlantic ocean precipitation is abundant throughout the year with most areas receiving more than  millimetres  in of precipitation including over  centimetres  in of snow in many areas during the summer severe weather patterns such as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms occur occasionally most of central quebec has a subarctic climate köppen dfc winters are long very cold and snowy and among the coldest in eastern canada while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of arctic air masses precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south except at some of the higher elevations the northern regions of quebec have an arctic climate köppen et with very cold winters and short much cooler summers the primary influences in this region are the arctic ocean currents such as the labrador current and continental air masses from the high arctic the four seasons in quebec are spring summer autumn and winter with conditions differing by region they are then differentiated according to the insolation temperature and precipitation of snow and rain at quebec city the length of the daily sunshine

of quebec cdpnqfrench acronym are the main agencies working with officers for wildlife conservation in quebec vegetation taiga forest in gaspé québec canada given the geology of the province and its different climates there is an established number of large areas of vegetation in quebec these areas listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are the tundra the taiga the canadian boreal forest coniferous mixed forest and deciduous forest on the edge of the ungava bay and hudson strait is the tundra whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of lichen with only less than  growing days a year the tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of − °c  °f the tundra covers more than  of the area of quebec further south the climate is conducive to the growth of the canadian boreal forest bounded on the north by the taiga the different forest areas of quebec not as arid as the tundra the taiga is associated with the subarctic regions of the canadian shield and is characterized by a greater number of both plant  and animal  species many of which live there all year the taiga covers about  of the total area of quebec the canadian boreal forest is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in quebec that straddle the canadian shield and the upper lowlands of the province given a warmer climate the diversity of organisms is also higher since there are about  plant species and  vertebrates species the canadian boreal forest covers  of the area of quebec the mixed forest is a transition zone between the canadian boreal forest and deciduous forest by virtue of its transient nature this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant  and vertebrates  species despite relatively cool temperatures the ecozone mixed forest covers  of the area of quebec and is characteristic of the laurentians the appalachians and the eastern lowlands forests the third most northern forest area is characterized by deciduous forests because of its climate average annual temperature of  °c  °f it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species including more than  vascular plants and  vertebrates its relatively long growing season lasts almost  days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of quebec most of quebecs population lives in this area of vegetation almost entirely along the banks of the st lawrence deciduous forests cover approximately  of the area of quebec the total forest area of quebec is estimated at  square kilometres  sq mi from the abitibitémiscamingue to the north shore the forest is composed primarily of conifers such as the abies balsamea the jack pine the white spruce the black spruce and the tamarack some species of deciduous trees such as the yellow birch appear when the river is approached in the south the deciduous forest of the saint lawrence lowlands is mostly composed of deciduous species such as the sugar maple the red maple the white ash the american beech the butternut white walnut the american elm the basswood the bitternut hickory and the northern red oak as well as some conifers such as the eastern white pine and the northern whitecedar the distribution areas of the paper birch the trembling aspen and the mountain ash cover more than half of quebec territory history main article history of quebec indigenous peoples and european exploration glacial lakes agassiz and ojibway  bpe at the time of first european contact and later colonization algonquian iroquois and inuit nations controlled what is now quebec their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived algonquians organized into seven political entities lived nomadic lives based on hunting gathering and fishing in the rugged terrain of the canadian shield james bay cree innu algonquins and appalachian mountains mikmaq abenaki st lawrence iroquoians a branch of the iroquois lived more settled lives growing corn beans and squash in the fertile soils of the st lawrence valley they appear to have been later supplanted by the mohawk nation the inuit continue to fish and hunt whale and seal in the harsh arctic climate along the coasts of hudson and ungava bay these people traded fur and food and sometimes warred with each other new france main article new france three huronwyandot chiefs from wendake in quebec new france had largely peaceful relations with the indigenous people such as their allies the huron after the defeat of the huron by their mutual enemies the iroquois many fled from ontario to quebec a depiction of jacques cartier by théophile hamel  no contemporary likeness of cartier has been found to exist around – the italian navigator giovanni da verrazzano persuaded king francis i of france to commission an expedition to find a western route to cathay china in  breton explorer jacques cartier planted a cross in the gaspé peninsula and claimed the land in the name of king francis i it was the first province of new france however initial french attempts at settling the region met with failure french fishing fleets however continued to sail to the atlantic coast and into the st lawrence river making alliances with first nations that would become important once france began to occupy the land samuel de champlain was part of a  expedition from france that travelled into the st lawrence river in  he returned as head of an exploration party and founded quebec city with the intention of making the area part of the french colonial empire champlains habitation de québec built as a permanent fur trading outpost was where he would forge a trading and ultimately a military alliance with the algonquin and huron nations first nations traded their furs for many french goods such as metal objects guns alcohol and clothing coureurs des bois voyageurs and catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the north american continent they establishing fur trading forts on the great lakes étienne brûlé  hudson bay radisson and groseilliers – ohio river and mississippi river la salle  as well as the saskatchewan river and missouri river de la verendrye – after  king louis xiii of france allowed the company of new france to introduced the seigneurial system and forbade settlement in new france by anyone other than roman catholics in  there was the surrender of quebec without battle to english privateers led by david kirke during the thirty years war however samuel de champlain argued that the english seizing of the lands was illegal as the war had already ended he worked to have the lands returned to france as part of the ongoing negotiations of their exit from the anglofrench war in  the english king charles agreed to return the lands in exchange for louis xiii paying his wifes dowry these terms were signed into law with the treaty of saintgermainenlaye the lands in quebec and acadia were returned to the french company of one hundred associates new france became a royal province in  under king louis xiv of france with a sovereign council that included intendant jean talon the population grew slowly under french rule thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births rather than by immigration to encourage population growth and to redress the severe imbalance between single men and women king louis xiv sponsored the passage of approximately  young french women known as les filles du roi to the colony most of the french were farmers canadiens or habitants and the rate of population growth among the settlers themselves was very high seven years war and capitulation of new france main article seven years war authorities in new france became more aggressive in their efforts to expel british traders and colonists from the ohio valley they began construction of a series of fortifications to protect the area in  george washington launched a surprise attack on a group of canadien soldiers sleeping in the early morning hours it came at a time when no declaration of war had been issued by either country this frontier aggression known as the jumonville affair set the stage for the french and indian war a us designation in canada it is usually referred to as the seven years war although french canadians often call it la guerre de la conquête the war of conquest in north america by  france and britain were battling the seven years war worldwide in  the british mounted an attack on new france by sea and took the french fort at louisbourg on september   the british forces of general james wolfe defeated those of french general louisjoseph de montcalm on the plains of abraham outside quebec city with the exception of the small islands of saint pierre and miquelon located off the coast of newfoundland france ceded its north american possessions to great britain through the treaty of paris  in favour of gaining the island of guadeloupe for its thenlucrative sugar cane industry the british royal proclamation of  renamed canada part of new france as the province of quebec quebec act main article quebec act the province of quebec in  with unrest growing in the colonies to the south which would one day grow into the american revolution the british were worried that the frenchspeaking canadians might also support the growing rebellion at that time frenchspeaking canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of quebec more than  and british immigration was not going well to secure the allegiance of the approximately  frenchspeaking canadians to the british crown first governor james murray and later governor guy carleton promoted the need for change there was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the frenchspeaking canadian subjects and those of newly arrived british subjects these efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the quebec act of  the quebec act provided the people of quebec their first charter of rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the french language and french culture the act also allowed canadiens to maintain french civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion allowing the roman catholic church to remain one of the first cases in history of statesanctioned freedom of religious practice effects of the american revolution although the quebec act was unrelated to the events in boston of  and was not regarded as one of the coercive acts the timing of its passage led british colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them the quebec act offended a variety of interest groups in the british colonies land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a nonrepresentative government many feared the establishment of catholicism in quebec and that the french canadians were being courted to help oppress british americans defending quebec from an american attack during the battle of quebec in december  on june   general george washington decided to attempt an invasion of canada by the american continental army to wrest quebec and the st lawrence river from the british the invasion failed when british reinforcements came down the st lawrence in may  and the battle of troisrivières turned into a disaster for the americans the army withdrew to ticonderoga although some help was given to the americans by the locals governor carleton punished american sympathizers and public support of the american cause came to an end in  frederick haldimand took over for guy carleton as governor of quebec the arrival of  loyalists at quebec in  destroyed the political balance that haldimand and carleton before him had worked so hard to achieve the swelling numbers of english encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government to restore stability to his largest remaining north american colony king george iii sent carleton back to quebec to remedy the situation in ten years quebec had undergone a dramatic change what worked for carleton in  was not likely to succeed in  specifically there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many english people unwilling to reach a compromise with the  canadiens or their colonial governor the situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving separation of the province of quebec a plan of the inhabited part of the province of quebec c  by james peachey peter winkworth collection library and archives canada e loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the british legal system they were used to in the american colonies the creation of upper and lower canada in  allowed most loyalists to live under british laws and institutions while the frenchspeaking population of lower canada could maintain their familiar french civil law and the catholic religion therefore governor haldimand at the suggestion of carleton drew loyalists away from quebec city and montreal by offering free land on the northern shore of lake ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to george iii the loyalists were thus given land grants of  acres  ha per person basically this approach was designed with the intent of keeping french and english as far apart as possible therefore after the separation of the province of quebec lower canada and upper canada were formed each with its own government patriotes rebellion in lower canada main article lower canada rebellion the burning of the parliament buildings in montreal occurred on the night of april   in  residents of lower canada – led by louisjoseph papineau and robert nelson – formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to the unilateral control of the british governors they made a declaration of rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination and a declaration of independence of lowercanada in  their actions resulted in rebellions in both lower and upper canada an unprepared british army had to raise militia force the rebel forces scored a victory in saintdenis but were soon defeated after the rebellions lord durham was asked to undertake a study and prepare a report on the matter and to offer a solution for the british parliament to assess following durhams report the british government merged the two colonial provinces into one province of canada in  with the act of union the two colonies remained distinct in administration election and law in  baldwin and lafontaine allies and leaders of the reformist party were asked by lord elgin to form an administration together under the new policy of responsible government the french language subsequently regained legal status in the legislature canadian confederation main article canadian confederation in the s the delegates from the colonies of british north america canada new brunswick nova scotia prince edward island and newfoundland met in a series of conferences to discuss selfgoverning status for a new confederation the first charlottetown conference took place in charlottetown prince edward island followed by the quebec conference in quebec city which led to a delegation going to london britain to put forth a proposal for a national union as a result of those deliberations in  the parliament of the united kingdom passed the british north america acts providing for the confederation of most of these provinces the former province of canada was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of ontario upper canada and quebec lower canada new brunswick and nova scotia joined ontario and quebec in the new dominion of canada

primarily by aboriginal peoples the climate around the major cities is fourseason continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions even in central quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are severe in inland areas quebec independence debates have played a large role in the politics of the province parti québécois governments held referendums on sovereignty in  and  both were voted down by voters the latter defeated by a very narrow margin in  the house of commons of canada passed a symbolic motion recognizing the québécois as a nation within a united canada while the provinces substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace information and communication technologies biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading

and ontario at confederation in  each became one of the first four provinces in  canada purchased ruperts land from the hudsons bay company and over the next few decades the parliament of canada transferred to quebec portions of this territory that would more than triple the size of the province in  the canadian parliament passed the first quebec boundary extension act that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the local aboriginal peoples this was followed by the addition of the district of ungava through the quebec boundaries extension act of  that

privy council quebec officially disputes this boundary geography main article geography of quebec map of quebec located in the eastern part of canada and from a historical and political perspective part of central canada quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of france or texas most of which is very sparsely populated its topography is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground the climate latitude and altitude and the proximity to water the saint lawrence lowland south and the canadian shield north are the two main topographic regions and are radically different hydrography quebec has one of the worlds largest reserves of fresh water occupying  of its surface it has  of the worlds renewable fresh water whereas it has only

the monteregian hills formerly covered by the waters of lake champlain the oka hills also rise from the plain geologically the lowlands formed as a rift valley about  million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes the most recent layers of sedimentary rock were formed as the seabed of the ancient champlain sea at the end of the last ice age about  years ago the combination of rich and easily arable soils and quebecs relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of quebec province mixed forests provide most of canadas springtime maple syrup crop the rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to settlement patterns in th century new france autumn landscape of hautegaspésie more than  of quebecs territory lies within the canadian shield it is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the laurentian mountains in southern quebec the otish mountains in central quebec and the torngat mountains near ungava bay the topography of the shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages which explains the glacial deposits of boulders gravel and sand and by sea water and postglacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the shield the canadian shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes bogs streams and rivers it is rich in the forestry mineral and hydroelectric resources that are a mainstay of the quebec economy primary industries sustain small cities in regions of abitibitémiscamingue saguenay–lacsaintjean and côtenord the canadian shield extends over most of quebecs land surface the labrador peninsula is covered by

eastern canadian shield taiga ecoregion and the boreal forest of the central canadian shield forests where spruce fir and poplar trees provide raw materials for quebecs pulp and paper and lumber industries although the area is inhabited principally by the cree naskapi and innu first nations thousands of temporary workers reside at radisson to service the massive james bay hydroelectric project on the la grande and eastmain rivers the southern portion of the shield extends to the laurentians a mountain range just north of the saint lawrence lowland that attracts local and

province of quebec in  with unrest growing in the colonies to the south which would one day grow into the american revolution the british were worried that the frenchspeaking canadians might also support the growing rebellion at that time frenchspeaking canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of quebec more than  and british immigration was not going well to secure the allegiance of the approximately  frenchspeaking canadians to the british crown first governor james murray and later governor guy carleton promoted the need for change there was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the frenchspeaking canadian subjects and those of newly arrived british subjects these efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the quebec act of  the quebec act provided the people of quebec their first charter of rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the french language and french culture the act also allowed canadiens to maintain french civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion allowing the roman catholic church to remain one of the first cases in history of statesanctioned freedom of religious practice effects of the american revolution although the quebec act was unrelated to the events in boston of  and was not regarded as one of the coercive acts the timing of its passage led british

that haldimand and carleton before him had worked so hard to achieve the swelling numbers of english encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government to restore stability to his largest remaining north american colony king george iii sent carleton back to quebec to remedy the situation in ten years quebec had undergone a dramatic change what worked for carleton in  was not likely to succeed in  specifically there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many english people unwilling to reach a compromise with the  canadiens or their colonial governor the situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving separation of the province of quebec a plan of the inhabited part of the province of quebec c  by james peachey peter winkworth collection library and archives canada e loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the british legal system they were used to in the american colonies the creation of upper and lower canada in  allowed most loyalists to live under british laws and institutions while the frenchspeaking population of lower canada could maintain their familiar french civil law and the catholic religion therefore governor haldimand at the suggestion of carleton drew loyalists away from quebec city and montreal by offering free land on the northern shore of lake ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to george iii the loyalists were thus given land grants of  acres  ha per person basically this approach was designed with the intent of keeping french and english as far apart as possible therefore after the separation of the province of quebec lower canada and upper canada were formed each with its own government patriotes rebellion

the monteregian hills formerly covered by the waters of lake champlain the oka hills also rise from the plain geologically the lowlands formed as a rift valley about  million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes the most recent layers of sedimentary rock were formed as the seabed of the ancient champlain sea at the end of the last ice age about  years ago the combination of rich and easily arable soils and quebecs relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of quebec province mixed forests provide most of canadas

autumn landscape of hautegaspésie more than  of quebecs territory lies within the canadian shield it is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the laurentian mountains in southern quebec the otish mountains in central quebec and the torngat mountains near ungava bay the topography of the shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages which explains the glacial deposits of boulders gravel and sand and by sea water and postglacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the shield the canadian shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes bogs streams and rivers it is rich in the forestry mineral and hydroelectric resources that are a mainstay of the quebec economy primary

established number of large areas of vegetation in quebec these areas listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are the tundra the taiga the canadian boreal forest coniferous mixed forest and deciduous forest on the edge of the ungava bay and hudson strait is the tundra whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of lichen with only less than  growing days a year the tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of − °c  °f the tundra covers more than  of the area of quebec further south the climate is conducive to the growth of the canadian boreal forest bounded on the north by the taiga the different forest areas of quebec not as arid as the tundra the taiga is associated with the subarctic regions of the canadian shield and is characterized by a greater number of both plant  and animal  species many of which live there all year the taiga covers about  of the total area of quebec the canadian boreal forest is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in quebec that straddle the canadian shield and the upper lowlands of the province given a warmer climate the diversity of organisms is also higher since there are about  plant species and  vertebrates species the canadian boreal forest covers  of the area of quebec the mixed forest is a transition zone between the canadian boreal forest and deciduous forest by virtue of its transient nature this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant  and vertebrates  species despite relatively cool temperatures the ecozone mixed forest covers  of the area of quebec and is characteristic of the laurentians the appalachians and the eastern lowlands forests the third most northern forest area is characterized by deciduous forests because of its climate average annual temperature of  °c  °f it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species including more than  vascular plants and  vertebrates its relatively long growing season lasts almost  days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of quebec most of quebecs population lives in this area of vegetation almost entirely along the banks of the st lawrence deciduous forests cover approximately  of the area of quebec the total forest area of quebec is estimated at  square kilometres  sq mi from the abitibitémiscamingue to the north shore the forest is composed primarily of conifers such as the abies balsamea the jack pine the white spruce the black spruce and the tamarack some species of deciduous trees such as the yellow birch appear when the river is approached in the south the deciduous forest of the saint lawrence lowlands is mostly composed of deciduous species such as the sugar maple the red maple the white ash the american beech the butternut white walnut the american elm the basswood the bitternut hickory and the northern red oak as well as some conifers such as the

french company of one hundred associates new france became a royal province in  under king louis xiv of france with a sovereign council that included intendant jean talon the population grew slowly under french rule thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births rather than by immigration to encourage population growth and to redress the severe imbalance

province of quebec in  with unrest growing in the colonies to the south which would one day grow into the american revolution the british were worried that the frenchspeaking canadians might also support the growing rebellion at that time frenchspeaking canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of quebec more than  and british immigration was not going well to secure the allegiance of the approximately  frenchspeaking canadians to the british crown first governor james murray and later governor guy carleton promoted the need for change there was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the frenchspeaking canadian subjects and those of newly arrived british subjects these efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the quebec act of  the quebec act provided the people of quebec their first charter of rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the french language and french culture the act also allowed canadiens to maintain french civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion allowing the roman catholic church to remain one of the first cases in history of statesanctioned freedom of religious practice effects of the american revolution although the quebec act was unrelated to the events in boston of  and was not regarded as one of the coercive acts the timing of its passage led british

that haldimand and carleton before him had worked so hard to achieve the swelling numbers of english encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government to restore stability to his largest remaining north american colony king george iii sent carleton back to quebec to remedy the situation in ten years quebec had undergone a dramatic change what worked for carleton in  was not likely to succeed in  specifically there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many english people unwilling to reach a compromise with the  canadiens or their colonial governor the situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving separation of the province of quebec a plan of the inhabited part of the province of quebec c  by james peachey peter winkworth collection library and archives canada e loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the british legal system they were used to in the american colonies the creation of upper and lower canada in  allowed most loyalists to live under british laws and institutions while the frenchspeaking population of lower canada could maintain their familiar french civil law and the catholic religion therefore governor haldimand at the suggestion of carleton drew loyalists away from quebec city and montreal by offering free land on the northern shore of lake ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to george iii the loyalists were thus given land grants of  acres  ha per person basically this approach was designed with the intent of keeping french and english as far apart as possible therefore after the separation of the province of quebec lower canada and upper canada were formed each with its own government patriotes rebellion

discrimination and a declaration of independence of lowercanada in  their actions resulted in rebellions in both lower and upper canada an unprepared british army had to raise militia force the rebel forces scored a victory in saintdenis but were soon defeated after the rebellions lord durham was asked to undertake a study and prepare a report on the matter and to offer a solution for the british parliament to assess following durhams report the british government merged the two colonial provinces into one province of canada in  with the act of union the two colonies remained distinct in

administrative division only the territory of nunavut is larger it is bordered to the west by the province of ontario james bay and hudson bay to the north by hudson strait and ungava bay to the east by the gulf of saint lawrence and the province of newfoundland and labrador and to the south by the province of new brunswick and the us states of maine new hampshire vermont and new york it also shares maritime borders with nunavut prince edward island and nova scotia most inhabitants live in urban areas near the saint lawrence river between montreal and quebec city the capital approximately half of quebec residents live in the greater montreal area including the island of montreal englishspeaking communities and englishlanguage institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of montreal but are also significantly present in the outaouais eastern townships and gaspé regions the nordduquébec region occupying the northern half of the province is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by aboriginal peoples the climate around the major cities is fourseason continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions even in central quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are severe in inland areas quebec independence debates have played a large role in the politics of the province parti québécois governments held referendums on sovereignty in  and  both were voted down by voters the latter defeated by a very narrow margin in  the house of commons of canada passed a symbolic motion recognizing the québécois as a nation within a united canada while the provinces substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace information and communication technologies biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading roles these many industries have all contributed to helping quebec become an economically influential province within canada second only to ontario in economic output contents  etymology and boundary

arrival of samuel de champlain the father of new france on the site of quebec city the name québec which comes from the algonquin word kébec meaning where the river narrows originally referred to the area around quebec city where the saint lawrence river narrows to a clifflined gap early variations in the spelling of the name included québecq levasseur  and kébec lescarbot  french explorer samuel de champlain chose the name québec in  for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the french colony of new france the province is sometimes referred to as la belle province the beautiful province the province of quebec was founded in the royal proclamation of  after the treaty of paris formally transferred the french colony of canada to britain after the seven years war the proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the saint lawrence river the quebec act of  expanded the territory of the province to include the great lakes and the ohio river valley and south of ruperts land more or less restoring the borders previously existing under french rule before the conquest the treaty of versailles ceded territories south of the great lakes to the united states after the constitutional act of  the territory was divided between lower canada present day quebec and upper canada present day ontario with each being granted an elected legislative assembly in  these become canada east and canada west after the british parliament unified upper and lower canada into the province of canada this territory was redivided into the provinces of quebec and ontario at confederation in  each became one of the first four provinces in  canada purchased ruperts land from the hudsons bay company and over the next few decades the parliament of canada transferred to quebec portions of this territory that would more than triple the size of the province in  the canadian parliament passed the first quebec boundary extension act that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the local aboriginal peoples this was followed by the addition of the district of ungava through the quebec boundaries extension act of  that added the northernmost lands of the inuit to create the modern province of quebec in  the border between quebec and newfoundland and labrador was established by the british judicial committee of the privy council quebec officially disputes this boundary geography main article geography of quebec map of quebec located in the eastern part of canada and from a historical and political perspective part of central canada quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of france or texas most of which is very sparsely populated its topography is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground the climate latitude and altitude and the proximity to water the saint lawrence lowland south and the canadian shield north are the two main topographic regions and are radically different hydrography quebec has one of the worlds largest reserves of fresh water occupying  of its surface it has  of the worlds renewable fresh water whereas it has only  of its population more than half a million lakes including  with an area greater than  square kilometres  sq mi and  rivers pour their torrents into the atlantic ocean through the gulf of saint

located on the border with newfoundland and labrador in the northeastern part of the province in the torngat mountains the most populous physiographic region is the saint lawrence lowland it extends northeastward from the southwestern portion of the province along the shores of the saint lawrence river to the quebec city region limited to the north by the laurentian mountains and to the south by the appalachians it mainly covers the areas of the centreduquébec laval montérégie and montreal the southern regions of the capitalenationale lanaudière laurentides mauricie and includes anticosti island the mingan archipelago and other small islands of the gulf of st lawrence lowland forests ecoregion its landscape is lowlying and flat except for isolated igneous outcrops near montreal called the monteregian hills formerly covered by the waters of lake champlain the oka hills also rise from the plain geologically the lowlands formed as a rift valley about  million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes the most recent layers of sedimentary rock were formed as the seabed of the ancient champlain sea at the end of the last ice age about  years ago the combination of rich and easily arable soils and quebecs relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of quebec province mixed forests provide most of canadas springtime maple syrup crop the rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to settlement patterns in th century new france autumn landscape of hautegaspésie more than  of quebecs territory lies within the canadian shield it is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the laurentian mountains in southern quebec the otish mountains in central quebec and the torngat mountains near ungava bay the topography of the shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages which explains the glacial deposits of boulders gravel and sand and by sea water and postglacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the shield the canadian shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes bogs streams and rivers it is rich in the forestry mineral and hydroelectric resources that are a mainstay of the quebec economy primary industries sustain small cities in regions of abitibitémiscamingue saguenay–lacsaintjean and côtenord the canadian shield extends over most of quebecs land surface the labrador peninsula is covered by the laurentian plateau or canadian shield dotted with mountains such as otish mountains the ungava peninsula is notably composed of dyouville mountains puvirnituq mountains and pingualuit crater while low and medium altitude peak from western quebec to the far north high altitudes mountains emerge in the capitalenationale region to the extreme east along its longitude in the labrador peninsula portion of the shield the far northern region of nunavik includes the ungava peninsula and consists of flat arctic tundra inhabited mostly by the inuit further south lie the subarctic taiga of the eastern canadian shield taiga ecoregion and the boreal forest of the central canadian shield forests where spruce fir and poplar trees provide raw materials for quebecs pulp and paper and lumber industries although the area is inhabited principally by the cree naskapi and innu first nations thousands of temporary workers reside at radisson to service the massive james bay hydroelectric project on the la grande and eastmain rivers the southern portion of the shield extends to the laurentians a mountain range just north of the saint lawrence lowland that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts the appalachian region of quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of quebec the appalachians are actually a huge chain that extends from alabama to newfoundland in between it covers in quebec near  km  mi from the montérégie hills to the gaspé peninsula in western quebec the average altitude is about

continental climate köppen climate classification dfb with four distinct seasons having warm to occasionally hot and humid summers and often very cold and snowy winters the main climatic influences are from western and northern canada and move eastward and from the southern and central united states that move northward because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of north america

the summer severe weather patterns such as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms occur occasionally most of central quebec has a subarctic climate köppen dfc winters are long very cold and snowy and among the coldest in eastern canada while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of arctic air masses precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south except at some of the higher elevations the northern regions of quebec have an arctic climate köppen et with very cold winters and short much cooler summers the primary influences in this region are the arctic ocean currents such as the labrador current and continental air masses from the high arctic the four seasons in quebec are spring summer autumn and winter with conditions differing by

main agencies working with officers for wildlife conservation in quebec vegetation taiga forest in gaspé québec canada given the geology of the province and its different climates there is an established number of large areas of vegetation in quebec these areas listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are the tundra the taiga the canadian boreal forest coniferous mixed forest and deciduous forest on the edge of the ungava bay and hudson strait is the tundra whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of lichen with only less than  growing days a year the tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of − °c  °f the tundra covers more than  of the area of quebec further south the climate is conducive to the growth of the canadian boreal forest bounded on the north by the taiga the different forest areas of quebec not as arid as the tundra the taiga is associated with the subarctic regions of the canadian shield and is characterized by a greater number of both plant  and animal  species many of which live there all year the taiga covers about  of the total area of quebec the canadian boreal forest is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in quebec that straddle the canadian shield and the upper lowlands of the province given a warmer climate the diversity of organisms is also higher since there are about  plant species and  vertebrates species the canadian boreal forest covers  of the area of quebec the mixed forest is a transition zone between the canadian boreal forest and deciduous forest by virtue of its transient nature this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant  and vertebrates  species despite relatively cool temperatures the ecozone mixed forest covers  of the area of quebec and is characteristic of the laurentians the appalachians and the eastern lowlands forests the third most northern forest area is characterized by deciduous forests because of its climate average annual temperature of  °c  °f it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species including more than  vascular plants and  vertebrates its relatively long growing season lasts almost  days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of quebec most of quebecs population lives in this area of vegetation almost entirely along the banks of the st lawrence deciduous forests cover approximately  of the area of quebec the total forest area of quebec is estimated at  square kilometres  sq mi from the abitibitémiscamingue to the north shore the forest is composed primarily of conifers such as the abies balsamea the jack pine the white spruce the black spruce and the tamarack some species of deciduous trees such as the yellow birch appear when the river is approached in the south the deciduous forest of the saint lawrence lowlands is mostly composed of deciduous species such as the sugar maple the red maple the white ash the american beech the butternut white walnut the american elm the basswood the bitternut hickory and the northern red oak as well as some conifers such as the eastern white pine and the northern whitecedar the distribution areas of the paper birch the trembling aspen and the mountain ash cover more than half of quebec territory history main article history of quebec indigenous peoples and european exploration glacial lakes agassiz and ojibway  bpe at the time of first european contact and later colonization algonquian iroquois and inuit nations controlled what is now quebec their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived algonquians organized into seven political entities lived nomadic lives based on hunting gathering and fishing in the rugged terrain of the canadian shield james bay cree innu algonquins and appalachian mountains mikmaq abenaki st lawrence iroquoians a branch of the iroquois lived more settled lives growing corn beans and squash in the fertile soils of the st lawrence valley they appear to have been later supplanted by the mohawk nation the inuit continue to fish and hunt whale and seal in the harsh arctic climate along the coasts of hudson and ungava bay these people traded fur and food and sometimes warred with each other new france main article new france three huronwyandot chiefs from wendake in quebec new france had largely peaceful relations with the indigenous people such as their allies the huron after the defeat of the huron by their mutual enemies the iroquois many fled from ontario to quebec a depiction of jacques cartier by théophile hamel  no contemporary likeness of cartier has been found to exist around – the italian navigator giovanni da verrazzano persuaded king francis i of france to commission an expedition to find a western route to cathay china in  breton explorer jacques cartier planted a cross in the gaspé peninsula and claimed the land in the name of king francis i it was the first province of new france however initial french attempts at settling the region met with failure french fishing fleets however continued to sail to the atlantic coast and into the st lawrence river making alliances with first nations that would become important once france began to occupy the land samuel de champlain was part of a  expedition from france that travelled into the st lawrence river in  he returned as head of an exploration party and founded quebec city with the intention of making the area part of the french colonial empire champlains habitation de québec built as a permanent fur trading outpost was where he would forge a trading and ultimately a military alliance with the algonquin and huron nations first nations traded their furs for many french goods such as metal objects guns alcohol and clothing coureurs des bois voyageurs and catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the north american continent they establishing fur trading forts on the great lakes étienne brûlé  hudson bay radisson and groseilliers – ohio river and mississippi river la salle  as well as the saskatchewan river and missouri river de la verendrye – after  king louis xiii of france allowed the company of new france to introduced the seigneurial system and forbade settlement in new france by anyone other than roman catholics in  there was the surrender of quebec without battle to english privateers led by david kirke during the thirty years war however samuel de champlain argued that the english seizing of the lands was illegal as the war had already ended he worked to have the lands returned to france as part of the ongoing negotiations of their exit from the anglofrench war in  the english king charles agreed to return the lands in exchange for louis xiii paying his wifes dowry these terms were signed into law with the treaty of saintgermainenlaye the lands in quebec and acadia were returned to the french company of one hundred associates new france became a royal province in  under king louis xiv of france with a sovereign council that included intendant jean talon the population grew slowly under french rule thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births rather than by immigration to encourage population growth and to redress the severe imbalance between single men and women king louis xiv sponsored the passage of approximately  young french women known as les filles du roi to the colony most of the french were farmers canadiens or habitants and the rate of population growth among the settlers themselves was very high seven years war and capitulation of new france main article seven years war authorities in new france became more aggressive in their efforts to expel british traders and colonists from the ohio valley they began construction of a series of fortifications to protect the area in  george washington launched a surprise attack on a group of canadien soldiers sleeping in the early morning hours it came at a time when no declaration of war had been issued by either country this frontier aggression known as the jumonville affair set the stage for the french and indian war a us designation in canada it is usually referred to as the seven years war although french canadians often call it la guerre de la conquête the war of conquest in north america by  france and britain were battling the seven years war worldwide in  the british mounted an attack on new france by sea and took the french fort at louisbourg on september   the british forces of general james wolfe defeated those of french general louisjoseph de montcalm on the plains of abraham outside quebec city with the exception of the small islands of saint pierre and miquelon located off the coast of newfoundland france ceded its north american possessions to great britain through the treaty of paris  in favour of gaining the island of guadeloupe for its thenlucrative sugar cane industry the british royal proclamation of  renamed canada part of new france as the province of quebec quebec act main article quebec act the province of quebec in  with unrest growing in the colonies to the south which would one day grow into the american revolution the british were worried that the frenchspeaking canadians might also support the growing rebellion at that time frenchspeaking canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of quebec more than  and british immigration was not going well to secure the allegiance of the approximately  frenchspeaking canadians to the british crown first governor james murray and later governor guy carleton promoted the need for change there was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the frenchspeaking canadian subjects and those of newly arrived british subjects these efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the quebec act of  the quebec act provided the people of quebec their first charter of rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the french language and french culture the act also allowed canadiens to maintain french civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion allowing the roman catholic church to remain one of the first cases in history of statesanctioned freedom of religious practice effects of the american revolution although the quebec act was unrelated to the events in boston of  and was not regarded as one of the coercive acts the timing of its passage led british colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them the quebec act offended a variety of interest groups in the british colonies land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a nonrepresentative government many feared the establishment of catholicism in quebec and that the french canadians were being courted to help oppress british americans defending quebec from an american attack during the battle of quebec in december  on june   general george washington decided to attempt an invasion of canada by the american continental army to wrest quebec and the st lawrence river from the british the invasion failed when british reinforcements came down the st lawrence in may  and the battle of troisrivières turned into a disaster for the americans the army withdrew to ticonderoga although some help was given to the americans by the locals governor carleton punished american sympathizers and public support of the american cause came to an end in  frederick haldimand took over for guy carleton as governor of quebec the arrival of  loyalists at quebec in  destroyed the political balance that haldimand and carleton before him had worked so hard to achieve the swelling numbers of english encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government to restore stability to his largest remaining north american colony king george iii sent carleton back to quebec to remedy the situation in ten years quebec had undergone a dramatic change what worked for carleton in  was not likely to succeed in  specifically there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many english people unwilling to reach a compromise with the  canadiens or their colonial governor the situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving separation of the province of quebec a plan of the inhabited part of the province of quebec c  by james peachey peter winkworth collection library and archives canada e loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the british legal system they were used to in the

primarily by aboriginal peoples the climate around the major cities is fourseason continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions even in central quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are severe in inland areas quebec independence debates have played a large role in the politics of the province parti québécois governments held referendums on sovereignty in  and  both were voted down by voters the latter defeated by a very narrow margin in  the house of commons of canada passed a symbolic motion recognizing the québécois as a nation within a united canada while the provinces substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace information and communication technologies biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading

the beautiful province the province of quebec was founded in the royal proclamation of  after the treaty of paris formally transferred the french colony of canada to britain after the seven years war the proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the saint lawrence river the quebec act of  expanded the territory of the province to include the great lakes and the ohio river

and ontario at confederation in  each became one of the first four provinces in  canada purchased ruperts land from the hudsons bay company and over the next few decades the parliament of canada transferred to quebec portions of this territory that would more than triple the size of the province in  the canadian parliament passed the first quebec boundary extension act that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the local aboriginal peoples this was followed by the addition of the district of ungava through the quebec boundaries extension act of  that

privy council quebec officially disputes this boundary geography main article geography of quebec map of quebec located in the eastern part of canada and from a historical and political perspective part of central canada quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of france or texas most of which is very sparsely populated its topography is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground the climate latitude and altitude and the proximity to water the saint lawrence lowland south and the canadian shield north are the two main topographic regions and are radically different hydrography quebec has one of the worlds largest reserves of fresh water occupying  of its surface it has  of the worlds renewable fresh water whereas it has only  of its population more than half a million lakes including  with an area greater than  square kilometres  sq mi and  rivers pour their torrents into the atlantic ocean through the gulf of saint

island the mingan archipelago and other small islands of the gulf of st lawrence lowland forests ecoregion its landscape is lowlying and flat except for isolated igneous outcrops near montreal called the monteregian hills formerly covered by the waters of lake champlain the oka hills also rise from the plain geologically the lowlands formed as a rift valley about  million years ago and are prone to infrequent but significant earthquakes the most recent layers of sedimentary rock were formed as the seabed of the ancient champlain sea at the end of the last ice age about  years ago the combination of rich and easily arable soils and quebecs relatively warm climate makes this valley the most prolific agricultural area of quebec province mixed forests provide most of canadas springtime maple syrup crop the rural part of the landscape is divided into narrow rectangular tracts of land that extend from the river and date back to settlement patterns in th century new france autumn landscape of hautegaspésie more than  of quebecs territory lies within the canadian shield it is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the laurentian mountains in southern quebec the otish mountains in central quebec and the torngat mountains near ungava bay the topography of the shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages which explains the glacial deposits of boulders gravel and sand and by sea water and postglacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the shield the canadian shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes bogs streams and rivers it is rich in the forestry mineral and hydroelectric resources that are a mainstay of the quebec economy primary industries sustain small cities in regions of abitibitémiscamingue saguenay–lacsaintjean and côtenord the canadian shield extends over most of quebecs land surface the labrador peninsula is covered by

eastern canadian shield taiga ecoregion and the boreal forest of the central canadian shield forests where spruce fir and poplar trees provide raw materials for quebecs pulp and paper and lumber industries although the area is inhabited principally by the cree naskapi and innu first nations thousands of temporary workers reside at radisson to service the massive james bay hydroelectric project on the la grande and eastmain rivers the southern portion of the shield extends to the laurentians a mountain range just north of the saint lawrence lowland that attracts local and

vegetation survives an average annual temperature of − °c  °f the tundra covers more than  of the area of quebec further south the climate is conducive to the growth of the canadian boreal forest bounded on the north by the taiga the different forest areas of quebec not as arid as the tundra the taiga is associated with the subarctic regions of the canadian shield and is characterized by a greater number of both plant  and animal  species many of which live there all year the taiga covers about  of the total area of quebec the canadian boreal forest is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in quebec that straddle the canadian shield and the upper lowlands of the province given a warmer climate the diversity of organisms is also higher since there are about  plant species and  vertebrates species the canadian boreal forest covers  of the area of quebec the mixed forest is a transition zone between the canadian boreal forest and deciduous forest by virtue of its transient nature this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant  and vertebrates  species despite relatively cool temperatures the ecozone mixed forest covers  of the area of quebec and is characteristic of the laurentians the appalachians and the eastern lowlands forests the third most northern forest area is characterized by deciduous forests because of its climate average annual temperature of  °c  °f it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species including more than  vascular plants and  vertebrates its relatively long growing season lasts almost  days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of quebec most of quebecs population lives in this area of vegetation almost

french company of one hundred associates new france became a royal province in  under king louis xiv of france with a sovereign council that included intendant jean talon the population grew slowly under french rule thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births rather than by immigration to encourage population growth and to redress the severe imbalance

province of quebec in  with unrest growing in the colonies to the south which would one day grow into the american revolution the british were worried that the frenchspeaking canadians might also support the growing rebellion at that time frenchspeaking canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of quebec more than  and british immigration was not going well to secure the allegiance of the approximately  frenchspeaking canadians to the british crown first governor james murray and later governor guy carleton promoted the need for change there was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the frenchspeaking canadian subjects and those of newly arrived british subjects these efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the quebec act of  the quebec act provided the people of quebec their first charter of rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the french language and french culture the act also allowed canadiens to maintain french civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion allowing the roman catholic church to remain one of the first cases in history of statesanctioned freedom of religious practice effects of the american revolution although the quebec act was unrelated to the events in boston of  and was not regarded as one of the coercive acts the timing of its passage led british colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them the quebec act offended a variety of interest groups in the british colonies land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a nonrepresentative government many feared the establishment of catholicism in quebec and that the french canadians were being

public support of the american cause came to an end in  frederick haldimand took over for guy carleton as governor of quebec the arrival of  loyalists at quebec in  destroyed the political balance that haldimand and carleton before him had worked so hard to achieve the swelling numbers of english encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government to restore stability to his largest remaining north american colony king george iii sent carleton back to quebec to remedy the situation in ten years quebec had undergone a dramatic change what worked for carleton in  was not likely to succeed in  specifically there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many english people unwilling to reach a compromise with the  canadiens or their colonial governor the situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving separation of the province of quebec a plan of the inhabited part of the province of quebec c  by james peachey peter winkworth collection library and archives canada e loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the british legal system they were used to in the american colonies the creation of upper and lower canada in  allowed most loyalists to live under british laws and institutions while the frenchspeaking population of lower canada could maintain their familiar french civil law and the catholic religion therefore governor haldimand at the suggestion of carleton drew loyalists away from quebec city and montreal by offering free land on the northern shore of lake ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to george iii the loyalists were thus given land grants of  acres  ha per person basically this approach was designed with the intent of keeping french and english as far apart as possible therefore after the separation of the province of quebec lower canada and upper canada were formed each with its own government patriotes rebellion

discrimination and a declaration of independence of lowercanada in  their actions resulted in rebellions in both lower and upper canada an unprepared british army had to raise militia force the rebel forces scored a victory in saintdenis but were soon defeated after the rebellions lord durham was asked to undertake a study and prepare a report on the matter and to offer a solution for the british parliament to assess following durhams report the british government merged the two colonial provinces into one province of canada in  with the act of union the two colonies remained distinct in

from this single ingredient legend tells of a native north american observing an energetic squirrel drinking the water of a maple tree  was this the actual discovery that led to maple products as we

the international standard for maple today maple products from québec are exported to more than  countries québec provides  of world production back next video of wxfykjmux watch the videolocate quebec from the forest maple products from québec come from a single ingredient the sap of maple trees the flow of sap is a natural phenomenon unique to north america it occurs each spring when daytime and nighttime temperatures alternate above and below freezing québec maple producers collect the sap and take it to the sugar shack for evaporation and processing into maple products it’s a complex process that demands knowledge and precision   in summertime maple trees produce sugar through photosynthesis sugar allows the trees’ cells to breathe promotes growth and accumulates starch in the roots in the spring the alternating freezethaw cycle between night and day promotes the flow of maple sap at night the cold freezes the tree’s branches causing the gasses in their fibres to contract the sap also freezes but contrary to the gas it expands in the tree fibres all night the water absorbed by the roots rises up through the trunk and as it does so distributes the sugar reserves when the sun comes up the temperature rises and the tree branches thaw the daytime warmth returns the sap to liquid state and the gas in the tree fibres expands again this creates pressure and the sugary sap is pushed through the trunk and this is how sap flows through the maple tree   traditionally maple sap in québec was collected in pails hung on the trees the maple producer would pour the maple water that dripped out into larger containers and drive them back to the sugar shack it’s a lot different today for the most part maple water is gathered through a system of tubing attached to the trees by small nicks the tubes connect to larger conveyance tubes that carry the maple water by gravity or pumping to the sugar shack the maple water comes to huge stainless steel containers and sent to a reverse osmosis unit or directly to the evaporator before being set to boil and become maple syrup it takes an average of  litres of maple water to make  litre of syrup reverse osmosis ro is a technology that concentrates sugar in the sap helping to increase it for example from  to  this step reduces heating costs and the environmental impact of boiling maple water

know that maple products from québec even stimulate umami the “fifth taste” whose discovery has revolutionized the culinary world   maple and umami umami is one of the five basic tastes along with salty sweet bitter and sour in contrast to the other tastes umami meaning pleasant savory taste in japanese is more complex to describe and understand one theory says maillard reactions cause perception of the umami taste these are chemical reactions that occur between amino acids and sugar when food is being cooked they’re the direct cause of browning and flavour formation after cooking maple products are made by the heating of maple sap maillard reactions can therefore be traced back to this process where umami occurs with maple’s aromatic compounds this is why maple products from québec enhance the flavours of other foods and are now found on the world’s finest tables maple’s complex aromas give chefs the ability to create dishes with new and original tastes surprisingly perhaps maple products from québec are chemically compatible with several essential ingredients found in japanese cuisine for example food cooked with maple syrup mirin and soy sauce has a decidedly enriched flavour other maillard reactions occur when maple sugar reacts with the amino acids of mirin and soy a striking example of umami in action maple and umami fact sheets find technical and

the laurentian mountains in southern quebec the otish mountains in central quebec and the torngat mountains near ungava bay the topography of the shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages which explains the glacial deposits of boulders gravel and sand and by sea water and postglacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the shield the canadian shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes bogs streams and rivers it is rich in the forestry mineral and hydroelectric resources that are a mainstay of the quebec economy primary

vegetation survives an average annual temperature of − °c  °f the tundra covers more than  of the area of quebec further south the climate is conducive to the growth of the canadian boreal forest bounded on the north by the taiga the different forest areas of quebec not as arid as the tundra the taiga is associated with the subarctic regions of the canadian shield and is characterized by a greater number of both plant  and animal  species many of which live there all year the taiga covers about  of the total area of quebec the canadian boreal forest is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in quebec that straddle the canadian shield and the upper lowlands of the province given a warmer climate the diversity of organisms is also higher since there are about  plant species and  vertebrates species the canadian boreal forest covers  of the area of quebec the mixed forest is a transition zone between the canadian boreal forest and deciduous forest by virtue of its transient nature this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant  and vertebrates  species despite relatively cool temperatures the ecozone mixed forest covers  of the area of quebec and is characteristic of the laurentians the appalachians and the eastern lowlands forests the third most northern forest area is characterized by deciduous forests because of its climate average annual temperature of  °c  °f it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species including more than  vascular plants and  vertebrates its relatively long growing season lasts almost  days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanization of quebec most of quebecs population lives in this area of vegetation almost entirely along the banks of the st lawrence deciduous forests cover approximately  of the area of quebec the total forest area of quebec is estimated at  square kilometres  sq mi from the

french company of one hundred associates new france became a royal province in  under king louis xiv of france with a sovereign council that included intendant jean talon the population grew slowly under french rule thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births rather than by immigration to encourage population growth and to redress the severe imbalance

province of quebec in  with unrest growing in the colonies to the south which would one day grow into the american revolution the british were worried that the frenchspeaking canadians might also support the growing rebellion at that time frenchspeaking canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of quebec more than  and british immigration was not going well to secure the allegiance of the approximately  frenchspeaking canadians to the british crown first governor james murray and later governor guy carleton promoted the need for change there was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the frenchspeaking canadian subjects and those of newly arrived british subjects these efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the quebec act of  the quebec act provided the people of quebec their first charter of rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the french language and french culture the act also allowed canadiens to maintain french civil law and sanctioned freedom of religion allowing the roman catholic church to remain one of the first cases in history of statesanctioned freedom of religious practice effects of the american revolution although the quebec act was unrelated to the events in boston of  and was not regarded as one of the coercive acts the timing of its passage led british colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them the quebec act offended a variety of interest groups in the british colonies land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a nonrepresentative government many feared the establishment of catholicism in quebec and that the french canadians were being

that haldimand and carleton before him had worked so hard to achieve the swelling numbers of english encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government to restore stability to his largest remaining north american colony king george iii sent carleton back to quebec to remedy the situation in ten years quebec had undergone a dramatic change what worked for carleton in  was not likely to succeed in  specifically there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many english people unwilling to reach a compromise with the  canadiens or their colonial governor the situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving separation of the province of quebec a plan of the inhabited part of the province of quebec c  by james peachey peter winkworth collection library and archives canada e loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the british legal system they were used to in the american colonies the creation of upper and lower canada in  allowed most loyalists to live under british laws and institutions while the frenchspeaking population of lower canada could maintain their familiar french civil law and the catholic religion therefore governor haldimand at the suggestion of carleton drew loyalists away from quebec city and montreal by offering free land on the northern shore of lake ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to george iii the loyalists were thus given land grants of  acres  ha per person basically this approach was designed with the intent of keeping french and english as far apart as possible therefore after the separation of the province of quebec lower canada and upper canada were formed each with its own government patriotes rebellion

discrimination and a declaration of independence of lowercanada in  their actions resulted in rebellions in both lower and upper canada an unprepared british army had to raise militia force the rebel forces scored a victory in saintdenis but were soon defeated after the rebellions lord durham was asked to undertake a study and prepare a report on the matter and to offer a solution for the british parliament to assess following durhams report the british government merged the two colonial provinces into one province of canada in  with the act of union the two colonies remained distinct in

population compositionof the total population of quebec nearly half are descendants of the  original french settlers québécois constitute more than fourfifths of canada’s total francophone population about onetenth of quebecers are anglophones of british descent another tenth of the population is of neither french nor british descent and includes aboriginal peoples indian first nations and inuit eastern europeans portuguese greeks haitians and asians notably from southeast asia in  french was made the official language of quebec and this was reaffirmed and strengthened in bill  the charter of the french language in the aboriginal peoples that were quebec’s first inhabitants are usually classified into three main linguistic groups the algonquian the inuit eskimoaleut and the iroquoian indian and inuit the arctic people of canada known as eskimo in the united states affairs in canada are under federal jurisdiction but with the transfer of certain responsibilities to the province it falls to the quebec government to provide services for the inuit populationanother distinctive characteristic of quebec is its religious homogeneity an overwhelming majority of the population still claims to be roman catholic while only a small proportion belongs to protestant denominations during the period of new france – roman catholicism was the official religion and french protestants were prevented from settling in the colony after  freedom of religious practice was authorized by the british government in the early th century the french canadian catholic church gained recognition from the british authorities and its leaders were permitted to increase the number of religious orders by the s the church built funded and administered all of the educational social and health institutions required by quebec’s roman catholic population during the irish potato famine of the s and early ’s a large number of irish catholics migrated to canada some of whom settled in quebec with the coming of other nationality groups before world i and after world war ii—notably italians germans poles portuguese filipinos and haitians—the proportion of roman catholics increased as a result of the arrival of jews in the early th century and after world war ii and the influx of asians and africans since the s all of the world’s principal religious denominations are represented in quebec not until the s was the catholic church’s influence over the governance of the province substantially reduced there is considerable historical debate as to whether that influence was positive or negative formal separation of church and state occurred in  with the replacement of the dual catholic and protestant school systems with french and englishlanguage school systems this step confirmed that religion is no longer a dominant social or political force in quebecsettlement patternsfrench and later british settlers built communities in the st lawrence lowlands accessible areas of the appalachian uplands and the far southern parts of the laurentians more than fourfifths of quebec’s population now lives within an area about  miles  km long and roughly  miles  km wide stretching from quebec city to montreal this corridor has one of the highest concentrations of population in canada about fourfifths of all quebecers live in towns a very small number are classified as rural farmers and the balance of the population is scattered in small settlements focused on forestry fishing mining and other types of activity the historical movement of the population in quebec has been from large numbers of scattered diversified settlements to an increasing concentration in a few urban areas the shortage of fertile land suitable for cultivation prevented the development of a truly agricultural economythe rural settlements were created under a variation of the french seigneurial system of landlords and tenants under which the latter who came to be called habitants had considerable autonomy because land was plentiful and because they could supplement their livelihood with work in the fur trade or in the burgeoning forestry industry after  these dispersed rural settlements which existed during and after the period of french control were limited to the banks of the st lawrence forming a continuous line between the urban centres of montreal and quebec city outside of quebec city troisrivières and montreal the land was divided into long narrow individual strips habitant families built houses at the end of each of these strips on the side of a road which eventually created nascent villages thereby forming a type of ribbon settlement pattern as each river road became fully settled a parallel road was opened farther inland a process that was repeated until the whole of the st lawrence lowlands was occupied as a result rural quebec had no formal villages until the late th century and most rural parishes controlled by the catholic church were created during the th century this system of colonization in which houses were located equidistantly along a road allowed for maximum settlement density but was responsible along with the seigneurial system for delaying the introduction of commercial agricultural activities even when the regional and international markets developed the demise of the seigneurial system in the s and the advent of railroads in the s and ’s brought about an agricultural revolution based on feed grains and hay that sustained dairy farming and the raising of livestockthe appalachian region was first inhabited by abenaki people the southeastern corner of the province that includes the towns of granby sherbrooke and magog is known as the eastern townships which were originally settled by loyalists seeking asylum during the american revolution in what remained british territory settlement of the eastern townships was by freehold tenure and this attracted considerable numbers of british settlers following the end of the war of  throughout the latter half of the th century a great many american and british settlers sold out to french canadian habitants who received encouragement and financial support from french canadian catholic colonization societiesthe very rapid urbanization of the province prior to world war ii relied heavily on british and european immigration the migration of french canadian families to montreal and other quebec cities did not entail the breakdown of a traditional peasant society since no such society existed for the large majority of rural quebecers the rural catholic french canadian communities comprised largely of habitants and day labourers experienced serious outmigration beginning in the s and accelerating dramatically over the next three decades although relatively isolated selfsubsistent rural and fishing settlements existed on the north shore of the st lawrence and in mining and foresting settlements in the laurentians and throughout northwestern quebec these communities did not constitute—as was claimed by the chicago school of sociologists of the s see robert e park—a distinctive “folk” society that overly influenced the cultural orientation of the mainstream rural french canadian catholic society these vibrant agroforestry communities continued to expand as long as the mining and forestry industries thrived which was the case in most regions well into the th centurybecause of the present distribution of the population quebec can be thought of as divided between metropolitan montreal—which includes the city of laval on jesus island to the north and several communities on the south shore—with more than twofifths of the population and the remainder of the province although there are other fairly substantial urban communities including quebec city chicoutimijonquière troisrivières and the ottawa ontariogatineau conurbation the divide between montreal and the rest of quebec remains the most significant demographic division the dichotomy is most evident when outlying regions of the province are compared with montreal the gaspé peninsula is the poorest and least urbanized region in quebec nearly onefifth of its population earns its living through agriculture fishing forestry and tourism in the summer months while the unemployment rate remains consistently higher than of that of montreal or of several other regions of quebecpetit cap a fishing village on the gaspé peninsula in quebeced coopershostal associatesdemographic trendsthe size of quebec’s and canada’s francophone populations is somewhat surprising given that france actively discouraged immigration during the colonial period and that most french protestants fled to other parts of europe rather than the new world the growth of the francophone population in canada is largely due to the high birth rate among all french canadian and acadian catholics from the s to the midth century between  and  the average yearly rate of birth was around – per  inhabitants while the death rate was relatively low for the time – per  after  this extremely rapid natural growth of the population continued climbing from  in  to  in  to  by —all of this despite the outmigration of  french canadians to the new england states between  and in the  census more than  percent of quebec’s population was classified as urban but it was not until the  census that a majority of the french canadian community was designated as urban the birth rate declined to about  per  while the death rate hovered around  per  from then on both figures declined steadily especially the death rate beginning in the late s the introduction of the birth control pill drastically affected the birth rate now the birth rate in quebec is among the lowest in the country the infant mortality rate is among the lowest in the worldother types of demographic changes have also been taking place the large majority of anglophones and members of ethniccultural minorities called allophones reside in the central and western sections of montreal island québécois nationalists have expressed concerns that as increasing numbers of welloff middleclass francophone montrealers move to the suburban communities in laval the west island and the south shore the old city of montreal will become as it was in the midth century an englishspeaking city the provincial government responded in  by merging all the municipalities on the island into the new megacity of montreal so as to preserve its status as the largest frenchspeaking city in north america this action proved unpopular however and in  many of the majority englishspeaking municipalities regained their independent statuseconomyfrom its origins in the early th century until the midth century quebec’s economy was based on french and then british mercantilism the economy of new france relied on a heavily subsidized fur trade and the military establishment agriculture remained undeveloped as there was no market in france for quebec’s products when the british took over in  the production of cereal grains in old quebec rose but then declined rapidly after  for economic cultural and political reasons british merchants who had displaced french canadian fur trade merchants by the s used the profits from commercial capitalism—comprising wheat and timber exports and luxury imports—as well as british taxes to make the st lawrence system navigable and to establish muchneeded financial institutions aided by steamships that plied the north atlantic the st lawrence and its tributaries and the great lakes montreal became a major north american transshipment port for vast amounts of products entering and leaving british north america and much of the midwestern united stateswhen the british abandoned mercantilism in the s the way was open for british canadian and then american businessmen to exploit quebec’s natural resources and to foster industrial capital owing to the transportation revolution brought on by steamships and then railways the montreal region developed a manufacturing sector based on producing small to mediumscale domestic necessities including hardware clothing textiles boots and shoes and wood products as in the maritime and ontario regions output and employment in manufacturing continued to expand until the swith the advent of the international movement toward freer trade following world war ii quebec’s economy has been characterized by a transformation of the natural resource sector through technological innovation by the ongoing demise of its labourintensive lowwage manufacturing sector by the emergence of its pharmaceutical and aeronautics industries and by the rapid expansion of the transportation communication service and knowledge industriesagriculture forestry and fishingthe concentration of population in the southern part of quebec developed in response to the fine level soils of the lowlands and the undulating morainecovered plateaus of the appalachian region the lowlands are used largely for producing feed grains and for the lucrative dairy industry the eastern townships region is another dairying centre although only about half the land there is arable maple sugar and maple syrup provide additional income tobacco until recently was grown on the sandy soils of the joliette area north of montreal vegetables were grown in the area of muck soil south of montreal and apples were produced on the slopes of the monteregian hills the gaspé peninsula and the canadian shield region provide only limited opportunities for agriculture because the soil is poor and the growing season is too shortforestry is one of quebec’s key economic resources forests with economic potential cover about half of the province and more than half of that forested land is exploited only about oneseventh of the timberlands are privately owned the remaining crown lands are managed by the government which conducts an active reforestation program linked to this large renewable resource is the province’s pulp and paper industry which has encountered difficulties due to a global drop in demand for paper and paper productsthe fur trade has played a part in the economy of quebec since the beginning of the french regime and is still important today in the ungava region which is populated by the inuit mink easily ranks first in production and other commercially viable species include beaver fox lynx otter and chinchillamaritime fisheries are important in the gaspé peninsula on the north shore and in the magdalen islands the quebec department of industry and commerce operates a network of coldstorage plants principal species include cod herring redfish lobster and salmon but the annual catch is small compared with those of the four atlantic provinces in canadaresources and powerthe future of quebec’s economic development was for a long time linked to the exploitation of resources in the canadian shield the first region of the shield to be exploited for minerals was the rouynnoranda rich in copper zinc gold and silver deposits continued demand for copper driven by the expansive electrical industry resulted in the opening of mines in the gaspé region for a time asbestos from communities in the eastern townships supplied nearly twothirds of the world’s needs between  and  mineral production increased  times in gross dollar value not accounting for inflation this rather spectacular development was due to the discovery of some of the world’s largest iron ore deposits in the ungava region in  two new towns schefferville and gagnon were created in the north as a result and a large port at septîles was developed with the opening of the st lawrence seaway in  the bulk of the iron ore was shipped to steel mills in the united states but this resource is now all but depleted other important minerals extracted in the province include titanium columbian tellurium clay limestone granite mica and sand and gravel in the s and early ’s a steady decline in the demand and prices for minerals made times difficult for mining communities throughout quebec the always volatile mining industry has recovered somewhat since the late s but not sufficiently to raise employment significantly rural communities dependent upon natural resource exploitation continue to experience outmigration and high levels of unemploymentcopper mines of rouynnoranda quecourtesy of tourisme quebecone of quebec’s most important natural resources is water which is harnessed for hydroelectric power until the s only a few large

onefourth of canada’s total manufacturing output as with many other regions in north america quebec’s industrial economy experienced significant structural changes in the last half of the th century and at the beginning of the st declining tariffs increased global competition and the lack of capital to modernize outmoded and inefficient industries have contributed to a process of deindustrialization in the early s manufacturing employed about onethird of quebec’s workforce and accounted for about onethird of the gross domestic product gdp by the mids the sector employed less than onefifth of the total workforce and generated about onefifth of gdp the leading components of the province’s manufacturing sector are food production paper and paper products transportation equipment primary metals chemical and pharmaceutical products and refined petroleum and coal products the industrial core of the province is in greater montreal where an increase in the number of computerrelated companies is transforming the manufacturing sectorservices labour and taxationquebec finances its governmental programs and administration with revenues from two sources the province collects a range of direct and indirect taxes and it also receives grants from the national government to assist it in improving public sector services in the mids the unemployment rate for quebec was

system of canada and of north america by virtue of the st lawrence seaway which allows ships to travel more than  miles  km from the north atlantic to the ports of the great lakes montreal is both a
