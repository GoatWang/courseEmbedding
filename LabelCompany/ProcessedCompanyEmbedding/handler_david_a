sell us your books best books of the month kindle ebooks david handler i was born and raised in los angeles and wrote two critically acclaimed novels about growing up there kiddo and boss before i resorted to a life of crime fictionmy first foray which you may remember featured the dapper celebrity ghostwriter stewart hoagy hoag and his faithful neurotic basset hound lulu i wrote eight novels between the years  and  about hoagy a fallen literary wunderkind turned pen for hire who travels the underbelly of show business helping famous stars tell their life stories secrets and all generally there are plenty of people who wanted those secrets to stay safely buried generally our jaded hero knows how to dig them out my first hoagy the man who died laughing was nominated for an anthony award my best known in the series the man who would be f scott fitzgerald won an edgar and an american mystery award im thrilled to report that ive revived the series and my newest hoagy the girl with kaleidoscope eyes will be published in august of  by william morrow i couldnt be more excited about this book which sends hoagy and lulu out to hollywood in search of richard aintree the legendary american novelist who disappeared more than  years ago it also brings hoagy in contact with aintrees daughter reggie who just happens to be the first great love of his life want to catch up thanks to the good folks at mysteriouspresscom and open road media all eight of my hoagy novels are now available on kindle check em out youll never find another wisecracking hero quite like hoagy a lot of my insights into the world of show business came from the  years i spent writing for television and films on both coasts remember the sitcom kate and allie with jane curtin and susan st james i was a member of the original writing staff that created that showthese days i live in a yearold carriage house in a quaint ultrawaspy little historic new england village not surprisingly i ended up launching a second mystery series that takes place here over the past fifteen years ive written eleven retrocozy murder mysteries set in a quaint ultrawaspy little historic new england village i call it dorset its a place where everyone knows everything about everyone  or at least they think they do trust me they dont dorset is a place full of secrets many of them deadly thats where my deliciously mismatched heroes come in both of them strangers in a very strange land mitch berger a pudgy jewish widower is the lead film critic for the most prestigious and therefore lowest paying of new yorks three daily newspapers desiree mitry is an alluring beautiful connecticut state trooper who happens to be black a gifted artist and strangely drawn to mitch under normal circumstances these are two people whose paths would never cross but absolutely nothing about dorset is normal i started the series in  with the cold blue blood which was nominated for a dilys award my latest the lavender lane lothario was published in february of  you absolutely dont have to read the bergermitry books in order but youll find it a kick to follow the unfolding romance if you do personally ive found them to be a real treat i get a chance to dissect the village and the people where i actually live absolutely everyone in town reads them and i have fun bringing my own subversive contemporary edge to the classic oldschool village murder mystery the books feel real fresh to me i hope you like them in the summer of  i launched another series featuring the feisty pound new york city private eye benji golden benji specializes in finding missing teenagers the first novel in the series is called runaway man i published a sequel phantom angel in  i promise you will love benjido you like political thrillers if so i took some time off between series a few years back to coauthor an international bestselling pageturner called gideon under the name russell andrews i promise you itll knock your socks off ive also taken the time to write some short fiction three have been included in anthologies  opening shots volume two edited by lawrence block a hot and sultry night for crime edited by
