comments the gold report interview with ralph aldis  comstock mining inc has assembled an extremely interesting land package in the historic comstock district it is looking at a potential pit at its

geologic map south gold hill is in the center left where dt is diorite and hi is andesite the comstock lode is a lode of silver ore located under the eastern slope of mount davidson a peak in the virginia range in nevada then western utah territory it was the first major discovery of silver ore in the united states after the discovery was made public in  it sparked a silver rush of prospectors to the area scrambling to stake their claims the discovery caused considerable excitement in california and throughout the united states the greatest since the california gold rush in  mining camps soon thrived in the vicinity which became bustling commercial centers including virginia city and gold hill the comstock lode is notable not just for the immense fortunes it generated and the large role those fortunes had in the growth of nevada and san francisco but also for the advances in mining technology that it spurred such as square set timbering and the washoe process for extracting silver from ore the mines declined after  although underground mining continued sporadically into the s contents  geology  bonanzas  discovery of silver  grosh brothers  gold hill discovery  ophir

miners called porphyry the fault fissures filled these fissures with mineralbearing quartz the miners stated porphyry makes ore the ore bodies were thinly scattered through the wide lode like plums in a charity pudding and nearly all of them were found in the wide upper section and along or near the east wall although the miners extended their work in all directions only sixteen large and rich ore bodies were found most less than  feet in depth– bonanzasedit six major bonanzas marked the first five years of the comstock lode the ophir bonanza was prosperous until  producing  tons though rich

 feet long and  feet wide but terminated at the  foot level–– discovery of silveredit bonanza ore consolidated california and virginia mine comstock lode gold was found in this region in the spring of  in gold canyon near presentday dayton by a company of mormon emigrants one of whom abner blackburn was their guide after arriving much too early to cross the sierra the wagon train camped on the carson river in the vicinity of dayton to wait for the mountain snow to melt william prouse also spelled prows soon found gold along the gravel river banks by panning but left when the mountains were passable as they anticipated taking out more gold on reaching california orr named the gulch gold cañón other emigrants followed camped in the canyon and went to work at mining however when the supply of water in the canyon gave out toward the end of summer they continued across the mountains to california the camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of – when about  men worked part of the year along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers long toms and sluices after nine years the gold canyon placers were producing less and many miners left for the mono lake placers the gold from gold canyon came from quartz veins toward the head of the vein in the vicinity of where silver city and gold hill now stand as the miners worked their way up the stream they founded the town of johntown on a plateau in  the johntown miners found gold in sixmile canyon which is about five miles  km north of gold canyon the heads of both these canyons form the north and south ends of what is now known as the comstock lode defined by the ophir discovery and the gold hill discovery– the early placer miners never worked out the location of the placer gold since the lode surface structure was largely worn away and covered with debris from the mountain sides above grosh brothersedit comstock miners s caption on original to labor is to pray credit for the discovery of the comstock lode is disputed it is said to have been discovered in  by ethan allen grosh and hosea ballou grosh sons of a pennsylvania clergyman trained mineralogists and veterans of the california gold fields hosea injured his foot and died of septicaemia in  in an effort to raise funds allen accompanied by an associate richard maurice bucke set out on a trek to california with samples and maps of his claim henry comstock was left in their stead to care for the grosh cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery grosh and bucke never made it to california getting lost and suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the sierra nevada mountains the two suffered from frostbite while crossing the sierras and at the hands of a minorsurgeon lost limbs through amputation a lastditch effort to save the lives of the pair allen grosh died on december   rm bucke lived but upon his recovery returned to his home in canada when henry t p comstock learned of the death of the grosh brothers he claimed the cabin and the lands as his own he also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man what he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein he continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the grosh brothers find was still unclaimed upon learning of a strike on gold hill which uncovered some bluish rock silver ore comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area gold hill discoveryedit four miners discovered the gold hill outcropping at the head of gold canyon making placer claims after finding traces of gold on  jan  they were james finney old virginny a contemporary rumor was that he changed his name from fennimore to finney after murdering a man john bishop big french john aleck henderson and jack yount these claims were followed by claims from lemuel s sandy bowers see bowers mansion joseph plato henry comstock james rogers and william knight in the spring of  after digging down to a depth of about ten feet they found a goldrich reddish quartz vein their discovery was actually part of the comstock lode the old red ledge– the four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the grosh brothers ophir discoveryedit in the spring of  two miners peter oriley and patrick mclaughlin finding all the paying ground already claimed went to the head of six mile canyon and began prospecting with a rocker on the slope of the mountain near a small stream fed from a neighboring spring they had poor results in the top dirt as there was no washed gravel and they were about to abandon their claim when they made the great discovery they sank a small deeper pit in which to collect water to use in their rockers in the bottom of this hole was a layer of rich black sand concentrate from the top of the hidden ophir bonanza henry t p comstock learned of the two men working on land that comstock allegedly had already claimed for grazing purposes unhappy with his current claim on gold hill comstock made threats and managed to work himself and his partner immanuel manny penrod into a deal that granted them interest on the claim on  june a trench they were digging exposed black manganese sand mixed with bluishgray quartz and gold two arrastras built by john d winters and ja osborn made them additional partners on  june comstock and penrod made an additional claim called the mexican but later called the spanish adjacent to the ophir claim–– with the blue stuff found in that trench silver mining in america as we know it was born in the rocker along with the gold was a large quantity of heavy blueblack material almost like putty which clogged the rocker and interfered with the washing out of the fine gold when assayed on  june however it was determined to be a rich sulfide of silver in fact the ore was three fourths silver to one fourth gold– the geographic accounts on the location of the comstock lode were muddled and inconsistent in one report the gold strike was on the eastern fork of walkers river and the

through surface diggings but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies unlike most silver ore deposits which occur in long thin veins those of the comstock lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick sometimes the ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated the weakness of the surrounding rock resulted in frequent and deadly caveins the excavations were carried to depths of more than  feet  m eventually after years of work the cavein problem was solved by the method of square set timbering invented by philip deidesheimer– a german mining engineer from san francisco who had been requested to survey the problem by the owners of the ophir mine previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings ribs capped by a third horizontal member to support the back roof creating a tunnel drift however the comstock ore bodies were not veins but sporadic pockets too large for this method instead as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side ribs front face or top back all at the same time thus the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice often these voids stopes would be refilled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete by this method of building up squares of framed timbers an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth deidesheimer was appointed to the ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea bullion mine virginia city c early in the history of comstock mining there were heavy flows of water to contend with this called for pumping machinery and apparatus and as greater depth was attained larger pumps were demanded all the inventive genius of the pacific coast was called into play and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found anywhere in the world initially the water was cold but the deeper workings cut into parts of the mountain where there were heavy flows of hot water mines dont always work in digging ore some parts of a mining operation could be deepening the existing shaft or exploring for more ore bodies this water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the geothermal pockets the hot water called for fans blowers and various kinds of ventilation apparatus as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the comstock mines diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use but were discarded for prospecting purposes being found unreliable several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed great improvements were also made in the hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work as the depth of the diggings increased the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical as their selfweight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength breaking weight after hemp rope iron chains began to become more common however fracture was quick at around half a millisecond in  wilhelm albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as albert rope in  andrew smith hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors his wire rope went on to be used in san franciscos famous cable cars and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the comstock lode another innovation were spring loaded cages the only way in and out of a shaft mine was in the cage cabled to the hoist all products men and supplies as well as recoverable ore travels up and down the shaft in a cage when the hemp rope or chains broke the cage would plummet uncontrolled to the bottom of the shaft killing its occupants or destroying its load cages were open to the front and rear with ibeams on both sides to support the floor the outside of the ibeams slid through wooden guides up and down the shaft top to bottom spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage one each attached to the ibeams through bolts and lifted in the center the outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous round head at the end notched with teeth molded into the rods the weight of the cage being lifted lifted the rods released the teeth and tightened the spring allowing the cage to move freely if the chain or cable broke the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood stopping the cage processingedit alta mine mill c  in  the americans knew nothing about silver mining john d winters jr and ja osborn built two arastras for the patio process at the ophir claim and gabriel maldonado a mexican of spanish descent began to smelt some of his rich ore in little adobe furnaces mexican fashion after purchasing penrods share of the mexican mine these methods proved to be too slow for the americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted the americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation some of the german miners who had been educated at the mining academy of freiberg were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores bagley introduced a variation of the freiberg process using the revolving barrel process of amalgamation and chloridizingroasting of ores after the stamp drycrushed while the barrel process was an improvement on the patio it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the comstock ores as pan amalgamation the comstock eventually developed the washoe process of using steamheated iron pans which reduced the weeks required by the patio process to hours– in the early days of pan processing of ores there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver mercury almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore they tried all manner of trash both mineral and vegetable including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea at that time untold millions in gold silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented there was much room for improvement improvements were made from time to time resulting in reductions in losses of metals but none of the apparatus in use on the comstock was perfect support infrastructureedit transportationedit carambo—caraja—sacramento—santa maria—diavolo the difficult trek by mule train from california  illustration from harpers before railroads were built all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from  to  horses or mules ore was hauled to the mills by these teams which also brought to the mines all the wood lumber and timber required teams also hauled over the sierra all the mining machinery all supplies required by both mines and mills and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons when the large reduction works of the ophir mining company were in peak operation lines of teams from one to three miles  km in length moved along the wagon roads and sometimes blocked virginia city streets for hours from  to  great quantities of goods were transported across the sierra to and from california on the backs of mules when the central pacific railroad line was completed to the truckee meadows this hauling was bidirectional from reno to virginia city via the geiger grade wagon road for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west– ground was broken on the virginia and truckee railroad on  feb  and by jan   the most difficult crookedest section from virginia city to carson city was completed rails were extended north across the washoe valley from carson city to reno where it connected with the central pacific– between virginia city and carson city at mound house the railroad also connected with the carson and colorado railroad the virginia city and gold hill water companyedit when silver was first discovered on the comstock the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of virginia city and gold hill nevada as population increased wells were dug for domestic needs and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply as the mills and hoisting works multiplied the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents now thousands in number in this need the virginia city and gold hill water company was formed being the first nonmining incorporation on the comstock lode water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted it became imperative to look toward the main range of the sierra nevada mountains where there was an inexhaustible supply between the sierra and the virginia ranges lay the washoe valley a great trough nearly  ft  m in depth hermann schussler a swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in san francisco was brought to the comstock to plan and design the new works surveys were made in  the first sections of pipe laid june   and the last on july  the same year the initial pipe was made of wrought iron a total length of over  mi  km with an interior diameter of  in  mm and a capacity of  gallons per hour the pipe traversed the washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon and at the lowest point having a pressure of  ft  m of water– or  pounds per square inch the inlet being  ft  m above the outlet the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure water was brought to the inlet in the sierra nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of  mi  km to virginia city the pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together each section fastened with three rows of rivets lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section the first flow of water reached gold hill and virginia city on august   with great fanfare this accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world having superseded the water system at cherokee flat also designed by schussler the water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in  and a third pipe in  these pipes of lap welded joints delivered more water there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply sutro tunneledit sutro tunnel ca  main article sutro tunnel while there was a scarcity of water on the surface there was an excess of water underground in all the mines floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped intrusion of scaldinghot water into the mines was a large problem and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased to overcome these troubles adolph sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the comstock lode from the lowest possible point a survey was made by schussler and work commenced in october  the sutro tunnel was completed from the valley near dayton through nearly four miles  feet of solid rock to meet the comstock mines approximately  ft  m beneath the surface two drain laterals were dug the north lateral was  feet long while the south lateral was  feet long the tunnel was  ft  m wide and  ft  m high inside of the timbering drain flumes were sunk in the floor and over these were two tracks for horse carts it required eight and a half years to reach the lode the tunnel drained up to  gallons daily– the tunnel provided drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravityassisted ore removal however by the time the tunnel reached the comstock area mines most of the ore above  ft  m had already been removed and the lower workings were  ft  m deeper still although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served the ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by compressed air for the use of pneumatic drills the tunnel connected with the savage claim on  july  all of the gold hill mines stopped pumping water by march  and allowed water to rise to the level of the tunnel the combination shaft ceased pumping below the tunnel on  oct  yellow jacket mine fireedit on the morning of april   a fire spread at the  foot level in the yellow jacket mine firefighters entered the mine but the smoke and flames pushed them back as the fire burned wood timbers collapsed and poisonous gases expanded into the adjacent kentucky and crown point mines the fires persisted and mine sections were sealed off and remained hot for several years at least thirty five miners died and some bodies were never retrieved the yellow jacket mine fire was the worst mining accident in nevada history up to that time later yearsedit remains of the combination shaft  the combination shaft located near virginia city began in  when the mine owners combined their efforts to sink a shaft to explore the comstock lode at a greater depth the combination was the deepest shaft ever sunk on the comstock reaching a depth of  feet it was used until  the total product of ore extracted and milled in the comstock district  to june   was  tons  pounds peak production from the comstock occurred in  with the mines producing over  of gold and  of silver that year about  and  today the deepest depth reached in  was by the ophirmexican winze at  ft  m below the surface production from comstock mines from  to  was  with a net profit of  most of that in the s the bonanza period was at an end by – deep underground exploration and mining continued sporadically until  when the last of the pumps was shut off allowing the mines to flood up to the sutro tunnel level approximately  feet beneath virginia city all mining from  to present has taken place above the sutro tunnel level meanwhile through the early years of the th century ownership of mineral rights along the length of the comstock lode were consolidated primarily into a handful of companies most of them privately held this was a departure from the late s when upwards of  mining companies operated on the comstock with at least  of them publicly traded comstocks silver mines were criticized for the way that their share prices were manipulated on the san francisco stock exchanges and for the way that insiders skimmed the profits to the detriment of the common shareholders insiders used rumors or assessments to drive share prices down buy up the cheap shares then spread rumors of large new silver finds to increase prices once more so that they could sell their shares at a profit mining company managers also issued contracts to themselves for timber and water ore from the mines was commonly processed by ore mills owned by the company insiders who were accused of keeping part of the silver they extracted for themselves and refusing to make an accounting in  the united comstock mines company was organized by prominent comstock mining engineers roy hardy and alex wise with financial backing by new york businessman harry payne whitney united comstock consolidated ownership of the entire gold hill section of the comstock lode representing  feet of strike length and a mill site in american flat this enterprise constructed the  tonperday capacity american flat cyanide mill the largest in the world at the time and drove a tunnel  feet from the mill under gold hill the economics of this project were tenuous and with a drop in silver prices it closed in – in  the federal government raised the price of gold from  to  per ounce which vastly improved the economics of projects on the comstock several companies embarked on substantial projects including arizona comstock company in  began underground mining through the hale  norcross tunnel followed quickly by a surface mine known as the loring cut

be relatively ineffective at recovering comstock gold and silver and this operation shut down by – dayton consolidated the dayton consolidated mill in silver city processed ore from its own mine as well as operating as a custom mill for a number of mines in the area con chollar the con chollar mining company built a  tonperday flotation mill near the south end of gold hill to reprocess tailings

crown point claim in gold hill the sutro tunnel coalition built a  tonperday cyanide mill to process both underground and surface mined ore in  the mill and mine development was accomplished with a

jacket claims until it was shut down by war production board order l in – exploration and production of varying scales and in varying locations have been undertaken on the comstock lode in every decade since its discovery there was a particular flurry of activity including major surface mining operations by the houston oil and mineral company followed by united mining in the late s and early

to california the camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of – when about  men worked part of the year along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers long toms and sluices after nine years the gold canyon placers were producing less and many miners left for the mono lake placers the gold from gold canyon came from quartz veins toward the head of the vein in the vicinity of where silver city and gold hill now stand as the miners worked their way up the stream they founded the town of johntown on a plateau in  the johntown miners found gold in sixmile canyon which is about five miles  km north of gold canyon the heads of both these canyons form the north and south ends of what is now known as the comstock lode defined by the ophir discovery and the gold hill

accompanied by an associate richard maurice bucke set out on a trek to california with samples and maps of his claim henry comstock was left in their stead to care for the grosh cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery grosh and bucke never made it to california getting lost and suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the sierra nevada mountains the two suffered from frostbite while crossing the sierras and at the hands of a minorsurgeon lost limbs through amputation a lastditch effort to save the lives of the pair allen grosh died on december   rm bucke lived but upon his recovery returned to his home in canada when henry t p comstock learned of the death of the grosh brothers he claimed the cabin and the lands as his own he also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man what he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein he continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the grosh brothers find was still unclaimed upon learning of a strike on gold hill which uncovered some bluish rock silver ore comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area gold hill discoveryedit four miners discovered the gold hill outcropping at the head of gold canyon making placer claims after finding traces of gold on  jan  they were james finney old virginny a contemporary rumor was that he changed his name from fennimore to finney after murdering a man john bishop big french john aleck henderson and jack yount these claims were followed by claims from lemuel s sandy bowers see bowers mansion joseph plato henry comstock james rogers and william knight in the spring of  after digging down to a depth of about ten feet they found a goldrich reddish quartz vein their discovery was actually part of the comstock lode the old red ledge– the four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the grosh brothers ophir discoveryedit in the spring of  two miners peter oriley and patrick mclaughlin finding all the paying ground already claimed went to the head of six mile canyon and began prospecting with a rocker on the slope of the mountain near a small stream fed from a neighboring spring they had poor results in the top dirt as there was no washed gravel and they were about to abandon their claim when they made the great discovery they sank a small deeper pit in which to collect water to use in their rockers in the bottom of this hole was a layer of rich black sand concentrate from the top of the hidden ophir bonanza henry t p comstock learned of the two men working on land that comstock allegedly had already claimed for grazing purposes unhappy with his current claim on gold hill comstock made threats and managed to work himself and his partner immanuel manny penrod into a deal that granted them interest on the claim on  june a trench they were digging exposed black manganese sand mixed with bluishgray quartz and gold two arrastras built by john d winters and ja osborn made them additional partners on  june comstock and penrod made an additional claim called the mexican but later called the spanish adjacent to the ophir claim–– with the blue stuff found in that trench silver mining in america as we know it was born in the rocker along with the gold was a large quantity of heavy blueblack material almost like putty which clogged the rocker and interfered with the washing out of the fine gold when assayed on  june however it was determined to be a rich sulfide of silver in fact the ore was three fourths silver to one fourth gold– the geographic accounts on the location of the

years of extensive work by thousands of miners and the investments of millions of dollars—which none of them had weighing the chances of gain and loss as they stood in  the prospectors had no cause to reproach themselves with lack of foresight patrick mclaughlin sold his  interest in the ophir claim for  to george hearst mclaughlin soon lost the money he then worked as a cook at the green mine in

revolver innovations and developmentedit miningedit bonner shaft gould  curry mine  the ore was first extracted through surface diggings but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies unlike most silver ore deposits which occur in long thin veins those of the comstock lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick sometimes the ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated the weakness of the surrounding rock resulted in frequent and deadly caveins the excavations were carried to depths of more than  feet  m eventually after years of work the cavein problem was solved by the method of square set timbering invented by philip deidesheimer– a german mining engineer from san francisco who had been requested to survey the problem by the owners of the ophir mine previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings ribs capped by a third horizontal member to support the back roof creating a tunnel drift however the comstock ore bodies were not veins but sporadic pockets too large for this method instead as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side ribs front face or top back all at the same time thus the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice often these voids stopes would be refilled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete by this method of building up squares of framed timbers an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth deidesheimer was appointed to the ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea bullion mine virginia city c early in the history of comstock mining there were heavy flows of water to contend with this called for pumping machinery and apparatus and as greater depth was attained larger pumps were demanded all the inventive genius of the pacific coast was called into play and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found anywhere in the world initially the water was cold but the deeper workings cut into parts of the mountain where there were heavy flows of hot water mines dont always work in digging ore some parts of a mining operation could be deepening the existing shaft or exploring for more ore bodies this water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the geothermal pockets the hot water called for fans blowers and various kinds of ventilation apparatus as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the comstock mines diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use but were discarded for prospecting purposes being found unreliable several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed great improvements were also made in the hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work as the depth of the diggings increased the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical as their selfweight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength breaking weight after hemp rope iron chains began to become more common however fracture was quick at around half a millisecond in  wilhelm albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as albert rope in  andrew smith hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors his wire rope went on to be used in san franciscos famous cable cars and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the comstock lode another innovation were spring loaded cages the only way in and out of a shaft mine was in the cage cabled to the hoist all products men and supplies as well as recoverable ore travels up and down the shaft in a cage when the hemp rope or chains broke the cage would plummet uncontrolled to the bottom of the shaft killing its occupants or destroying its load cages were open to the front and rear with ibeams on both sides to support the floor the outside of the ibeams slid through wooden guides up and down the shaft top to bottom spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage one each attached to the ibeams through bolts and lifted in the center the outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous round head at the end notched with teeth molded into the rods the weight of the cage being lifted lifted the rods released the teeth and tightened the spring allowing the cage to move freely if the chain or cable broke the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood stopping the cage processingedit alta mine mill c  in  the americans knew nothing about silver mining john d winters jr and ja osborn built two arastras for the patio process at the ophir claim and gabriel maldonado a mexican of spanish descent began to smelt some of his rich ore in little adobe furnaces mexican fashion after purchasing penrods share of the mexican mine these methods proved to be too slow for the americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted the americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation some of the german miners who had been educated at the mining academy of freiberg were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores bagley introduced a variation of the freiberg process using the revolving barrel process of amalgamation and chloridizingroasting of ores after the stamp drycrushed while the barrel process was an improvement on the patio it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the comstock ores as pan amalgamation the comstock eventually developed the washoe process of using steamheated iron pans which reduced the weeks required by the patio process to hours– in the early days of pan processing of ores there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver mercury almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore they tried all manner of trash both mineral and vegetable including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea at that time untold millions in gold silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented there was much room for improvement improvements were made from time to time resulting in reductions in losses of metals but none of the apparatus in use on the comstock was perfect support infrastructureedit transportationedit carambo—caraja—sacramento—santa maria—diavolo the difficult trek by mule train from california  illustration from harpers before railroads were built all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from  to  horses or mules ore was hauled to the mills by these teams which also brought to the mines all the wood lumber and timber required teams also hauled over the sierra all the mining machinery all supplies required by both mines and mills and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons when the large reduction works of the ophir mining company were in peak operation lines of teams from one to three miles  km in length moved along the wagon roads and sometimes blocked virginia city streets for hours from  to  great quantities of goods were transported across the sierra to and from california on the backs of mules when the central pacific railroad line was completed to the truckee meadows this hauling was bidirectional from reno to virginia city via the geiger grade wagon road for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west– ground was broken on the virginia and truckee railroad on  feb  and by jan   the most difficult crookedest section from virginia city to carson city was completed rails were extended north across the washoe valley from carson city to reno where it connected with the central pacific– between virginia city and carson city at mound house the railroad also connected with the carson and colorado railroad the virginia city and gold hill water companyedit when silver was first discovered on the comstock the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of virginia city and gold hill nevada as population increased wells were dug for domestic needs and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply as the mills and hoisting works multiplied the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents now thousands in number in this need the virginia city and gold hill water company was formed being the first nonmining incorporation on the comstock lode water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted it became imperative to look toward the main range of the sierra nevada mountains where there was an inexhaustible supply between the sierra and the virginia ranges lay the washoe valley a great trough nearly  ft  m in depth hermann schussler a swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in san francisco was brought to the comstock to plan and design the new works surveys were made in  the first sections of pipe laid june   and the last on july  the same year the initial pipe was made of wrought iron a total length of over  mi  km with an interior diameter of  in  mm and a capacity of  gallons per hour the pipe traversed the washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon and at the lowest point having a pressure of  ft  m of water– or  pounds per square inch the inlet being  ft  m above the outlet the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure water was brought to the inlet in the sierra nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of  mi  km to virginia city the pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together each section fastened with three rows of rivets lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section the first flow of water reached gold hill and virginia city on august   with great fanfare this accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world having superseded the water system at cherokee flat also designed by schussler the water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in  and a third pipe in  these pipes of lap welded joints delivered more water there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply sutro tunneledit sutro tunnel ca  main article sutro tunnel while there was a scarcity of water on the surface there was an excess of water underground in all the mines floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped intrusion of scaldinghot water into the mines was a large problem and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased to overcome these troubles adolph sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the comstock lode from the lowest possible point a survey was made by schussler and work commenced in october  the sutro tunnel was completed from the valley near dayton through nearly four miles  feet of solid rock to meet the comstock mines approximately  ft  m beneath the surface two drain laterals were dug the north lateral was  feet long while the south lateral was  feet long the tunnel was  ft  m wide and  ft  m high inside of the timbering drain flumes were sunk in the floor and over these were two tracks for horse carts it required eight and a half years to reach the lode the tunnel drained up to  gallons daily– the tunnel provided drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravityassisted ore removal however by the time the tunnel reached the comstock area mines most of the ore above  ft  m had already been removed and the lower workings were  ft  m deeper still although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served the ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by compressed air for the use of pneumatic drills the tunnel connected with the savage claim on  july  all of the gold hill mines stopped pumping water by march  and allowed water to rise to the level of the tunnel the combination shaft ceased pumping below the tunnel on  oct  yellow jacket mine fireedit on the morning of april   a fire spread at the  foot level in the yellow jacket mine firefighters entered the mine but the smoke and flames pushed them back as the fire burned wood timbers collapsed and poisonous gases expanded into the adjacent kentucky and crown point mines the fires persisted and mine sections were sealed off and remained hot for several years at least thirty five miners died and some bodies were never retrieved the yellow jacket mine fire was the worst mining accident in nevada history up to that time later yearsedit remains of the combination shaft  the combination shaft located near virginia city began in  when the mine owners combined their efforts to sink a shaft to explore the comstock lode at a greater depth the combination was the deepest shaft ever sunk on the comstock reaching a depth of  feet it was used until  the total product of ore extracted and milled in the comstock district  to june   was  tons  pounds peak production from the comstock occurred in  with the mines producing over  of gold and  of silver that year about

period was at an end by – deep underground exploration and mining continued sporadically until  when the last of the pumps was shut off allowing the mines to flood up to the sutro tunnel level approximately  feet beneath virginia city all mining from  to present has taken place above the sutro tunnel level meanwhile through the early years of the th century ownership of mineral rights along the length of the comstock lode were consolidated primarily into a handful of companies most of them privately held this was a departure from the late s when upwards of  mining companies operated on the comstock with at least  of them publicly traded comstocks silver mines were criticized for the way that their share prices were manipulated on the san francisco stock exchanges and for the way that insiders skimmed the profits to the detriment of the common shareholders insiders used rumors or assessments to drive share prices down buy up the cheap shares then spread rumors of large new silver finds to increase prices once more so that they could sell their shares at a profit mining company managers also issued contracts to themselves for timber and water ore from the mines was commonly processed by ore mills owned by the company insiders who were accused of keeping part of the silver they extracted for themselves and refusing to make an accounting in  the united comstock

passable as they anticipated taking out more gold on reaching california orr named the gulch gold cañón other emigrants followed camped in the canyon and went to work at mining however when the supply of water in the canyon gave out toward the end of summer they continued across the mountains to california the camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of – when about  men worked part of the year along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers long toms and sluices after nine years the gold canyon placers were producing less and many miners left for the mono lake placers the gold from gold canyon came from quartz veins toward the head of the vein in the vicinity of where silver city and gold hill now stand as the miners worked their way up the stream they founded the town of johntown on a plateau in  the johntown miners found gold in sixmile canyon which is about five miles  km north of gold canyon the heads of both these canyons form the north and south ends of what

henry comstock was left in their stead to care for the grosh cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery grosh and bucke never made it to california getting lost and suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the sierra nevada mountains the two suffered from frostbite while crossing the sierras and at the hands of a minorsurgeon lost limbs through amputation a lastditch effort to save the lives of the pair allen grosh died on december   rm bucke lived but upon his recovery returned to his home in canada when henry t p comstock learned of the death of the grosh brothers he claimed the cabin and the lands as his own he also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man what he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein he continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the grosh brothers find was still unclaimed upon learning of a strike on gold hill which uncovered some bluish rock silver ore comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area gold hill discoveryedit four miners discovered the gold hill outcropping at the head of gold canyon making placer claims after finding traces of gold on  jan  they were james finney old virginny a contemporary rumor was that he changed his name from fennimore to finney after murdering a man john bishop big french john aleck henderson and jack yount these claims were followed by claims from lemuel s sandy bowers see bowers mansion joseph plato henry comstock james rogers and william knight in the spring of  after digging down to a depth of about ten feet they found a goldrich reddish quartz vein their discovery was actually part of the comstock lode the old red ledge– the four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the grosh brothers ophir discoveryedit in the spring of  two miners peter oriley and patrick mclaughlin finding all the paying ground already claimed went to the head of six mile canyon and began prospecting with a rocker on the slope of the mountain near a small stream fed from a neighboring spring they had poor results in the top dirt as there was no washed gravel and they were about to abandon their claim when they made the great discovery they sank a small deeper pit in which to collect water to use in their rockers in the bottom of this hole was a layer of rich black sand concentrate from the top of the hidden ophir bonanza henry t p comstock learned of the two men working on land that comstock allegedly had already claimed for grazing purposes unhappy with his current claim on gold hill comstock made threats and managed to work himself and his partner immanuel manny penrod into a deal that granted them interest on the claim on  june a trench they were digging exposed black manganese sand mixed with bluishgray quartz and gold two arrastras built by john d winters and ja osborn made them additional partners on  june comstock and penrod made an additional claim called the mexican but later called the spanish adjacent to the ophir claim–– with the blue stuff found in that trench silver mining in america as we know it was born in the rocker along with the gold was a large quantity of heavy blueblack material almost like putty which clogged the rocker and interfered with the washing out of the fine gold when assayed on  june however it was determined to be a rich sulfide of silver in fact the ore was three fourths

thoroughly the size of the strike and its potential value would take many years of extensive work by thousands of miners and the investments of millions of dollars—which none of them had weighing the chances of gain and loss as they stood in  the prospectors had no cause to reproach themselves with lack of foresight patrick mclaughlin sold his  interest in the ophir claim for  to george hearst

through surface diggings but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies unlike most silver ore deposits which occur in long thin veins those of the comstock lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick sometimes the ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated the weakness of the surrounding rock resulted in frequent and deadly caveins the excavations were carried to depths of more than  feet  m eventually after years of work the cavein problem was solved by the method of square set timbering invented by philip deidesheimer– a german mining engineer from san francisco who had been requested to survey the problem by the owners of the ophir mine previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings ribs capped by a third horizontal member to support the back roof creating a tunnel drift however the comstock ore bodies were not veins but sporadic pockets too large for this method instead as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side ribs front face or top back all at the same time thus the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice often these voids stopes would be refilled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete by this method of building up squares of framed timbers an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth deidesheimer was appointed to the ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea bullion mine virginia city c early in the history of comstock mining there were heavy flows of water to contend with this called for pumping machinery and apparatus and as greater depth was attained larger pumps were demanded all the inventive genius of the pacific coast was called into play and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found anywhere in the world initially the water was cold but the deeper workings cut into parts of the mountain where there were heavy flows of hot water mines dont always work in digging ore some parts of a mining operation could be deepening the existing shaft or exploring for more ore bodies this water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the geothermal pockets the hot water called for fans blowers and various kinds of ventilation apparatus as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the comstock mines diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use but were discarded for prospecting purposes being found unreliable several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed great improvements were also made in the hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work as the depth of the diggings increased the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical as their selfweight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength breaking weight after hemp rope iron chains began to become more common however fracture was quick at around half a millisecond in  wilhelm albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as albert rope in  andrew smith hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors his wire rope went on to be used in san franciscos famous cable cars and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the comstock lode another innovation were spring loaded cages the only way in and out of a shaft mine was in the cage cabled to the hoist all products men and supplies as well as recoverable ore travels up and down the shaft in a cage when the hemp rope or chains broke the cage would plummet uncontrolled to the bottom of the shaft killing its occupants or destroying its load cages were open to the front and rear with ibeams on both sides to support the floor the outside of the ibeams slid through wooden guides up and down the shaft top to bottom spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage one each attached to the ibeams through bolts and lifted in the center the outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous round head at the end notched with teeth molded into the rods the weight of the cage being lifted lifted the rods released the teeth and tightened the spring allowing the cage to move freely if the chain or cable broke the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood stopping the cage processingedit alta mine mill c  in  the americans knew nothing about silver mining john d winters jr and ja osborn built two arastras for the patio process at the ophir claim and gabriel maldonado a mexican of spanish descent began to smelt some of his rich ore in little adobe furnaces mexican fashion after purchasing penrods share of the mexican mine these methods proved to be too slow for the americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted the americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation some of the german miners who had been educated at the mining academy of freiberg were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores bagley introduced a variation of the freiberg process using the revolving barrel process of amalgamation and chloridizingroasting of ores after the stamp drycrushed while the barrel process was an improvement on the patio it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the comstock ores as pan amalgamation the comstock eventually developed the washoe process of using steamheated iron pans which reduced the weeks required by the patio process to hours– in the early days of pan processing of ores there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver mercury almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore they tried all manner of trash both mineral and vegetable including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea at that time untold millions in gold silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented there was much room for improvement improvements were made from time to time resulting in reductions in losses of metals but none of the apparatus in use on the comstock was perfect support infrastructureedit transportationedit carambo—caraja—sacramento—santa maria—diavolo the difficult trek by mule train from california  illustration from harpers before railroads were built all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from  to  horses or mules ore was hauled to the mills by these teams which also brought to the mines all the wood lumber and timber required teams also hauled over the sierra all the mining machinery all supplies required by both mines and mills and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons when the large reduction works of the ophir mining company were in peak operation lines of teams from one to three miles  km in length moved along the wagon roads and sometimes blocked virginia city streets for hours from  to  great quantities of goods were transported across the sierra to and from california on the backs of mules when the central pacific railroad line was completed to the truckee meadows this hauling was bidirectional from reno to virginia city via the geiger grade wagon road for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west– ground was broken on the virginia and truckee railroad on  feb  and by jan   the most difficult crookedest section from virginia city to carson city was completed rails were extended north across the washoe valley from carson city to reno where it connected with the central pacific– between virginia city and carson city at mound house the railroad also connected with the carson and colorado railroad the virginia city and gold hill water companyedit when silver was first discovered on the comstock the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of virginia city and gold hill nevada as population increased wells were dug for domestic needs and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply as the mills and hoisting works multiplied the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents now thousands in number in this need the virginia city and gold hill water company was formed being the first nonmining incorporation on the comstock lode water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted it became imperative to look toward the main range of the sierra nevada mountains where there was an inexhaustible supply between the sierra and the virginia ranges lay the washoe valley a great trough nearly  ft  m in depth hermann schussler a swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in san francisco was brought to the comstock to plan and design the new works surveys were made in  the first sections of pipe laid june   and the last on july  the same year the initial pipe was made of wrought iron a total length of over  mi  km with an interior diameter of  in  mm and a capacity of  gallons per hour the pipe traversed the washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon and at the lowest point having a pressure of  ft  m of water– or  pounds per square inch the inlet being  ft  m above the outlet the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure water was brought to the inlet in the sierra nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of  mi  km to virginia city the pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together each section fastened with three rows of rivets lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section the first flow of water reached gold hill and virginia city on august   with great fanfare this accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world having superseded the water system at cherokee flat also designed by schussler the water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in  and a third pipe in  these pipes of lap welded joints delivered more water there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply sutro tunneledit sutro tunnel ca  main article sutro tunnel while there was a scarcity of water on the surface there was an excess of water underground in all the mines floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped intrusion of scaldinghot water into the mines was a large problem and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased to overcome these troubles adolph sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the comstock lode from the lowest possible point a survey was made by schussler and work commenced in october  the sutro tunnel was completed from the valley near dayton through nearly four miles  feet of solid rock to meet the comstock mines approximately  ft  m beneath the surface two drain laterals were dug the north lateral was  feet long while the south lateral was  feet long the tunnel was  ft  m wide and  ft  m high inside of the timbering drain flumes were sunk in the floor and over these were two tracks for horse carts it required eight and a half years to reach the lode the tunnel drained up to  gallons daily– the tunnel provided drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravityassisted ore removal however by the time the tunnel reached the comstock area mines most of the ore above  ft  m had already been removed and the lower workings were  ft  m deeper still although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served the ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by compressed air for the use of pneumatic drills the tunnel connected with the savage claim on  july  all of the gold hill mines stopped pumping water by march  and allowed water to rise to the level of the tunnel the combination shaft ceased pumping below the tunnel on  oct  yellow jacket mine fireedit on the morning of april   a fire spread at the  foot level in the yellow jacket mine firefighters entered the mine but the smoke and flames pushed them back as the fire burned wood timbers collapsed and poisonous gases expanded into the adjacent kentucky and crown point mines the fires persisted and mine sections were sealed off and remained hot for several years at least thirty five miners died and some bodies were never retrieved the yellow jacket mine fire was the worst mining accident in nevada history up to that time later yearsedit remains of the combination shaft  the combination shaft located near virginia city began in  when the mine owners combined their efforts to sink a shaft to explore the comstock lode at a greater depth the combination was the deepest shaft ever sunk on the comstock reaching a depth of  feet it was used until  the total product of ore extracted and milled in the comstock district  to june   was  tons  pounds peak production from the comstock occurred in  with the mines producing over  of gold and  of silver that year about  and  today the deepest depth reached in  was by the ophirmexican winze at  ft  m below the surface production from comstock mines from  to  was  with a net profit of  most of that in the s the bonanza period was at an end by – deep underground exploration and mining continued sporadically until  when the last of the pumps was shut off allowing the mines to flood up to the sutro tunnel level approximately  feet beneath virginia city all mining from  to present has taken place above the sutro tunnel level meanwhile through the early years of the th century ownership of mineral rights along the length of the comstock lode were consolidated primarily into a handful of companies most of them privately held this was a departure from the late s when upwards of  mining companies operated on the comstock with at least  of them publicly traded comstocks silver mines were criticized for the way that their share prices were manipulated on the san francisco stock exchanges and for the way that insiders skimmed the profits to the detriment of the common shareholders insiders used rumors or assessments to drive share prices down buy up the cheap shares then spread rumors of large new silver finds to increase prices once more so that they could sell their shares at a profit mining company managers also issued contracts to themselves for timber and water ore from the mines was commonly processed by ore mills owned by the company insiders who were accused of keeping part of the silver they extracted for themselves and refusing to make an accounting in  the united comstock mines company was organized by prominent comstock mining engineers roy hardy and alex wise with financial backing by new york businessman harry payne whitney united comstock consolidated ownership of the entire gold hill section of the comstock lode representing  feet of strike length and a mill site in american flat this enterprise constructed the  tonperday capacity american flat cyanide mill the largest in the world at the time and drove a tunnel  feet from the mill under gold hill the economics of this project were tenuous and with a drop in silver prices it closed in – in  the federal government raised the price of gold from  to  per ounce which vastly improved the economics of projects on the comstock several companies embarked on substantial projects including arizona comstock company in  began underground mining through the hale  norcross tunnel followed quickly by a surface mine known as the loring cut

be relatively ineffective at recovering comstock gold and silver and this operation shut down by – dayton consolidated the dayton consolidated mill in silver city processed ore from its own mine as well as operating as a custom mill for a number of mines in the area con chollar the con chollar mining company built a  tonperday flotation mill near the south end of gold hill to reprocess tailings

crown point claim in gold hill the sutro tunnel coalition built a  tonperday cyanide mill to process both underground and surface mined ore in  the mill and mine development was accomplished with a

jacket claims until it was shut down by war production board order l in – exploration and production of varying scales and in varying locations have been undertaken on the comstock lode in every decade since its discovery there was a particular flurry of activity including major surface mining operations by the houston oil and mineral company followed by united mining in the late s and early

to california the camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of – when about  men worked part of the year along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers long toms and sluices after nine years the gold canyon placers were producing less and many miners left for the mono lake placers the gold from gold canyon came from quartz veins toward the head of the vein in the vicinity of where silver city and gold hill now stand as the miners worked their way up the stream they founded the town of johntown on a plateau in  the johntown miners found gold in sixmile canyon which is about five miles  km north of gold canyon the heads of both these canyons form the north and south ends of what is now known as the comstock lode defined by the ophir discovery and the gold hill

accompanied by an associate richard maurice bucke set out on a trek to california with samples and maps of his claim henry comstock was left in their stead to care for the grosh cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery grosh and bucke never made it to california getting lost and suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the sierra nevada mountains the two suffered from frostbite while crossing the sierras and at the hands of a minorsurgeon lost limbs through amputation a lastditch effort to save the lives of the pair allen grosh died on december   rm bucke lived but upon his recovery returned to his home in canada when henry t p comstock learned of the death of the grosh brothers he claimed the cabin and the lands as his own he also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man what he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein he continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the grosh brothers find was still unclaimed upon learning of a strike on gold hill which uncovered some bluish rock silver ore comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area gold hill discoveryedit four miners discovered the gold hill outcropping at the head of gold canyon making placer claims after finding traces of gold on  jan  they were james finney old virginny a contemporary rumor was that he changed his name from fennimore to finney after murdering a man john bishop big french john aleck henderson and jack yount these claims were followed by claims from lemuel s sandy bowers see bowers mansion joseph plato henry comstock james rogers and william knight in the spring of  after digging down to a depth of about ten feet they found a goldrich reddish quartz vein their discovery was actually part of the comstock lode the old red ledge– the four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the grosh brothers ophir discoveryedit in the spring of  two miners peter oriley and patrick mclaughlin finding all the paying ground already claimed went to the head of six mile canyon and began prospecting with a rocker on the slope of the mountain near a small stream fed from a neighboring spring they had poor results in the top dirt as there was no washed gravel and they were about to abandon their claim when they made the great discovery they sank a small deeper pit in which to collect water to use in their rockers in the bottom of this hole was a layer of rich black sand concentrate from the top of the hidden ophir bonanza henry t p comstock learned of the two men working on land that comstock allegedly had already claimed for grazing purposes unhappy with his current claim on gold hill comstock made threats and managed to work himself and his partner immanuel manny penrod into a deal that granted them interest on the claim on  june a trench they were digging exposed black manganese sand mixed with bluishgray quartz and gold two arrastras built by john d winters and ja osborn made them additional partners on  june comstock and penrod made an additional claim called the mexican but later called the spanish adjacent to the ophir claim–– with the blue stuff found in that trench silver mining in america as we know it was born in the rocker along with the gold was a large quantity of heavy blueblack material almost like putty which clogged the rocker and interfered with the washing out of the fine gold when assayed on  june however it was determined to be a rich sulfide of silver in fact the ore was three fourths silver to one fourth gold– the geographic accounts on the location of the

strike like nearly all other gold strikes all of them knew they did not have the money or expertise to investigate the strike thoroughly the size of the strike and its potential value would take many years of extensive work by thousands of miners and the investments of millions of dollars—which none of them had weighing the chances of gain and loss as they stood in  the prospectors had no cause to

revolver innovations and developmentedit miningedit bonner shaft gould  curry mine  the ore was first extracted through surface diggings but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies unlike most silver ore deposits which occur in long thin veins those of the comstock lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick sometimes the ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated the weakness of the surrounding rock resulted in frequent and deadly caveins the excavations were carried to depths of more than  feet  m eventually after years of work the cavein problem was solved by the method of square set timbering invented by philip deidesheimer– a german mining engineer from san francisco who had been requested to survey the problem by the owners of the ophir mine previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings ribs capped by a third horizontal member to support the back roof creating a tunnel drift however the comstock ore bodies were not veins but sporadic pockets too large for this method instead as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side ribs front face or top back all at the same time thus the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice often these voids stopes would be refilled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete by this method of building up squares of framed timbers an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth deidesheimer was appointed to the ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea bullion mine virginia city c early in the history of comstock mining there were heavy flows of water to contend with this called for pumping machinery and apparatus and as greater depth was attained larger pumps were demanded all the inventive genius of the pacific coast was called into play and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found anywhere in the world initially the water was cold but the deeper workings cut into parts of the mountain where there were heavy flows of hot water mines dont always work in digging ore some parts of a mining operation could be deepening the existing shaft or exploring for more ore bodies this water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the geothermal pockets the hot water called for fans blowers and various kinds of ventilation apparatus as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the comstock mines diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use but were discarded for prospecting purposes being found unreliable several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed great improvements were also made in the hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work as the depth of the diggings increased the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical as their selfweight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength breaking weight after hemp rope iron chains began to become more common however fracture was quick at around half a millisecond in  wilhelm albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as albert rope in  andrew smith hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors his wire rope went on to be used in san franciscos famous cable cars and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the comstock lode another innovation were spring loaded cages the only way in and out of a shaft mine was in the cage cabled to the hoist all products men and supplies as well as recoverable ore travels up and down the shaft in a cage when the hemp rope or chains broke the cage would plummet uncontrolled to the bottom of the shaft killing its occupants or destroying its load cages were open to the front and rear with ibeams on both sides to support the floor the outside of the ibeams slid through wooden guides up and down the shaft top to bottom spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage one each attached to the ibeams through bolts and lifted in the center the outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous round head at the end notched with teeth molded into the rods the weight of the cage being lifted lifted the rods released the teeth and tightened the spring allowing the cage to move freely if the chain or cable broke the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood stopping the cage processingedit alta mine mill c  in  the americans knew nothing about silver mining john d winters jr and ja osborn built two arastras for the patio process at the ophir claim and gabriel maldonado a mexican of spanish descent began to smelt some of his rich ore in little adobe furnaces mexican fashion after purchasing penrods share of the mexican mine these methods proved to be too slow for the americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted the americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation some of the german miners who had been educated at the mining academy of freiberg were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores bagley introduced a variation of the freiberg process using the revolving barrel process of amalgamation and chloridizingroasting of ores after the stamp drycrushed while the barrel process was an improvement on the patio it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the comstock ores as pan amalgamation the comstock eventually developed the washoe process of using steamheated iron pans which reduced the weeks required by the patio process to hours– in the early days of pan processing of ores there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver mercury almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore they tried all manner of trash both mineral and vegetable including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea at that time untold millions in gold silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented there was much room for improvement improvements were made from time to time resulting in reductions in losses of metals but none of the apparatus in use on the comstock was perfect support infrastructureedit transportationedit carambo—caraja—sacramento—santa maria—diavolo the difficult trek by mule train from california  illustration from harpers before railroads were built all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from  to  horses or mules ore was hauled to the mills by these teams which also brought to the mines all the wood lumber and timber required teams also hauled over the sierra all the mining machinery all supplies required by both mines and mills and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons when the large reduction works of the ophir mining company were in peak operation lines of teams from one to three miles  km in length moved along the wagon roads and sometimes blocked virginia city streets for hours from  to  great quantities of goods were transported across the sierra to and from california on the backs of mules when the central pacific railroad line was completed to the truckee meadows this hauling was bidirectional from reno to virginia city via the geiger grade wagon road for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west– ground was broken on the virginia and truckee railroad on  feb  and by jan   the most difficult crookedest section from virginia city to carson city was completed rails were extended north across the washoe valley from carson city to reno where it connected with the central pacific– between virginia city and carson city at mound house the railroad also connected with the carson and colorado railroad the virginia city and gold hill water companyedit when silver was first discovered on the comstock the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of virginia city and gold hill nevada as population increased wells were dug for domestic needs and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply as the mills and hoisting works multiplied the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents now thousands in number in this need the virginia city and gold hill water company was formed being the first nonmining incorporation on the comstock lode water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted it became imperative to look toward the main range of the sierra nevada mountains where there was an inexhaustible supply between the sierra and the virginia ranges lay the washoe valley a great trough nearly  ft  m in depth hermann schussler a swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in san francisco was brought to the comstock to plan and design the new works surveys were made in  the first sections of pipe laid june   and the last on july  the same year the initial pipe was made of wrought iron a total length of over  mi  km with an interior diameter of  in  mm and a capacity of  gallons per hour the pipe traversed the washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon and at the lowest point having a pressure of  ft  m of water– or  pounds per square inch the inlet being  ft  m above the outlet the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure water was brought to the inlet in the sierra nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of  mi  km to virginia city the pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together each section fastened with three rows of rivets lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section the first flow of water reached gold hill and virginia city on august   with great fanfare this accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world having superseded the water system at cherokee flat also designed by schussler the water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in  and a third pipe in  these pipes of lap welded joints delivered more water there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply sutro tunneledit sutro tunnel ca  main article sutro tunnel while there was a scarcity of water on the surface there was an excess of water underground in all the mines floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped intrusion of scaldinghot water into the mines was a large problem and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased to overcome these troubles adolph sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the comstock lode from the lowest possible point a survey was made by schussler and work commenced in october  the sutro tunnel was completed from the valley near dayton through nearly four miles  feet of solid rock to meet the comstock mines approximately  ft  m beneath the surface two drain laterals were dug the north lateral was  feet long while the south lateral was  feet long the tunnel was  ft  m wide and  ft  m high inside of the timbering drain flumes were sunk in the floor and over these were two tracks for horse carts it required eight and a half years to reach the lode the tunnel drained up to  gallons daily– the tunnel provided drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravityassisted ore removal however by the time the tunnel reached the comstock area mines most of the ore above  ft  m had already been removed and the lower workings were  ft  m deeper still although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served the ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by compressed air for the use of pneumatic drills the tunnel connected with the savage claim on  july  all of the gold hill mines stopped pumping water by march  and allowed water to rise to the level of the tunnel the combination shaft ceased pumping below the tunnel on  oct  yellow jacket mine fireedit on the morning of april   a fire spread at the  foot level in the yellow jacket mine firefighters entered the mine but the smoke and flames pushed them back as the fire burned wood timbers collapsed and poisonous gases expanded into the adjacent kentucky and crown point mines the fires persisted and mine sections were sealed off and remained hot for several years at least thirty five miners died and some bodies were never retrieved the yellow jacket mine fire was the worst mining accident in nevada history up to that time later yearsedit remains of the combination shaft  the combination shaft located near virginia city began in  when the mine owners combined their efforts to sink a shaft to explore the comstock lode at a greater depth the combination was the deepest shaft ever sunk on the comstock reaching a depth of  feet it was used until  the total product of ore extracted and milled in the comstock district  to june   was  tons  pounds peak production from the comstock occurred in  with the mines producing over  of gold and  of silver that year about

period was at an end by – deep underground exploration and mining continued sporadically until  when the last of the pumps was shut off allowing the mines to flood up to the sutro tunnel level approximately  feet beneath virginia city all mining from  to present has taken place above the sutro tunnel level meanwhile through the early years of the th century ownership of mineral rights along the length of the comstock lode were consolidated primarily into a handful of companies most of them privately held this was a departure from the late s when upwards of  mining companies operated on the comstock with at least  of them publicly traded comstocks silver mines were criticized for the way that their share prices were manipulated on the san francisco stock exchanges and for the way that insiders skimmed the profits to the detriment of the common shareholders insiders used rumors or assessments to drive share prices down buy up the cheap shares then spread rumors of large new silver finds to increase prices once more so that they could sell their shares at a profit mining company managers also issued contracts to themselves for timber and water ore from the mines was commonly processed by ore mills owned by the company insiders who were accused of keeping part of the silver they extracted for themselves and refusing to make an accounting in  the united comstock mines company was organized by prominent comstock mining engineers roy hardy and alex wise with financial backing by new york businessman harry payne whitney united comstock consolidated ownership of

passable as they anticipated taking out more gold on reaching california orr named the gulch gold cañón other emigrants followed camped in the canyon and went to work at mining however when the supply of water in the canyon gave out toward the end of summer they continued across the mountains to california the camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of – when about  men worked part of the year along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers long toms and sluices after nine years the gold canyon placers were producing less and many miners left for the mono lake placers the gold from gold canyon came from quartz veins toward the head of the vein in the vicinity of where silver city and gold hill now stand as the miners worked their way up the stream they founded the town of johntown on a plateau in  the johntown miners found gold in sixmile canyon which is about five miles  km north of gold canyon the heads of both these canyons form the north and south ends of what

henry comstock was left in their stead to care for the grosh cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery grosh and bucke never made it to california getting lost and suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the sierra nevada mountains the two suffered from frostbite while crossing the sierras and at the hands of a minorsurgeon lost limbs through amputation a lastditch effort to save the lives of the pair allen grosh died on december   rm bucke lived but upon his recovery returned to his home in canada when henry t p comstock learned of the death of the grosh brothers he claimed the cabin and the lands as his own he also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man what he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein he continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the grosh brothers find was still unclaimed upon learning of a strike on gold hill which uncovered some bluish rock silver ore comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area gold hill discoveryedit four miners discovered the gold hill outcropping at the head of gold canyon making placer claims after finding traces of gold on  jan  they were james finney old virginny a contemporary rumor was that he changed his name from fennimore to finney after murdering a man john bishop big french john aleck henderson and jack yount these claims were followed by claims from lemuel s sandy bowers see bowers mansion joseph plato henry comstock james rogers and william knight in the spring of  after digging down to a depth of about ten feet they found a goldrich reddish quartz vein their discovery was actually part of the comstock lode the old red ledge– the four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the grosh brothers ophir discoveryedit in the spring of  two miners peter oriley and patrick mclaughlin finding all the paying ground already claimed went to the head of six mile canyon and began prospecting with a rocker on the slope of the mountain near a small stream fed from a neighboring spring they had poor results in the top dirt as there was no washed gravel and they were about to abandon their claim when they made the great discovery they sank a small deeper pit in which to collect water to use in their rockers in the bottom of this hole was a layer of rich black sand concentrate from the top of the hidden ophir bonanza henry t p comstock learned of the two men working on land that comstock allegedly had already claimed for grazing purposes unhappy with his current claim on gold hill comstock made threats and managed to work himself and his partner immanuel manny penrod into a deal that granted them interest on the claim on  june a trench they were digging exposed black manganese sand mixed with bluishgray quartz and gold two arrastras built by john d winters and ja osborn made them additional partners on  june comstock and penrod made an additional claim called the mexican but later called the spanish adjacent to the ophir claim–– with the blue stuff found in that trench silver mining in america as we know it was born in the rocker along with the gold was a large quantity of heavy blueblack material almost like putty which clogged the rocker and interfered with the washing out of the fine gold when assayed on  june however it was determined to be a rich sulfide of silver in fact the ore was three fourths

estimate even today most of them assumed they had made a small to modest strike like nearly all other gold strikes all of them knew they did not have the money or expertise to investigate the strike thoroughly the size of the strike and its potential value would take many years of extensive work by thousands of miners and the investments of millions of dollars—which none of them had weighing the

through surface diggings but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies unlike most silver ore deposits which occur in long thin veins those of the comstock lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick sometimes the ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated the weakness of the surrounding rock resulted in frequent and deadly caveins the excavations were carried to depths of more than  feet  m eventually after years of work the cavein problem was solved by the method of square set timbering invented by philip deidesheimer– a german mining engineer from san francisco who had been requested to survey the problem by the owners of the ophir mine previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings ribs capped by a third horizontal member to support the back roof creating a tunnel drift however the comstock ore bodies were not veins but sporadic pockets too large for this method instead as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side ribs front face or top back all at the same time thus the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice often these voids stopes would be refilled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete by this method of building up squares of framed timbers an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth deidesheimer was appointed to the ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea bullion mine virginia city c early in the history of comstock mining there were heavy flows of water to contend with this called for pumping machinery and apparatus and as greater depth was attained larger pumps were demanded all the inventive genius of the pacific coast was called into play and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found anywhere in the world initially the water was cold but the deeper workings cut into parts of the mountain where there were heavy flows of hot water mines dont always work in digging ore some parts of a mining operation could be deepening the existing shaft or exploring for more ore bodies this water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the geothermal pockets the hot water called for fans blowers and various kinds of ventilation apparatus as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the comstock mines diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use but were discarded for prospecting purposes being found unreliable several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed great improvements were also made in the hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work as the depth of the diggings increased the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical as their selfweight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength breaking weight after hemp rope iron chains began to become more common however fracture was quick at around half a millisecond in  wilhelm albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as albert rope in  andrew smith hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors his wire rope went on to be used in san franciscos famous cable cars and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the comstock lode another innovation were spring loaded cages the only way in and out of a shaft mine was in the cage cabled to the hoist all products men and supplies as well as recoverable ore travels up and down the shaft in a cage when the hemp rope or chains broke the cage would plummet uncontrolled to the bottom of the shaft killing its occupants or destroying its load cages were open to the front and rear with ibeams on both sides to support the floor the outside of the ibeams slid through wooden guides up and down the shaft top to bottom spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage one each attached to the ibeams through bolts and lifted in the center the outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous round head at the end notched with teeth molded into the rods the weight of the cage being lifted lifted the rods released the teeth and tightened the spring allowing the cage to move freely if the chain or cable broke the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood stopping the cage processingedit alta mine mill c  in  the americans knew nothing about silver mining john d winters jr and ja osborn built two arastras for the patio process at the ophir claim and gabriel maldonado a mexican of spanish descent began to smelt some of his rich ore in little adobe furnaces mexican fashion after purchasing penrods share of the mexican mine these methods proved to be too slow for the americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted the americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation some of the german miners who had been educated at the mining academy of freiberg were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores bagley introduced a variation of the freiberg process using the revolving barrel process of amalgamation and chloridizingroasting of ores after the stamp drycrushed while the barrel process was an improvement on the patio it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the comstock ores as pan amalgamation the comstock eventually developed the washoe process of using steamheated iron pans which reduced the weeks required by the patio process to hours– in the early days of pan processing of ores there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver mercury almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore they tried all manner of trash both mineral and vegetable including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea at that time untold millions in gold silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented there was much room for improvement improvements were made from time to time resulting in reductions in losses of metals but none of the apparatus in use on the comstock was perfect support infrastructureedit transportationedit carambo—caraja—sacramento—santa maria—diavolo the difficult trek by mule train from california  illustration from harpers before railroads were built all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from  to  horses or mules ore was hauled to the mills by these teams which also brought to the mines all the wood lumber and timber required teams also hauled over the sierra all the mining machinery all supplies required by both mines and mills and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons when the large reduction works of the ophir mining company were in peak operation lines of teams from one to three miles  km in length moved along the wagon roads and sometimes blocked virginia city streets for hours from  to  great quantities of goods were transported across the sierra to and from california on the backs of mules when the central pacific railroad line was completed to the truckee meadows this hauling was bidirectional from reno to virginia city via the geiger grade wagon road for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west– ground was broken on the virginia and truckee railroad on  feb  and by jan   the most difficult crookedest section from virginia city to carson city was completed rails were extended north across the washoe valley from carson city to reno where it connected with the central pacific– between virginia city and carson city at mound house the railroad also connected with the carson and colorado railroad the virginia city and gold hill water companyedit when silver was first discovered on the comstock the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of virginia city and gold hill nevada as population increased wells were dug for domestic needs and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply as the mills and hoisting works multiplied the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents now thousands in number in this need the virginia city and gold hill water company was formed being the first nonmining incorporation on the comstock lode water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted it became imperative to look toward the main range of the sierra nevada mountains where there was an inexhaustible supply between the sierra and the virginia ranges lay the washoe valley a great trough nearly  ft  m in depth hermann schussler a swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in san francisco was brought to the comstock to plan and design the new works surveys were made in  the first sections of pipe laid june   and the last on july  the same year the initial pipe was made of wrought iron a total length of over  mi  km with an interior diameter of  in  mm and a capacity of  gallons per hour the pipe traversed the washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon and at the lowest point having a pressure of  ft  m of water– or  pounds per square inch the inlet being  ft  m above the outlet the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure water was brought to the inlet in the sierra nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of  mi  km to virginia city the pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together each section fastened with three rows of rivets lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section the first flow of water reached gold hill and virginia city on august   with great fanfare this accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world having superseded the water system at cherokee flat also designed by schussler the water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in  and a third pipe in  these pipes of lap welded joints delivered more water there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply sutro tunneledit sutro tunnel ca  main article sutro tunnel while there was a scarcity of water on the surface there was an excess of water underground in all the mines floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped intrusion of scaldinghot water into the mines was a large problem and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased to overcome these troubles adolph sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the comstock lode from the lowest possible point a survey was made by schussler and work commenced in october  the sutro tunnel was completed from the valley near dayton through nearly four miles  feet of solid rock to meet the comstock mines approximately  ft  m beneath the surface two drain laterals were dug the north lateral was  feet long while the south lateral was  feet long the tunnel was  ft  m wide and  ft  m high inside of the timbering drain flumes were sunk in the floor and over these were two tracks for horse carts it required eight and a half years to reach the lode the tunnel drained up to  gallons daily– the tunnel provided drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravityassisted ore removal however by the time the tunnel reached the comstock area mines most of the ore above  ft  m had already been removed and the lower workings were  ft  m deeper still although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served the ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by compressed air for the use of pneumatic drills the tunnel connected with the savage claim on  july  all of the gold hill mines stopped pumping water by march  and allowed water to rise to the level of the tunnel the combination shaft ceased pumping below the tunnel on  oct  yellow jacket mine fireedit on the morning of april   a fire spread at the  foot level in the yellow jacket mine firefighters entered the mine but the smoke and flames pushed them back as the fire burned wood timbers collapsed and poisonous gases expanded into the adjacent kentucky and crown point mines the fires persisted and mine sections were sealed off and remained hot for several years at least thirty five miners died and some bodies were never retrieved the yellow jacket mine fire was the worst mining accident in nevada history up to that time later yearsedit remains of the combination shaft  the combination shaft located near virginia city began in  when the mine owners combined their efforts to sink a shaft to explore the comstock lode at a greater depth the combination was the deepest shaft ever sunk on the comstock reaching a depth of  feet it was used until  the total product of ore extracted and milled in the comstock district  to june   was  tons  pounds peak production from the comstock occurred in  with the mines producing over  of gold and  of silver that year about  and  today the deepest depth reached in  was by the ophirmexican winze at  ft  m below the surface production from comstock mines from  to  was  with a net profit of  most of that in the s the bonanza period was at an end by – deep underground exploration and mining continued sporadically until  when the last of the pumps was shut off allowing the mines to flood up to the sutro tunnel level approximately  feet beneath virginia city all mining from  to present has taken place above the sutro tunnel level meanwhile through the early years of the th century ownership of mineral rights along the length of the comstock lode were consolidated primarily into a handful of companies most of them privately held this was a departure from the late s when upwards of  mining companies operated on the comstock with at least  of them publicly traded comstocks silver mines were criticized for the way that their share prices were manipulated on the san francisco stock exchanges and for the way that insiders skimmed the profits to the detriment of the common shareholders insiders used rumors or assessments to drive share prices down buy up the cheap shares then spread rumors of large new silver finds to increase prices once more so that they could sell their shares at a profit mining company managers also issued contracts to themselves for timber and water ore from the mines was commonly processed by ore mills owned by the company insiders who were accused of keeping part of the silver they extracted for themselves and refusing to make an accounting in  the united comstock mines company was organized by prominent comstock mining engineers roy hardy and alex wise with financial backing by new york businessman harry payne whitney united comstock consolidated ownership of the entire gold hill section of the comstock lode representing  feet of strike length and a mill site in american flat this enterprise constructed the  tonperday capacity american flat cyanide mill the largest in the world at the time and drove a tunnel  feet from the mill under gold hill the economics of this project were tenuous and with a drop in silver prices it closed in – in  the federal government raised the price of gold from  to  per ounce which vastly improved the economics of projects on the comstock several companies embarked on substantial projects including arizona comstock company in  began underground mining through the hale  norcross tunnel followed quickly by a surface mine known as the loring cut and located across from the fourth ward school arizona comstock processed their ore at a ton per day flotation plant located near the hale  norcross portal but the flotation method alone turned out to be relatively ineffective at recovering comstock gold and silver and this operation shut down by – dayton consolidated the dayton consolidated mill in silver city processed ore from its own mine as well as operating as a custom mill for a number of mines in the area con chollar the con chollar mining company built a  tonperday flotation mill near the south end of gold hill to reprocess tailings from several nearby mines it later processed ore from the overman pit in the same section of the lode sutro tunnel coalitioncrown point mill after several years of exploration and development on the crown point claim in gold hill the sutro tunnel coalition built a  tonperday cyanide mill to process both underground and surface mined ore in  the mill and mine development was accomplished with a  loan from the reconstruction finance corporation which was paid back in under  years of operation the crown point mill operated profitably treating primarily ores from the crown point and yellow jacket claims until it was shut down by war production board order l in – exploration and production of varying scales and in varying locations have been undertaken on the comstock lode in every decade since its discovery there was a particular flurry of activity including major surface mining operations by the houston oil and mineral company followed by united mining in the late s and early s this activity paralleled a rapid and substantial rise in the price of gold and silver which was unpegged from the dollar by president nixon in  today the comstock lode is being explored by comstock mining inc nyse mkt lode of virginia city nevada who has consolidated control of approximately  of comstock mining claims on september   comstock mining inc returned gold and silver production to the comstock with their first pour of doré bullion and continues surface mining in lower gold hill legacyedit nevada is commonly called the silver state because of the silver produced from the comstock lode however since  nevada has been a relatively minor silver producer with most subsequent bonanzas consisting of more gold than silver in  jim butler discovered nevadas second largest silver strike in tonopah nevada nevada is currently ranked as the second largest producer of silver within the united states nevadas leading silver producer is the rochester mine in pershing county this mine falls behind the greens creek mine in alaska the largest producer of silver within the us according to dan de quille a journalist of the period the discovery of silver undoubtedly deserves to rank in merit above the discovery of the gold mines of california as it gives value to a much greater area of territory and furnishes employment to a much larger number of people fortunes madeedit main article
