pharmaceuticals inc is being obliterated today shares collapsed after the company announced that it will discontinue development of some of its most promising product candidates brian feroldi tmftypeoh nov   at pm image source getty images what happened it is a rough day to be an investor in arrowhead pharmaceuticals nasdaqarwr shares of the clinicalstage biotech are collapsing falling more than  as of  am est on tuesday in response to the news that the company is abandoning clinical development of several of its latestage compounds so what arrowhead announced today that it will discontinue development of arc arc and arcaat which are three of its most promising clinicalstage drugs in addition management has decided to reduce its workforce by approximately  this decision was made mostly in response to the clinical hold that was placed on arrowheads heparc study which was researching the companys lead compound arc as a potential cure for hepatitis b arrowhead had previously disclosed that the fda had ordered the clinical hold so the company could answer liver toxicology questions related to ex the companys intravenously administered delivery vehicle which is used with arc arc and arcaat management announced on wednesday that gathering all of the clinical data to alleviate the fdas concerns over ex would take at least  months and even then there wouldnt be a guarantee of success instead of waiting and potentially wasting resources management felt the prudent decision was to discontinue development of the drugs and refocus the companys efforts on its other clinical programs now what theres no doubt that this news blows a hole in the bull case for the stock arc in particular held promise to potentially cure patients of hepatitis b which is a disease that afflicts roughly  million people globally if arrowhead could have brought it across the finish line it could have easily turned into a blockbuster so it is painful to see the company abandoning it now looking ahead arrowhead plans on throwing all of its might behind its preclinical subcutaneous and extrahepatic programs included in this list are the drugs arclpa and arcamg both of which are partnered with the biotech giant amgen nasdaqamgn after accounting for the layoffs and recent payments from amgen arrowhead expects to have enough capital to keep its doors open into  that should be enough time for the company to make some progress on its other programs and provide clinical data that could get its stock moving back in the right direction regardless arrowhead was already a highrisk stock and todays news raises the companys risk profile even more i for one now plan on keeping far away from this oncepromising company brian feroldi has no position in any stocks mentioned
