required under the conditions of the application is significant and provides for additional procedures and processes to ensure that the regulated entity is being treated fairly in respect of potential coinvestment transactions  if the advisors to a regulated entity determine that a potential coinvestment opportunity is appropriate for the regulated entity and the applicable triloma advisor approves the investment for such regulated entity and one or more other regulated entities andor one or more affiliated investors may also participate the advisors will present the investment opportunity to the eligible trustees  of the regulated entity prior to the actual investment by the regulated entity as to any regulated entity a coinvestment transaction will be consummated only upon approval by a required majority of the eligible trustees of such regulated entity within the meaning of section o of the act “required majority”  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the

controlling controlled by or under common control with the advisor or its the principals and any affiliated investors collectively the “holders” own in the aggregate more than  of the outstanding voting securities of a regulated entity “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent trustees will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of the advisor or its principals to influence the independent trustees by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent trustees can be removed will be limited significantly applicants represent that the independent trustees shall evaluate and approve any such independent third party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profitsharing plan” as defined in the rule without prior approval by the commission by order upon application section d of the act and rule d under the act are applicable to regulated entities that

principal knowingly to effect any transaction in which the bdc or a company controlled by such bdc is a joint or a joint and several participant with that person in contravention of rules as prescribed by the commission because the commission has not adopted any rules expressly under section a section i provides that the rules under section d applicable to registered closedend investment

profitsharing plan in which the bdc or a company controlled by such bdc is a participant unless an application regarding the joint enterprise arrangement or profitsharing plan has been filed with the commission and has been granted by an order entered prior to the submission of the plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval or prior to its adoption or modification if not so

“affiliated person” of each other regulated entity within the meaning of section a of the act applicants state that the regulated entities by virtue of each having a triloma advisor may be deemed to be under common control and thus affiliated persons of each other under section ac of the act section d and section b apply to any investment adviser to a closedend fund or a bdc respectively including the subadviser thus an eig advisor and any affiliated investors that it advises could be deemed to be persons related to regulated entities in a manner described by sections d and b and therefore prohibited by sections d and a and rule d from participating in the coinvestment program applicants further submit that because the eig advisors are “affiliated persons” of other eig advisors affiliated investors advised by any of them could be deemed to be persons related to regulated entities or a company controlled by a regulated entity in a manner described by sections d and b
