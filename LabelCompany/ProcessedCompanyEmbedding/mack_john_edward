remembrances audiovideo john e mack md bio books by john e mack facebook biography of john e mack md john mack hiking in  photograph courtesy of the family of dr mack john edward mack md oct   – sep   was a pulitzer prizewinning biographer and a professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school he won the pulitzer prize in biography in  for a prince of our disorder his biography of t e lawrence a british officer stationed in the middle east who became known as “lawrence of arabia” dr mack embraced a worldview inspired by elements of spiritual and philosophical traditions which hold that we are all connected to one another the theme of “connection” to other life was explored most boldly in his study of men and women who reported that recurrent “alien encounter” experiences had affected the way they regarded the world including a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern mack’s interest in the transformational aspects of these extraordinary experiences and his suggestion that the experience may be more transcendent than physical in nature – yet nonetheless real – was largely reported in the media as a simple endorsement of the reality of alien encounters earlier in his career he explored how this sense of “connection” developed between different cultures interviewing political leaders and citizens of the thensoviet union and israelpalestine in the study of ethnonational conflict and the nuclear arms race in the s mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the cold war including former president jimmy carter and the “father of the hydrogen bomb” edward teller together with luminaries such as carl sagan mack and other physicians for social responsibility the us affiliate of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the united states and the ussr emboldened by the organization’s receipt of the nobel peace prize in  mack sagan and  other academics walked upon the grounds of the nevada test site in the summer of  setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility dr mack suggested that a materialist worldview was the root cause of longsimmering conflicts between the west and other cultures and was responsible for the global ecological crisis a shift in perspective was required he suggested to restore people’s appreciation of connections to one another and to the natural world mack’s final published book passport to the cosmos human transformation and alien encounters  was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern worldviews as it was the culmination of his work with “experiencers” of alien encounters dr mack’s credentials provided him with some measure of protection from critics he received his medical degree from the harvard medical school cum laude  after undergraduate study at oberlin phi beta kappa  a graduate of the boston psychoanalytic society and institute and board certified in child and adult psychoanalysis he founded the department of psychiatry of the cambridge hospital the teaching hospital of harvard medical school nonetheless in  the dean of harvard medical school appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review mack’s clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him because the committee was not a disciplinary committee it was not governed by any established rules of procedure the presentation of a defense was therefore difficult and costly for mack upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for mack’s defense ten months into the process questions arose from the academic community including harvard’s own professor of law alan dershowitz about the validity of an openended investigation of a fulltime professor who was not subject to any claim of ethics violation or professional misconduct after fourteen months of inquiry harvard issued a statement stating that the dean had “reaffirmed dr mack’s academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment” concluding “dr mack remains a member in good standing of the harvard faculty of medicine” dr mack was born in new york city and died in london at age  listen to a bbc special about dr mack mp biographie de john e mack md français john e mack naît le  octobre  il fait ses études à oberlin phi beta kappa  en  il obtient son diplôme médical de l’ecole médicale de harvard medical cum laude il est diplômé de la société et institut psychoanalytique de boston et est certifié en psychoanalyse pour enfant et adulte mack fonde l’unité d’enseignement psychiatrique au cambridge hospital de harvard medical school le thème dominant du travail de sa vie est l’exploration de comment les perceptions du monde de quelqu’un affectent ses relations il traite cette question de la “vision du monde” au niveau individuel dans ses premières explorations cliniques sur les rêves cauchemars et suicide des jeunes et dans son étude biographique de la vie de l’officier britannique t e lawrence “lawrence d’arabie” pour laquelle il reçoit le prix pulitzer en biographie en  mack pense que la culture occidentale a besoin de s’éloigner d’une vision du monde purement matérialiste qu’il considère responsable de la guerre froide la crise économique globale l’ethnonationalisme et les conflits régionaux au profit d’une vision du monde transpersonnelle embrassant certains élements des traditions spirituelles et philosophiques orientales l’intérêt de mack pour l’aspect spirituel de l’expérience humaine est comparée par le new york times à celle du william james qui fut également à harvard qui comme lui fut controversé pour ses efforts à relier spiritualité et psychiatrie c’est dans ce même élan que mack devient encore plus controversé au début des années s il entâme une étude de plus de  ans sur  hommes et femmes déclarant que des expériences de rencontre extraterrestre ont affecté leur vision du monde accroissant notamment leur sens de la spiritualité et leur préoccupation de l’environment l’intérêt de mack pour les aspects spirituels ou transformationnels des rencontres extraterrestres des gens ainsi que sa suggestion que l’experience d’un contact extraterrestre puisse être de nature plus spirituel que physique — bien que néanmoins réelle — le placent à part de nombre de ses contemporains comme budd hopkins qui défend la réalité physique des extraterrestres selon mack  les enlèvements s’apparentent à une expérience psychologique et spirituelle qui se produit et trouve peutêtre son origine dans une autre dimension ce sont donc des phénomènes qui nous ouvrent ou du moins nous obligent à être ouverts à des réalités qui n’appartiennent pas uniquement à notre monde physique irrité par l’orientation des travaux de mack et estimant qu’il a failli aux normes d’investigation de l’université le doyen d’harvard demande en  à un comité d’éthique d’évaluer la validité de ses recherches en  le comité admit que mack n’avait pas violé les règles déontologiques de la profession l’avocat de mack précise que ce dernier ne croit pas nécessairement aux extraterrestres venus de l’espace mais qu’il ne croit pas non plus à la thèse de la maladie mentale de ses patients john mack est mort à londres sur  septembre  biografia de john e mack md português john edward mack  de outubro de  –  de setembro de  foi um biógrafo galardoado com o prémio pulitzer e professor de psiquiatria na harvard medical school recebeu o prémio pulitzer na categoria de biografia em  pela obra a prince of our disorder sobre a vida de et lawrence um oficial britânico estacionado no médio oriente mais conhecido por “lawrence da arábia” mack adoptou uma visão do mundo inspirada por elementos de tradições espirituais e filosóficas que defendem que todos nós estamos interligados a questão da “ligação” a outras formas de vida foi corajosamente explorada no seu estudo de indivíduos de ambos os sexos que afirmavam que repetidas experiências de “encontros com extraterrestres” tinham influenciado o modo como encaram o mundo incluindo um acentuado sentido de espiritualidade e de preocupação ambiental o interesse de mack pelos aspectos transformacionais destas extraordinárias experiências bem como a sua sugestão de que a experiência poderá ser de natureza mais transcendental do que física – mas não obstante real – foi largamente divulgado pelos meios de comunicação como uma simples aceitação da realidade de encontros com extraterrestres num período anterior da sua carreira mack tinha explorado como este sentido de “ligação” se desenvolvia entre culturas diferentes ao entrevistar líderes políticos e cidadãos da então união soviética de israel e da palestina no estudo de conflitos étniconacionais e da corrida ao armamento nuclear nos anos  como parte da sua investigação sobre as causas profundas da guerra fria mack entrevistou várias figuras políticas internacionais incluindo o antigo presidente norteamericano jimmy carter e edward teller o “pai da bomba de hidrogénio” juntamente com figuras brilhantes como carl sagan mack e outros membros da physicians for social responsibility médicos para a responsabilidade social organização norteamericana afiliada na international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war médicos internacionais para a prevenção da guerra nuclear promoveram a eliminação das armas nucleares e um fim para o conflito latente entre os estados unidos e a união soviética encorajados pelo prémio nobel da paz que a organização recebeu em  john e mack e carl sagan em conjunto com outros  académicos marcharam nos terrenos das instalações do centro de ensaios nucleares de nevada no verão de  estabelecendo um recorde de desobediência civil para aquele local de testes de armas nucleares mack sugeriu que a visão materialista do mundo estava na origem dos conflitos há muito latentes entre o ocidente e outras culturas e era responsável pela crise ecológica à escala global segundo ele era necessária uma mudança de perspectiva para restabelecer a nossa apreciação pelas ligações com os outros e com a natureza o seu último livro passport to the cosmos human transformation and alien encounters publicado em  foi simultaneamente um tratado filosófico estabelecendo a ligação entre os temas da espiritualidade e das modernas visões do mundo e o culminar do seu trabalho com “experienciadores” de encontros com extraterrestres as qualificações de mack ofereceramlhe um certo grau de protecção em relação aos críticos formouse em medicina cum laude na harvard medical school em  após estudos no oberlin college phi beta kappa  efectuou estudos de pósgraduação no boston psychoanalytic society and institute foi certificado em psicanálise infantil e do adulto john e mack fundou o departamento de psiquiatria do cambridge hospital o hospital universitário da harvard medical school todavia em  o reitor da harvard medical school nomeou um comité para examinar confidencialmente os cuidados clínicos e a investigação clínica de mack nos indivíduos que com ele partilharam os seus encontros com extraterrestres não sendo este comité um comité disciplinar não estava regulado por quaisquer regras de procedimento estabelecidas a apresentação de uma defesa foi portanto difícil e dispendiosa para mack ao ser revelada publicamente a existência do comité a revelação pública ocorreu inadvertidamente dez meses após o início do processo aquando da convocação de testemunhas para a defesa de mack surgiram questões por parte da comunidade académica incluindo um professor de direito em harvard alan dershowitz sobre a legitimidade de uma investigação por tempo indeterminado a um professor que não era acusado de qualquer violação de conduta ética ou de normas deontológicas da profissão após catorze meses de inquérito harvard emitiu uma declaração anunciando que o reitor “reiterou a liberdade académica do dr mack para estudar o que deseja e para expor as suas opiniões sem entraves” concluindo que “o dr mack continua a ser um membro de boa reputação na faculdade de medicina de harvard” john e mack nasceu

as that page now displays a copy of the wikipedia article notably so this concern seems not or at least no longer applicable meco talk   november  utc connection is a scientific realityedit mack had a world view inspired by elements of spiritual and philosophical traditions which hold that people are all connected to one another that people are all connected to one another is the dominant scientific theory referred to as the universal common ancestor neil degrasse tyson famously said we are all connected to each other biologically to the earth chemically to the rest of the universe atomically we know that all life on earth evolved from a singlecelled organism that lived roughly  billion years ago and that we are all connected at the most basic atomic level on up from the air we breathe to the food we eat to the technology we share and interact with on a daily level this has less to do with a world view inspired by spirituality and philosophical traditions and more to do with observable evidence about the universe viriditas talk   november  utc viriditas that may be true but in this context macks belief in connection is based on the eastern influences present in the field of transpersonal psychology since dr mack was a psychiatrist not a biologist or a chemist perhaps an interlink to transpersonal psychology could be worked into the paragraph   december  utc — preceding unsigned comment added by  talk investigationedit according to daniel sheehan macks attorney the committees draft report… this addition is problematic and i am not sure how best to resolve it although the sentence begins with the conditional statement according to the next hundred words of sheehans excessivelylong quote give the impression of being direct quotes from the ad hoc committees draft report but they are simply sheehans interpretation of that report or his interpretation of the beliefs of the authors of that report relying upon only one persons perspective for such a large section it is a full third of the investigation section does not conform to best practices so i will trim back sheehans remarks a bit and i will advise finding a second and third source to convey more info about the report a secondary minor problem associated with this addition is that sheehan is introduced as macks attorney before the next paragraph which more properly introduced eric macleish and daniel sheehan as macks attorneys willbueche talk   april  utc update i made sheehans quote more succinct but it is still problematic because it is partly false sheehan said they demanded mack use every possible available battery of standard psychological tests which might conceivably explain the report as the product of some known form of clinical psychosis but in fact the report emphasized that absent any evidence of mental illness mack should have considered nonpathological psychological explanations sheehans claim they expected mack would find clinical psychosis is hyperbole i checked the report myself to see what they wrote again this is the problem with using one person as a sourcewillbueche talk   april  utc external links modifiededit hello fellow
