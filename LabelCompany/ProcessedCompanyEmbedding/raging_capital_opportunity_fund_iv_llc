prnewswire  raging capital management llc raging capital one of the largest shareholders of ezchip semiconductor ltd nasdaq ezch ezchip owning approximately  of the ordinary shares outstanding issued a letter to ezchip shareholders today expressing its strong opposition to the  per share buyout offer from mellanox technologies ltd nasdaq mlnx mellanox  raging capital intends to not only vote against the mellanox acquisition but to vigorously oppose the deal by soliciting proxies from the shareholders against approval of the acquisition at the annual general meeting of shareholders of ezchip scheduled to be held on november   the general meeting in addition raging capital has nominated ken traub and paul mcwilliams for election to the ezchip board at the general meeting  in light of its significant concerns with the mellanox acquisition raging capital believes representation on the board is necessary to protect the interests of all shareholders and intends to also solicit proxies for the election of messrs traub and mcwilliams at the general meeting in the letter issued to ezchip shareholders william c martin chairman and chief investment officer of raging capital stated we believe ezchip is a fast growing market leader in an expanding multibillion dollar market with a strong balance sheet longlife product portfolio and extraordinary potential  mr martin highlighted in the letter that major competitors marvell technologies and broadcom have exited the network processor market leaving ezchip as the only source for providing these critical networking technologies  in addition mr martin detailed how new design wins for ezchips nps and tilemx processor chips will add significant value for shareholders over the next few years which value is not reflected in the  offer price commenting on the proposed sale to mellanox mr martin stated the board of directors conducted a very condensed sale process only negotiating with one potential buyer – mellanox and performed a very limited market check with other potential suitors a few short days prior to executing the merger agreement which gave no other potential acquirers a reasonable chance to

the full text of the letter follows raging capital urges shareholders to vote against the proposed merger of convenience between ezchip semiconductor and mellanox technologies why the mellanox merger agreement is a bad deal for shareholders of ezchip semiconductor vote the gold proxy card when available october   dear fellow shareholders raging capital management llc is a longterm valueoriented investor that owns  ordinary shares of ezchip semiconductor ltd ezchip or the company constituting approximately  of the shares outstanding making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we built this position prior to the recent illadvised acquisition offer discussed below with the belief that ezchip is a fastgrowing market leader in an expanding multibillion dollar market with a strong balance sheet longlife product portfolio and extraordinary potential  we are writing today to express our view that the  per share consideration offered by mellanox technologies ltd mellanox to acquire ezchip considerably undervalues the company and its future prospects  we believe ezchip has enormous potential to grow as an independent public company and should not be sold at this time  however if the company should be sold we believe the board has an obligation to conduct a thorough process designed to maximize shareholder value it is apparent that this has not taken place  as such we intend to vote against this transaction at the november   annual general meeting of shareholders and encourage you to do the same  heres why    ezchips dominant position in the network processor market has been further strengthened with  marvells recent market exit after a long battle for market share ezchip has prevailed with its leadingedge technology in the network processing market  in fact marvell technologies once a primary competitor to ezchip recently announced it is exiting the market and will instead partner with ezchip to provide its customers with critical processor technology  another major competitor in this space broadcom exited the market several years ago  this leaves ezchip as the only source for providing merchant network processing technologies  marvells exit from the market should translate into significant new growth opportunities for ezchip and has not been accurately reflected in the financial projections provided by the company to justify the value of the  sale price to mellanox ezchips new nps will radically expand addressable market validated by key design wins following three years of significant investment in research and development ezchip is now prepared to sample its nps chip for the first time this quarter ezchips forthcoming nps processors are wellpositioned to capitalize on the emerging trends of white box networking softwaredefined networking sdn and network functions virtualization nfv that are all key to the evolution and growth of the communication networks of the future  more specifically the nps leapfrogs existing technologies by handling layers  processing with a customerfriendly cprogrammable interface we believe nps will radically expand the total addressable market and potential customer base for ezchip  to support this we look no further than ezchips recently announced nps design wins with several new customers including a tier one carrier a tier one switch provider and a hyper scale data center operator additionally ezchip has secured design wins from longtime customers such as zte  yet we believe ezchip is just scratching the surface of nps potential according to statements from ezchips management the company will initiate shipments of nps development devices later this year and begin shipping production volume in   based on historical ezchip sales data we believe this could drive  nps revenue in excess of  million in  when ezchip is also scheduled to initiate shipments of its new tilemx development devices  revenue generated from these new devices should ramp up significantly in  and beyond  according to ezchip these new devices should expand ezchips total addressable market six fold to  billion in   due to the fact that ezchip has publicly stated that most of the development costs associated with these new devices are behind them the incremental operating margins associated with these new sales should be significant   in our opinion the  per share acquisition proposal not only undervalues the existing business and its future potential but mellanox is also essentially getting nps for free tilemx investments will generate significant value in  and beyond in  ezchip spent  million to acquire tilera a provider of multicore processing chips  with this acquisition ezchip doubled its served available market and became a more diversified preeminent supplier of highend technologies to the data center market  since the acquisition ezchip has invested heavily into tileras next generation product the tilemx processor  an armbased multicore chip that will incorporate ezchips bestofbreed networking processor and accelerator capabilities  targeted at the fastgrowing data center market the tilemx will further expand ezchips addressable market to over  billion by    we believe the tilemx growth opportunity is assigned no value by the mellanox acquisition offer cisco revenues to remain strong for years market has misinterpreted and overreacted and therefore it is inappropriate to sell at a modest premium to the depressed price following the cisco news earlier this year ezchip disclosed that cisco plans to use an internally developed asic for the next generation of its highend routers  this announcement led to a sharp albeit transitory decline in ezchips share value – providing mellanox with the opportunity to make a lowball offer  subsequently ezchip has provided additional information about its strong relationship with cisco including the fact that ezchip has secured additional design wins within cisco for its nps chip and that a material portion of the ciscogenerated revenues are not at risk at all  furthermore in a recent interviewi ezchips ceo eli fruchter stated that the potential hit to revenue will come in  and no problem is foreseen until then  he also noted there is no doubt that even alone ezchip would have succeeded in offsetting the damage  later in the same article mr fruchter also said that ciscos decision could also yet change we dont think that the last word has been said on the matter  interestingly enough a recent research report from inflection point research stated that from a pl analysis it is hard to justify the roi for doing an asic for the next gen asrk and cisco with their new management team knows it  inflection point further asserted its belief that csco will most likely end up using ezchip and not develop their own asic the bottom line here is that ezchip remains a critical supplier to cisco and will likely continue to be for many years to come  in our view the market misinterpreted and unduly discounted ezchips share price when the cisco news came out and therefore it is inappropriate to sell ezchip at a modest premium to this inappropriately and temporarily discounted price the ezchipmellanox merger appears to be a marriage of convenience rather than the result of a robust and rigorous sale process in the same article referenced earlier mr fruchter commented it was fairly clear that we would join together someday while mellanoxs ceo eyal waldman added weve been talking about the merger for several years  furthermore it is made abundantly clear in ezchips proxy materials that the board of directors failed to implement a full fair and competitive bidding process – but instead were determined to sell the business to longstanding friends nearby in yokneam at a valuation that clearly does not reflect the full value of the company according to ezchips proxy materials describing the sale the board of directors conducted a very condensed sale process only negotiating with one potential buyer – mellanox and performed a very limited market check with other potential suitors a few short days prior to executing the merger agreement which gave no other potential acquirers a reasonable chance to make a competitive offer  we have confirmed with prominent investment bankers as well as logical potential acquirers that the business was not actively marketed for sale following the merger announcement we asked ezchips ceo eli fruchter why sell for  per share and he responded i just pulled a number that i thought was very high when the stock was trading at  per share in our opinion the board failed to conduct a robust and rigorous process to sell the company as a result shareholders are being asked to approve an acquisition in which the transaction price is significantly below what the company is actually worth mellanox offer does not reflect full value for ezchip and its prospects investors do not yet fully appreciate how the companys next generation programmable nps processors can transform the companys revenue stream beginning within the next two yearsii its optically not that attractive of an offeriii gary mobley sellside analyst with benchmark company llc covering ezchip in our opinion the  per share acquisition price offered by mellanox on september   is not a fair or appropriate buyout value for ezchips existing business and neglects to adequately compensate shareholders for the substantial value potential associated with marvells exit from the market new products design wins and favorable industry trends that will help to drive the companys future growth and profitability  the most important factor to understand and appreciate is the immense amount of operating leverage in ezchips business model  remember the bulk of the development costs of nps and tilemx are already running through the companys income statement this means that a high percentage of the high margin incremental revenues from nps and tilemx will drop directly to the bottom line  additionally israels office of the chief scientist provides a very favorable tax regime and ezchip has already prepaid many of its future tax liabilities this favorable operating leverage profile provides significant potential upside while downside risks are limited by ezchips substantial net cash balance and strong ongoing operating cash flows from longlife design wins  for ezchip shareholders this provides a very attractive riskreward setup with limited downside risk and massive upside potential  again why sell now  ezch earnings estimates upside driven by immense operating leverage fiscal year end      earnings per share eps core business¹      nps  tilemx eps contribution²      aggregate eps core business

million shares outstanding  assumes  million annual capital expenditures  million in annual office of chief scientist tax payments   next steps to ensure shareholder value is protected and maximized ezchip is a great company with bestinclass products excellent engineering capabilities and extraordinary people  it is our belief that ezchip can and will continue to thrive as a standalone business far into the foreseeable future  in the event that a sale of ezchip is not consummated we would like to see the board take the following steps consider executing a  million share repurchase program  ezchip announced a modest  million share repurchase program in a press release issued march    in this press release ezchip ceo eli fruchter stated  we believe the share repurchase program represents a good use of the companys capital and the boards confidence in ezchips long term prospects and is consistent with the goal of increasing shareholder value  we continue to believe both our current and new products are well positioned to drive meaningful growth over the next several years and we remain highly optimistic about our shortterm midterm and longterm performance ezchip has a strong balance sheet with nearly  million of cash onhand and no debt and it is a business that will continue to generate sustainable free cash flows far into the future  in the event that a sale of ezchip is not consummated and the market does not recognize the full longerterm value of the business we would like the company to expand its openmarket share repurchase program for the benefit of shareholders as shares are redeemed in an accretive fashion immediately reconstitute the board with the addition of two new board members having relevant industry experience and strong transactional expertise  toward this end raging capital has nominated two wellqualified candidates who are prepared to protect all shareholders interests by helping ezchip to continue to grow as an independent company if and when it is appropriate to sell the company they would help execute and oversee a comprehensive sale process that would ensure shareholder value is maximized   if elected these new board members would occupy just two of seven board seats but would be instrumental in their role as advocates for shareholders instituting appropriate governance oversight sustainable economic performance and longterm value creation  furthermore if elected these candidates will seek to work constructively with the other directors to ensure your value is protected about our nominees kenneth traub has over  years of

several years  furthermore it is made abundantly clear in ezchips proxy materials that the board of directors failed to implement a full fair and competitive bidding process – but instead were determined to sell the business to longstanding friends nearby in yokneam at a valuation that clearly does not reflect the full value of the company according to ezchips proxy materials describing the sale the board of directors conducted a very condensed sale process only negotiating with one potential buyer – mellanox and performed a very limited market check with other potential suitors a few short days prior to executing the merger agreement which gave no other potential acquirers a reasonable chance to make a competitive offer  we have confirmed with prominent investment bankers as well as logical potential acquirers that the business was not actively marketed for sale following the merger announcement we asked ezchips ceo eli fruchter why sell for  per share and he responded i just pulled a number that i thought was very high when the stock was trading at  per share in our opinion the board failed to conduct a robust and rigorous process to sell the company as a result shareholders are being asked to approve an acquisition in which the transaction price is significantly below what the company is actually worth mellanox offer does not reflect full value for ezchip and its prospects investors do not yet fully appreciate how the companys next generation programmable nps processors can transform the companys revenue stream beginning within the next two yearsii its optically not that attractive of an offeriii gary mobley sellside analyst with benchmark company llc covering ezchip in our opinion the  per share acquisition price offered by mellanox on september   is not a fair or appropriate buyout value for ezchips existing business and neglects to adequately compensate shareholders for the substantial value potential associated with marvells exit from the market new products design wins and favorable industry trends that will help to drive the companys future growth and profitability  the most important factor to understand and appreciate is the immense amount of operating leverage in ezchips business model  remember the bulk of the development costs of nps and tilemx are already running through the companys income statement this means that a high percentage of the high margin incremental revenues from nps and tilemx will drop directly to the bottom line  additionally israels office of the chief scientist provides a very favorable tax regime and ezchip has already prepaid many of its future tax liabilities this favorable operating leverage profile provides significant potential upside while downside risks are limited by ezchips substantial net cash balance and strong ongoing operating cash flows from longlife design wins  for ezchip shareholders this provides a very attractive riskreward setup with limited downside risk and massive upside potential  again why sell now  ezch earnings estimates upside driven by immense operating leverage fiscal year end      earnings per share eps core business¹      nps  tilemx eps

incremental annual operating expense  tax rate and  million shares outstanding  assumes  million annual capital expenditures  million in annual office of chief scientist tax payments   next steps to ensure shareholder value is protected and maximized ezchip is a great company with bestinclass products excellent engineering capabilities and extraordinary people  it is our belief that ezchip can and will continue to thrive as a standalone business far into the foreseeable future  in the event that a sale of ezchip is not consummated we would like to see the board take the following steps consider executing a  million share repurchase program  ezchip announced a modest  million share repurchase program in a press release issued march    in this press release ezchip ceo eli fruchter stated  we believe the share repurchase program represents a good use of the companys capital and the boards confidence in ezchips long term prospects and is consistent with the goal of increasing shareholder value  we continue to believe both our current and new products are well positioned to drive meaningful growth over the next several years and we remain highly optimistic about our shortterm midterm and longterm performance ezchip has a strong balance sheet with nearly  million of cash onhand and no debt and it is a business that will continue to generate sustainable free cash flows far into the future  in the event that a sale of ezchip is not consummated and the market does not recognize the full longerterm value of the business we would like the company to expand its openmarket share repurchase program for the benefit of shareholders as shares are redeemed in an accretive fashion immediately reconstitute the board with the addition of two new board members having relevant industry experience and strong transactional expertise  toward this end raging capital has nominated two wellqualified candidates who are prepared to protect all shareholders interests by helping ezchip to continue to grow as an independent company if and when it is appropriate to sell the company they would help execute and oversee a comprehensive sale process that would ensure shareholder value is maximized   if elected these new board members would occupy just two of seven board seats but would be instrumental in their role as advocates for shareholders instituting appropriate governance oversight sustainable economic performance and longterm value creation  furthermore if elected these candidates will seek to work constructively with the other directors to

shareholders of ezchip and our interests are closely aligned with yours our objective is for the company to continue to prosper and grow independently and if the company is to be sold we would expect
