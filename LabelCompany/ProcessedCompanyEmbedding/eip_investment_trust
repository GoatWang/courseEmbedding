bdo branch for more details well i hope i win too personal finance champions bdo’s eip by randell tiongson on october th  how can an investment make it to my list of personal finance champions here’s why as a personal finance advocate i and many other advocates have been teaching people on the power of regularly saving and investing many of us will use charts and illustrations showing the power of compounding especially if we are doing it on monthly basis however there is hardly any vehicle for us to do such investment on a monthly or semimonthly basis if there is the minimum amounts required will marginalize many of us i have been writing and speaking about the advantages of pooled funds especially for long term investing please check my other blogs on pooled funds mutual funds and uitfs are good investment vehicles for the average pinoy and one can expect better capital growth in the long term for such instruments however mutual funds and uitfs have minimum amounts and although they are relatively low many pinoys still find it difficult to cough up the initial placement that ranges from p to p further many of us will start on investing on said pooled funds but will stop making additional placements because we find it inconvenient and we lack the discipline for force savings to learn more about pooled funds visit my previously posted articles pooled funds   pooled funds  when i received a call from bdo’s chief investment officer marvin fausto to have lunch he said that he has something that he wants to show me that i will definitely find interesting since marvin is a dear friend and one i respect and admire a lot i agreed to meet him provided he pays for lunch always a cheapskate i am mr fausto told me about a new product bdo will be launching a uitf program that can be deducted from one’s savings account on a monthly or semimonthly regimen it was interesting but i didn’t think it was really anything new… besides there are very few pinoys who can afford a monthly debit of p what marvin said after really caught my attention – he smiled and told me that the monthly deduction can be as low as p a month and the investor can chose among  funds bdo is offering bond balanced and equities my jaw dropped and asked him “really you guys are willing to let people buy into your funds for p wow” further the convenience of auto deduction will be good for many of us who are not necessarily well disciplined in savings  what i also like is that an investor just needs to go through the initial paperwork one time no further documents signatures know your client kyc questionnaires after here’s the beauty of the eip if i am a conservative investor i can opt to go for their bond funds which are generally low risk investments if i am aggressive and still have a lot of time before i need my funds i can opt to be a risk taker and invest in their equity funds if i want to be in the middle of the ground when it comes to taking risks i can opt for balanced funds while other banks can offer you uitf funds i don’t think there is anyone that will let you invest for a small amount of p per month finally there is a real product that is consistent with what we finance coaches teach regular savings and investing over a long period of time and this time even those with challenged incomes can now participate truly the bdo eip is a personal finance champion in my view pinoys should take advantage of investing through the eip and other financial institutions should take queue from bdo to marvin fausto ador abrogena marily de vera and the rest of the bdo trust department mabuhay kayo check out bdo’s eip on their website investing made easier with bdo’s eip by randell tiongson on september th  reposting jane uymatiao’s blog… in a previous post i wrote about having been invited to a workshop steps to financial peace given by randell tiongson a wellknown financial planning consultant as well as other inspirational speakers randell spoke of the philippines’ low savings rate –  in  – the lowest in asia if filipinos saved only  of their income it meant that so many are not saving or not saving enough in the workshop randell also mentioned that if all extra money is placed only in savings or time deposit it earns at a lower rate than inflation purchasing power then is being eroded by inflation as it cannot keep up with the higher inflation the only way to keep purchasing power ahead of inflation is to put one’s savings into higheryielding products trust products are the popular investment channels available now to most people problem is that while the minimum placements have gone down considerably to allow more people to invest in these it is still not low enough i remember a time when the minimum investment amount in unit investment trust funds uitf was around php  million that meant only the already rich could invest in these types of products everyone else had to be content with a savings or time deposit product over the years however the minimum trust investment started coming down to php then php and eventually as low as p a sponsor of the workshop happened to be banco de oro bdo during the workshop the executives of bdo’s trust department introduced a new trust product called easy investment plan or eip for only p a month you can already join the ranks of those who have access to higheryielding products briefly what are uitfs they are not deposit accounts rather they are trust agreements in the case of the eip bdo is the trustee tasked to make decisions as to how to invest the funds they earn a higher rate of return compared to deposit accounts but are not insured with the pdic or obligations guaranteed by a bank an investment is assigned a certain number of “units” depending on the unit value on the date you made the investment this unit value … read full post athttpjaneuymatiaocominvestingmadeeasierwithbdoseasyinvestmentplaneip search for i need help with my finances financial
