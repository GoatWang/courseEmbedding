operate in rural areas where having a quick response time to critical medical situations can save lives how can a membership be so inexpensive and yet still be able to cover the cost of a flight membership fees alone are not enough to cover the cost of member transports those fees are prepaid protection against costs not covered by a member’s insurance other benefits or third party responsibility almost all of our members have some type of insurance benefit or third party responsibility that covers all or part of the cost of transport collecting enough from those sources is necessary to keep membership fees low of course if there is no other source of payment for a member’s transport the transport is still covered in full by the membership when seconds count you can

to be transported membership offers several important benefits first as one of more than  million members airmedcare network providers will work on your behalf with your benefits provider to secure payment for your flight with any uncovered amounts considered to be fully prepaid as such members who are transported by airmedcare network will not receive a bill for the flight importantly your

able to cover the cost of a flight membership fees alone are not enough to cover the cost of member transports those fees are prepaid protection against costs not covered by a member’s insurance other benefits or third party responsibility almost all of our members have some type of insurance benefit or third party responsibility that covers all or part of the cost of transport collecting enough from those sources is necessary to keep membership fees low of course if there is no other source of payment for a member’s transport the transport is still covered in full by the membership when
