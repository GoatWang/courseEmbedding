sa the us candy market isnt so sweetthe swiss food giant is considering a sale of its us business that makes sugary treats including butterfinger crunch and laffytaffy but for americans thinking wait what is nestle without its chocolate  dont worry its keeping the iconic toll house cookies and their key ingredient chocolate morsels anemic growth in the us food industry has been fueling a great reshuffling of assets as the heavyweights study megamergers and opportunistically scoop up newer brands that show promise while parting with the laggards chocolates deliciousness hasnt shielded it from the broader industry slowdownthe projected compound annual growth rate for the next five years for both chocolate and sugar confectionery in north america is around  percent according to euromonitor international and nestles business specifically experienced a decline in the first three months of the year and has lost market share it only makes sense that its ready to move on from this market where margins trail its global average  still on top nestles stock has pulled ahead of its biggest packagedfood peers as the business benefits from pricing power and the ceo considers selling underperforming units source bloomberg the products also dont fit with nestles move toward healthier foods even though new ceo ulf mark schneider has said that theres no flagrant contradiction between chocolate and healthy eating wed all like to believe thats true but our waists know better it seems nestle is finally listening to my colleague andrea felsted who has written a series of smart columns including one suggesting that if schneider really wanted to keep the us chocolate business he should take a page out of rival lindt  sprungli ags playbook to spruce it up and if he werent ready to invest in it then its time to let the division go and stop being a drag on the company time to get creative as nestle looks for ways to boost sales and margins butterfinger and crunch bars are being put on the chopping block source bloomberg the candy industry in the us is dominated by hershey co and mars inc though any of the market leaders in this chart could take an interest chocolate factory whoever buys nestles us confectionery arm would instantly gain a significant presence in the nation that consumes more candy than any other country source euromonitor international mondelez international inc the snacks company that makes oreo and sour patch kids could bolster its candy offerings with nestles strong names while mondelez split from kraft foods with the intention of targeting fastergrowing international markets it made a failed run at hershey last year private equity firms may also have a sweet tooth right now their best shot of achieving targeted returns wont come from pursuing large leveraged buyouts of expensive companies instead theyre more likely to hit home runs by attempting to turn around poor performers and recharge their growth as such businesses often fall victim to underinvestment when trapped within a conglomerate such as nestle the us confectionery business generated revenue of about  million swiss francs in  which is about  million based on thursdays exchange rate food acquisitions can go anywhere from two times sales to more for big sustainable brands even if nestle could fetch  billion for the division thats perfectly digestible for buyout firms and it wouldnt be the first time private equity was there to pick up nestles unloved assets in  it sold most of its weightloss focused jenny craig brand to north castle partners its also sold a number of castoffs including juicy juice drinks and nutrament to brynwood partners and the companies that firm owns allamerican the us represents almost onefifth of the global confectionery market source euromonitor international and then theres the suitor one can never leave out g capital kraft heinz co which is controlled by g and run by the private equity firms partners is looking hard for its next acquisition while a deal for nestles candy business isnt on the scale of the transaction everyones expecting it still could be on kraft heinzs radar g would undoubtedly see a way to take out costs and boost profits beyond what nestle could do still it probably makes more sense for a company focused on this market to tack on these brands with a number of potential bidders nestle could well be rewarded for losing the weight  this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of bloomberg lp and its owners and although closelyheld mars could use this as an opportunity to extend its lead its pending  billion deal for animalhospital chain vca signals its focus is on building out its pet business where growth isnt quite as subdued as candy one buyer that may hold an advantage over others is european private equity firm cvc capital partners which acquired campbell soup cos european simple meals unit away from a competitive auction bertrand meunier a managing partner there has developed a respected track record among food companies having previously been involved in deals including carveouts from danone sa and campbell soup co and the buyout of united
