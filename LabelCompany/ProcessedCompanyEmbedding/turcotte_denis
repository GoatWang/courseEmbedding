execs  top ceo  top cfo  top cio  top in ops  most innovative  where are they now denis turcotte algoma steel inc tsx aga age   years at the company  denis turcotte was in danger of losing his job–along with  of his colleagues barely  years old and fresh out of business school in  turcotte was working as a maintenance superintendent for the spruce falls power and paper co in kapuskasing ont the mills owners kimberlyclark had been trying to sell the ailing facility for months without success the only option left was to slash the workforce down to  workers a move that would devastate the economy of the small town that depended on the mill the massive restructuring had just been announced to employees at a special meeting and turcotte was milling around with a few coworkers a secretary asked him “youve got all this business training cant we buy this company” while the other employees chuckled turcotte returned to his office and started making phone calls he got in touch with union representatives and soon convened a group that a little over a year later raised  million for an employee buyout of the mill in the end the buyout in partnership with quebec pulpandpaper company tembec saved the jobs of  employees along with kapuskasing that was just the first time turcotte proved instrumental in saving a company the second time came as president and ceo of algoma steel inc the company based in sault ste marie ont had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy twice within  years most recently in  “its been a bloodbath of an industry” says turcotte who took the top algoma job shortly after it emerged from bankruptcy protection in september  “this environment is not for the faint of heart” no kidding five years ago more than  other steel companies in north america had filed for bankruptcy protection and no one whod been watching algoma sink deeper into debt as steel prices plummeted could have been surprised when it followed suit but what has been surprising is algomas return to profitability sure most steel companies are swimming in cash these days thanks to strong demand and record prices in  more than us per net ton but algoma has far outperformed its peers it was the most efficient steel producer in the world last year earning us on every ton sold nearly twice as much as the no  company united states steel corp theres no question turcotte  has improved algomas standing by transforming it from a mismanaged hulk collapsing under its debt into a slim efficient producer — one that has rewarded shareholders with more than  million in cash distributions since  turcotte has also betterinsulated algoma from the inevitable shocks that will come from dips in the steel market the accomplishment is all the more remarkable given that turcotte was a steelindustry rookie and one whom algoma board member patrick lavelle refers to as “boy scout” for his optimism and touch of naiveté counters turcotte “i always tell him i want to remain conveniently naive because thats what drives people to do better and better and focus on achieving things that are ideal as opposed to compromising” he will certainly need to stay positive since some of algomas biggest challenges lie ahead — mainly what to do next china the biggest consumer of foreign steel in  is turning into a significant producer which could mean an influx of cheap steel to the market analysts say the current price of steel us per ton isnt sustainable but how much it will fall and when no one can say and with consolidation sweeping the industry canadas smallest integrated steelmaker cant remain a small player forever but the picture is much rosier now than it was five years ago algoma had already survived one bankruptcy scare in  and it emerged on shaky ground thanks to a million bailout package from the ontario government in the years that followed algoma embarked on a program to bulk up operations and took on a mountain of debt in the process the centrepiece of the strategy was a million stateoftheart mill which the company financed with longterm fixedrate us debt the mill called the direct strip production complex was completed in  but when the company flicked the switch things didnt work out as planned the dspc was plagued with bottlenecks and breakouts where liquid metal escapes from the machinery time and money was lost on repairs and output was far lower than the company estimated those issues combined with falling steel prices and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt forced algoma to declare bankruptcy once again dismissed by investors as a lost cause its stock plummeted to less than  per share into this bleak picture stepped turcotte turcotte grew up in thunder bay ont and says he comes from a “hardworking frenchcanadian” family his dad owned a trucking company and as a kid turcotte spent weekends at the garage changing tires and oil and generally getting dirty he developed an interest in all things mechanical and later pursued a mechanical engineering degree at lakehead university followed by an mba at the university of western ontario in london after the buyout of spruce falls turcotte rose through the ranks at tembec to become president of its paper group by the time he began interviewing with algoma in  the similarities between steel and forestry surprised him both are capital intensive commoditybased industries sensitive to market conditions nevertheless he spent the sixmonthlong interview process cramming about the steel industry his inexperience made some people uneasy “among the management group there was some skepticism what does this guy from the paper industry know about steel” recalls stephen boniferro algomas vicepresident of human resources “that didnt last long” turcottes outsider status allowed him a fresh perspective others looked at algoma and saw little hope of salvation turcotte saw opportunity he was particularly impressed by algomas  billion in assets as well as its production technology and capacity a lot of the companys problems were mechanical stemming from the failureprone dspc “i believe any technical problem can eventually be fixed if you get the right people focused in a tenacious way” he says the kinks in the dspc were finally smoothed out by  and it began producing at the levels for which it was designed that was no small victory but there remained that millionplus in debt along with the troubling fact that algoma was still a weak player in a market that was only just beginning to recover “probably the best luck we had was that things didnt turn around right away so we were forced to do the things we had to do” turcotte says one change was to reorganize the management structure which was illdefined and often had workers reporting to more than one senior employee “denis brought a focus to the organization that was missing” boniferro says turcotte implemented a companywide restructuring simplifying the chain of command and eliminating two layers of management between execs and the shop floor regrettably turcotte says there had to be layoffs about  employees were let go in  a hundred or so have been hired back but turcotte has also taken strides to cut costs without having to axe more jobs by enforcing a spirit of entrepreneurship on employees many ceos promote that line but few have been as successful as turcotte hes also the first to admit he cant take credit for the costsavings–a whopping  million since  “no one guy could have done what this company has done” he says “any ceo that postures that way is full of bs” during the time turcotte spent on the shop floor learning about the steel industry he came to recognize the experience and knowledge of algomas employees as an untapped resource he launched a plan to encourage them to suggest moneysaving ideas — no matter how small “you have to induce a culture where people value the input of the guys on the shop floor — who know more about running the business than anyone else” he says that kind of change takes time especially in a yearold company like algoma but as management began to act on some of the ideas employees became more confident in offering suggestions “no idea is a bad idea” turcotte says one of his favourite suggestions came from an operator who implemented a different method of making heattreat plate the operator talked with his foreman about reducing the time it took to heattreat each piece of steel after  months of trial and error they found a formula that worked resulting in the ability to produce an additional  tons of plate a year — nearly another  million in revenue for the company “so we ruined a few batches of plate” turcotte says of the testing process “but we need to try some creative things” given the number of costsaving suggestions turcotte expected to save  million within three years instead it took only two the savings and increased production from the dspc along with an improving steel market thanks to surging demand from china made  algomas most successful year ever with  million in profit last year wasnt bad either the company earned  million one of the most important things turcotte has been able to do with algomas newfound wealth is pay down nearly  million in debt putting the company in a much stronger position to weather steels ups and downs analysts are also impressed with his ability to handle cash hes opted to stockpile it spend it strategically or return it to shareholders instead of blowing it all on expansion — turcotte pulled out of the bidding for stelco in  for instance but not everyone has been impressed with turcottes fiscal management new yorkbased hedge fund paulson  co inc which held a  stake in algoma demanded more money from the company in october of last year the hedge funds founder john paulson wanted algoma to pay another  million to shareholders insisting it didnt need that much cash and could afford to go  million in debt to make the distribution paulson was also peeved that us shareholders incurred a  withholding tax on a previous special dividend payment of  million so adamant was paulson that he pushed for a shareholder vote that could have ousted turcotte and his colleagues from the board turcotte fought back after working hard to save money and pay down debt he wasnt about to jeopardize algoma with a payout it couldnt afford “i was put off at first because it was so irrational” turcotte says the issue dragged on until this march when turcotte met with paulson in new york the company had been planning a million share buyback at the end of the year and turcotte told paulson that was all he was going to get “he thought it was a negotiation but i said this is what we were going to do” paulson eventually acquiesced but he reduced his stake in algoma to  afterward the issue drew to a close late this september when algoma completed the share buyback despite the experience turcotte is far from being antihedge fund even though hes aware such similar strongarm tactics could be used again in fact he credits some hedge funds with bringing discipline to ceos and boards “ive heard too many ceos who only talk about what theyre doing in the longterm” he says “but you also have to focus on shortterm performance otherwise theres no constructive tension i think hedge funds bring a bit of that” as for algomas longterm prospects all of the companys successes lead to one thing for turcotte “now weve earned the right to start thinking strategically” the next phase for algoma is an important one it is better positioned than its been in a long time but dont expect turcotte to sit back and enjoy the good times “denis drives this home every day the minute you think youre ok youre in trouble” boniferro says the big question for algoma is how it will fit in with the global steel giants who are leading consolidation in the industry bmo nesbitt burns analyst randy cousins says its likely algoma will be bought up in the future possibly by a foreign company using it as a beachhead in the north american market cousins breaks steel companies into three categories global players productspecific mills canadas ipsco for example is a dominant producer of plate and niche mills like algoma “these are lowcost producers that focus on being where the market needs them to be” he says “but the key is you have to be quick” cousins says algomas slimmeddown workforce around  employees and greater production efficiency give it an edge and turcotte is looking at ways to further exploit algomas niche status soon after he started as ceo turcotte wanted to convene a meeting with algomas market development team but the meeting never happened — algoma didnt even have a market development team so turcotte created one it explores new products based on market needs and tries to identify new customers exploring joint ventures is another option — algoma recently entered into a partnership with germanys schaaf industries co to build a windtower manufacturing plant in the sault such proactive strategies mark a departure from the algoma of old which would discount its steel just to give itself a competitive edge making it the “whipping boy” of the industry according to one analyst as algoma continues to explore its role in the marketplace a more immediate issue is the negotiation of a new contract with the united steelworkers next year labour relations have never been easy in steel and with algoma in possession of more cash than ever before theres a possibility both sides could get greedy but turcotte will approach the issue with his typical boy scout optimism “the company will be reasonable and im expecting the employees will be reasonable” he says “i just gotta believe that people at algoma today are much happier than theyve been in years” algomas retreat from the brink january  an million debt sends algoma into bankruptcy protection ndp premier bob rae below claims

algoma with technical problems for years to come march  algomas debt stands at over  million amid production setbacks poor sales and low steel prices after “dumped” foreign steel floods the market april  algoma is forced to file for bankruptcy protection for the second time in a decade ceo alexander sandy adam tries to remain optimistic telling media “this is a restructuring not a bankruptcy” may  federal minister of industry brian tobin right says there will be no federal bailout package for algoma two weeks earlier ontario minister of economic development and trade bob runciman announced “were not fond of doing bob raes” hap stephen whose previous restructurings involved eatons and beatrice foods signs on as chief restructuring officer january  after nine extensions from the ontario

ceo adam tells media he feels secure in the ceo seat a few days later hes left off algomas new board of directors may  adam announces his retirement its the second highprofile departure from the company in a few months chairman robert milbourne left in march after only four weeks on the job december  high steel prices costcutting and a fully functioning dspc make  one of the most profitable
