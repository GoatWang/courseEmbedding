summary opening keynote arthur w coviello jr keynote summary friday april   by keith watson in general share facebook linkedin reddit twitter tuesday april   keynote summary by gaspar modelohoward the state of security arthur w coviello jr chairman rsa the security division of emc mr coviello opened his keynote with a quote from nicholas negroponte “internet is the most overhyped yet underestimated phenomenon in history” this statement mr coviello argues it is still true today and to determine the state of security one does not have to look beyond the state of the internet the growth of the internet has driven the evolution of computing in the last few decades computing has gone through radical transformations from its early days with mainframes to computers moving later to networks in the s and then to the rise of the internet and the world wide web in the mid s we are currently experiencing a confluence of technologies and trends cloud computing big data social media mobile consumerization of it that make clear that the next transformation of computing is well underway and creating new challenges to security coviello contended the past evolution of it infrastructure gives clear signals to the fast and deep changes security should continue to experience in the future as an example and in just a couple of years the it industry has moved from  exabyte of data to  zettabytes from the ipod to the ipad from m to over b internet users from speeds of kbps to mbps and from aol to facebook which would be the rd largest country in the world by considering its number of users as population coviello then used an interesting analogy to explain the impact in security of the continuous growth of the internet and therefore the need to better empower security imagine that the internet is a highway system that is experiencing an exponential growth in the number of cars that use it the highway system then needs to increase the number of lanes of existing roads add new roads and provide better ways for cars to access the system but all this growth also increases the number and complexity of accidents on the roads then security needs to grow accordingly to better manage prevent detect and respond the new scenario of potential accidents looking at the security world things have also changed dramatically over the years not long ago there were tens of thousands of viruses and their corresponding signatures where as now there are tens of millions organized crime and spying online is a very real threat today that was not really happening in  the scenario is then more difficult today for security practitioners to protect their networks stuxnet opened a new threat era for security we have long moved away from the times of script kiddies the new breed of attackers include  nonstate actors like terrorists and antiestablishment vigilantes  criminals that act like a technology company by expanding their market around the world to distribute their products and services and have sophisticated supply chains and  nationstate actors which are stealth and sophisticated difficult to detect wellresourced and efficient coviello briefly explained the high profiled breach experienced by rsa in  they were attacked by two advanced persistent threat apt groups from the steps taken it is very clear that a lot of research on the company was made before the attacks phishing email was used to get inside their networks sending the messages to a carefully selected group of rsa employees the messages included an excel attachment that contained a zeroday exploit adobe flash vulnerability which installed a backdoor when triggered the attackers knew what they wanted and went low and slow the attack went on for  weeks with rsa staying two to three hours behind the attackers’ moves the attackers were able to exfiltrate information from the networks but rsa ultimately determined that no loss was produced to the company from the attack as for the experience coviello acknowledged that is still not a good idea for a security company to get breached we are past the tipping point were physical and virtual worlds could be separated additionally the confluence of technologies and trends is creating more ‘open’ systems the security industry is challenged as the open systems are more difficult to secure than close systems each under a single domain we need to secure what in a way can’t be controlled it is then not difficult to explain what has happened recently in terms of breaches in  many highprofiled attacks occurred in what others have labeled as the ‘year of the security breach’ to big organizations like google sony rsa pbs bah booz allen hamilton diginotar and governmental entities such as the japanese parliament and the australian prime minister coviello argued that vendors and manufacturers must stop the linear approach used in the security industry to keep adding layer after layer of security control mechanisms security products should not be silos we need to educate computer users but keeping in mind that people make mistakes after all we are humans our mindset must change from playing defense as protection from perimeter does not work alone also security practitioners and technologists must show an ability for big picture thinking and having people skills we need to get leverage from all security products therefore the need to move away from the security silos architecture fortunately the age of big data is arriving to the security world coviello provided a definition to big data collecting datasets from numerous sources at a large scale and to produce actionable information from analyzing the datasets the security objective is then to reduce the window of vulnerabilities for all attacks the age of big data should also promote the sharing of information which unfortunately is currently a synonym for failure organizations do not work together to defend against attacks mr coviello calls for the creation of multisource intelligence products they must be riskbased as there are different types of risks and should consider the different vulnerabilities threats and impacts affecting each organization the intelligence products should be agile having deep visibility of the protected system they should detect anomalies in real time and the corresponding responses should be automated in order to scale and be deployed pervasively unfortunately today systems are a patchwork of security products focusing only on compliance finally the intelligence products should have contextual capabilities the ability to succeed against attacks depends on having the best available information not only security logs such information should come from numerous sources not only internals the qa session included several interesting questions after the stimulating talk the first one asked about the possible impediments to achieve the goals outlined in the talk coviello pointed out three potential roadblocks first the lack of awareness regarding the impact of a security situation by the top board of the organization top management should understand that security problems are the responsibility of the whole company not just the it department second ignoring the requirement to follow a risk based approach when making security decisions and developing strategies third is important that security programs grow as organizations increasingly rely on their it systems a question was made regarding the asymmetric threat that security practitioners face and what can be done about it coviello pointed out the need to work around risk analysis in order to reduce the potential risks faced by organizations it should be understood that the digital risk cannot be reduced any more than the physical risk so organizations should get more sophisticated on the analytics following a riskbased approach a member of the audience pointed out that several federal cybersecurity policies are based on the concept of defense in depth such concept is not driven by risks which ultimately might raise costs to organizations required to comply with policies and regulations coviello agreed that if a riskbased approach is not followed security programs might not achieve cost effectiveness he also mentioned that defense in depth is sometimes misunderstood as it is not a layering mechanism to implement cybersecurity it should encompass information sharing among organizations and even countries he offered an example calling for isps to play a more aggressive role and work with organizations to stop the threat from botnets a final question was made regarding the push by elected officials to use electronic voting especially in small counties that might lack the resources to protect those systems how to make elected officials understand the risk faced when using electronic voting when such authorities usually do not have the capability to secure the voting system coviello sounded less than enthusiastic about electronic voting but more importantly he said there is a need to aggregate the security expertise and services so it can be outsourced to small and mediumsized organizations the security industry should follow on the steps of the software and hardware industries offering outsourcing services and products tags for this post symposium leave a comment  so far »

google protocol friday april   by spaf in rd secure it practices share facebook linkedin reddit twitter this is posted on behalf of the three students listed below this is yet another example of bad results when speed takes precedence over doing things safely good work by the students spaf as a part of an insure project at purdue university phd information security student robert morton and seniors in computer science austin klasa and daniel sokoler conducted an observational study on google’s quic protocol quick udp internet connections pronounced quick the team found that quic leaked the length of the password potentially allowing eavesdroppers to bypass authentication in popular services like google mail or gmail the team named the vulnerability ringroad and is currently trying to quantify the potential damage during the initial stages of the research the purdue team found that the internet has been transformed over the last five years with a new suite of performance improving communication protocols such as spdy http and quic these new protocols are being rapidly adopted to increase the speed and performance of applications on the internet more than  of the top  million websites are already using some of these technologies including many of the  highest traffic sites while these new protocols have improved speed the purdue team focused on determining if any major security issues arose from using quic the team was astonished to find that googles quic protocol leaks the exact length of sensitive information when transmitted over the internet this could allow an eavesdropper to learn the exact length of someones password when signing into a website in part this negates the purpose of the underlying encryption which is designed to keep data confidential  including its length in practice the purdue team found quic leaks the exact length of passwords into commonly used services such as googles email or gmail the purdue team than created a proofof concept exploit to demonstrate the potential damage step   the team sniffed a target network to identify the password length from quic step   the team optimized a password dictionary to the identified password length step   the team automated an online attack to bypass authentication into gmail the purdue team believes the root cause of this problem came when google decided to use a particular encryption method in quic the advanced encryption standard galoiscounter mode aesgcm aesgcm is a mode of encryption often adopted for its speed and performance by default aesgcm cipher text is the same length as the original plaintext for short communications such as passwords exposing the length can be damaging when combined with other contextual clues to bypass authentication and therein lies the problemconclusion in summary there seems to be an inherent tradeoff between speed and security as new protocols emerge on the internet these new technologies should be thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities in a realworld environment google has been informed of this vulnerability and is currently working to identify a patch to protect their users as google works to create a fix we recommend users and system administrators to disable quic in chrome and their servers by visiting this link we also recommend  independent of this issue  that users consider enabling two step verification with their gmail accounts for added protection as described here the purdue team will be presenting their talk and proofofconcept exploit against gmail at the upcoming cerias

share facebook linkedin reddit twitter note update added march   has gotten off to a bad start for the security community…and to me personally first we lost kevin ziese i met kevin over two decades ago when he was involved in computer investigations with the air force i got involved with a couple of investigations as it was a new field and i had some connections with the air force at the time kevin later served as a un weapons inspector in iraq after the first gulf war he was at the pentagon on  he served in our military with distinction later he was involved with intrusion detection research and became one of the principals in wheelgroup which was acquired by cisco he had a significant career in cyber and made a number of seminal contributions to the field that most current practitioners have never heard about kevin was very creative and an able investigator but what i remember most about him was his incredible enthusiasm and sense of humor in all our interactions i can’t recall him being anything other than upbeat and with great insight i regularly crossed paths with him at ids and computer crime workshops and in activities for the air force he was also generous with his time and he found ways to visit purdue several times to give talks to my students i hadn’t seen kevin for a few years and was vaguely planning on visiting him in the next year or so we were overdue to catch up we had been keeping in touch electronically and his death was a huge — and sad — surprise to me kevin introduced me electronically to howard schmidt in the early s after howard joined afosi we exchanged email and phone calls for several years until we spoke on a conference panel together and finally met in person early on we discovered we were in sync on a number of things and continued to enjoy our correspondence and occasional meetings through his time at microsoft when he moved to his position at the white house the first time in  i visited several times to join in conversations on how to fix some of the cyber security problems of the country one time he hosted my family for a saturday morning breakfast in the west wing staff dining room and was so very kind to my young daughter — answering her questions with tremendous patience thereafter we continued to interact in his various roles and on through his time at the obama white house whenever i’d get to washington we’d get together for a conversation and sometimes a beer twice howard came to purdue to speak in our annual cerias security symposium each time he told me in confidence that he had decided to leave his position at the white house and his visit to me each time had cemented his decision thereafter i got a note from someone who worked with howard suggesting that i stop inviting critical personnel to speak at purdue i have so many stories about my times with howard and they are all good he was always supportive and positive and he was always trying to find a way to make things better for others he also never let his seniority and distinctions get in the way of helping others for instance i fondly recall when the ewf was starting its women of influence awards and they asked howard and me serve as judges for the first awards however to keep with the spirit of the awards and the restriction on judges we had to be declared as “honorary women” howard and i agreed even when told that we might need to show up at the awards in skirts and heels as part of the process we laughed about that in later years — that the reason the awards made it into subsequent years was because we weren’t asked to do that and we did view it as an honor the last time i saw howard was in late  when we both appeared on a panel at a meeting at a government agency for the last  years we kept up with occasional social media and email — sort of the reverse of how we met howard’s passing last month was untimely and a shock to any of us especially so close to kevin’s i attended howard’s funeral and memorial service last friday it was important to many of us to see off an old friend while there i got to spend time with one of my oldest and dearest friends becky bace the “den mother of cyber security” becky was an old friend of howard’s too having met him slightly before i did becky was also a friend of kevin i first met becky in  at one of the old now defunct national security conferences we immediately hit it off with discussion about mutual interests in security and crazy humor becky was the person who got me to move my primary research focus to security and provided funding for my first security research project in intrusion detection she involved me in the intrusion detection “guru” workshops she held and introduced me to others in the field — becky knew everybody it seemed over the course of the next  years becky and i became good friends and colleagues in a number of cybersec activities we served on boards and panels together we consulted for some of the same companies she also made sure to introduce some of my students to people working in the field both to help them enhance their research and to get researchers to learn about some of the cuttingedge things we were doing in the university we often called each other to share notes and occasionally gossip that we didn’t want to put in email becky regularly visited cerias to speak and mentor students she was especially helpful in mentoring some of our women students and faculty “infomom” was bright funny and incredibly networked i have so many stories about becky there was never a time together where we didn’t laugh about something…many things…but also develop some new insight or connection that one of us could use and every time we were together we were spinning ideas for how i could find something new to do to break out of the rut i’m often in at the university and for her to explore as a new career path i wanted to do more in the commercial world and she wanted to have an impact in the academic space becky and i both were quite devastated by howard’s passing and the funeral was both a very sad time and a chance to share more laughs with each other with stories about our times with howard thus it was all the more shock to learn less than  days after i last saw her that becky had died suddenly in the space of six weeks i have lost three friends and colleagues each of whom i have known for over two decades and one of whom was one of my closest friends time passes and we all have finite time here nonetheless it is always too soon for the people we care about and it is too soon to lose the people who have spent so much time and effort trying to make the world better for the rest of us it is also sobering that these three were people my age it reminds me that time is passing rather than some entity purposely making the stairs steeper for me each year it also reminds me of one of the reasons i have spent my career to date in higher education — it is one of the few vocations where there is some real hope of replacing ourselves and doing so with better quality than what we are ourselves but as much as we may try we will not see any like kevin howard and becky again to paraphrase a mutual friend if there is a heaven it is going to be much more secure and much more fun than it was before rip friends update march   kevin i have learned that some people had not yet heard of kevin’s passing although they knew him if you want to make a donation in his memory please send it to one or more of disabled american veterans air force memorial foundation howard if you wish to make a donation in the memory of howard schmidt send it to brain tumor research program ℅ dr connelly  w wisconsin ave milwaukee wi 6 becky there will be a memorial service for becky in shelby hall at the university of south alabama in mobile al on saturday march th at pm information on attending and travel are posted here a memorial webpage will be posted on becky’s infidelnet website sometime in the next week or so a memorial service will also be held in san jose on april  i will post additional details here if i get them acsas top scholarship in the scholarship

comment  so far » another surprise for spaf friday november   by spaf in general kudos opinions and rants share facebook linkedin reddit twitter  has been a year of setbacks and challenges for me including being ousted as executive director of cerias rather than dwell on those issues i have tried to stay focused on the future and move forward thankfully some good things have come along and the year is going to close out on several positive notes my last blog post noted recounted being informed that i am to receive the  ifip kristian beckman award as one such positive item today was the announcement of another pleasant surprise — i have been named as a sagamore of the wabash this is the most significant civilian award from the state of indiana the award is in recognition of three decades of leadership in cyber security and service to organizations in the state including my leadership at cerias work with local companies and support of government and law enforcement as noted in the purdue press releasei want to thank all the colleagues and students past and present who have worked with me over those many years what we have accomplished only occurred because of our collective efforts one individual can usually effect only a small amount of change it is as a group that we have had a tremendous impact it is gratifying to see their individual successes too — some of my most gratifying experiences have been when former students tell me that what i helped them to learn was an important component of their success some of my friends may be amused by an irony present in my now having two certificates on my office wall one signed by george w bush and one by mike pence but none from anyone in the clinton or obama administrations if you don’t understand that irony move along however irony is not new to me — i’ve repeatedly been recognized internationally for my research and leadership but actually penalized by some at the university — including within my own department — for those same activities i haven’t done any of what i do for recognition though my goal is to help ensure that the world is a better safer place as a result of my actions even if no one notices i will continue to do so for years i had a sign above my desk with a quote by mark twain always do right this will gratify some people and surprise the rest i no longer have the sign but i still live the words i also want to note as i have several times recently that as i get these “lifetime achievement” types of recognitions i don’t want people to think that the problems are solved or that i am planning on retiring far from it the problem space has gotten larger and more complex and the threats are more severe and imminent i certainly am not bored with what i do and i think i have some good experience and ideas to apply i’m not sure what i’ll do next or where but i don’t intend to step to the sidelines another of my favorite aphorisms was stated by archimedes give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and i will move the earth if i can find the resources offers and the right place to work suggestions i plan on continuing to move things a bit best wishes to you all

leave a comment  so far » passing of a cyber securty pioneer tuesday july   by spaf in general share facebook linkedin reddit twitter stephen t walker recently died he was the founder of the pioneering trusted information systems a prime force behind the establishment of the ncsc now the commericial solutions center but also the producer of the rainbow series and he was the recipient of the first national computer security systems award  his obituary lists his many notable accomplishments and awards steve was a major influencer and mentor in the field of cyber security for decades i only recall meeting steve once and i am poorer for not having had more contact with him if you work in cyber security you should read his obituary and ponder the contributions that have led to the current state of the field and how little we have credited people like steve with having had a lasting influence tags for this post leave a comment  so far » page  of  pages       last » recent posts
