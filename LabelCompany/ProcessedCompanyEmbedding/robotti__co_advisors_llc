asset management institutional research media career opportunities contact us value is the keystone of the robotti investment selection process   our research approach is through classic value investing as pioneered by benjamin graham robotti  company maintains a long term investment horizon in its securities selection  inherent in our approach is the belief that market prices of securities do not necessarily indicate their true economic worth  our analysts research and identify investments selling at significant discounts to their intrinsic value through our research process we seek to identify companies that provide the opportunity for substantial capital appreciation while maintaining a significant margin of safety   our investment niche is smalltomid capitalization equities of misunderstood neglected and outoffavor companies the majority of the stocks we buy for clients are or were underfollowed and underresearched by wall street by looking at the companies that have minimal sponsorship we are able to uncover original and compelling investment ideas while we do specialize in smaller companies we also seek opportunities within our core competencies and will consider larger companies when appropriate   we have followed this investment philosophy since our inception and are proud of the longterm performance results that we have realized for our clients
