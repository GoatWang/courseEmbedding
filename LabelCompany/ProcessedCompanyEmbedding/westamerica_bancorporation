westamerica bancorporation operates more than  branches in  california counties including marin napa and sonoma from a handful of small community banks in the early s operating under a bank holding company organization westamerica had expanded by the mids to a position as one of the largest networks of community banks serving northern california and as a market share leader in many of the local areas it served formed in  under the name of independent bankshares corporation the holding company consolidated three previously unaffiliated banks bank of marin bank of sonoma county and first national bank of mendocino county which was formerly known as first national bank of cloverdale the new structure began operations in  foundings of the constituent banks the three individual banks which formed the  holding company and many of the subsequent additions to the westamerica network are invested with their own community banking history many of these individual banks trace their roots to banks which were formed by local business people to provide specialty financing for the local community business base many of these california businessesoften involved in agriculturefaced problems securing loans from big city banks which had strong ties to the interests of their railroad customers the first national bank of mendocino county provided the holding company with its oldest bank charter dating to  the foster family of marin county was one of the original families instrumental in founding the mendocino bank which was formerly known as the first national bank of cloverdale the bank was founded to provide financing for the people involved in agricultural interests in the mendocino area where sheep ranching was a dominant industry the bank of marin county was formed by businessmen involved in the dairy business and other local merchants the bank of somona county served the western portion of the county where cattle ranchers and dairy farmers were the major economic players the bank was a major financier for the areas apple growers who produced the redandyellow skin gravenstein apples primarily used to make applesauce in the s prominent pear growers including the bucknell family were involved in creating the bank of lake county formerly called the bank of upper lake that bank expanded and branched as the local economy grew along the shores of clear lake vaca valley banks roots are linked to the gibson family and its local business interests in newspapers and publishing in solano county and the surrounding area westamerica chairman david l paynes grandfather luther gibson was chairman of vaca valley bank payne became involved in the newspaper and publishing side of the gibson family business in the late s and continued the family tradition in banking in the later part of the s though their origins are more recent other banks in the westamerica network also trace their history to the growth in their local communities napa valley bank was founded upon the expanding wine and tourism industries in the area in the s capitolbank in sacramento county and gold country bank in nevada county were fueled by the influx of retirees when that area in the western foothills of the sierra nevada mountain range became an attractive relocation spot for older citizens in the s acquisitions of the holding company during the s the parent company independent bancshares corporation followed a conservative acquisition policy which entailed purchasing community banks in a countybycounty steppingstone pattern in  the company acquired bank of lake county a california statechartered bank which operated in the county adjacent to where westamericas existing operations were located gold county bank in  and vaca valley bank in  were each purchased by exchanging shares of the company for the shares of the acquired banks these six banks were consolidated in mid into a single subsidiary bank first national bank of mendocino county which subsequently changed its name to westamerica bank the company recorded below industry average earnings and investment return benchmarks during the remainder of the s the companys performance during this time was impacted by stiff competition from larger banks and other financial institutions such as brokerage firms mutual funds and insurance firms as well as problem real estate loans the company became a target for takeover in the late s but successfully fought those moves and remained independent the s fueled by a series of acquisitions reorganizations and mergers the s ushered in a period of earnings growth and enhanced investment performance the companys asset base almost doubled in the period from the end of  to mid during the s the company operated in an economic environment marked by slow growth in the affluent markets it served and in a banking environment marked by consolidation among large banks at one end of the spectrum and community banks at the other end where westamerica positioned itself within this environment westamerica pursued a twopronged growth strategy by expanding existing bank operations and by acquiring other community banks the company purchased the  million assetbased john muir national bank in  the following year the company acquired napa valley bancorp a bank holding company with an asset base of  million and with banking operations in geographical markets in which westamerica competed the acquired bank holding company consisted of a number of subsidiaries napa valley bank suisun valley bank an  percent interest in bank of lake county and a  percent interest in sonoma valley bank westamerica also gained additional back office operations with the napa valley bancorp services subsidiary which provided data processing and other services to the network of acquired banks over the next  months westamerica melded and reorganized napa valleys operations and assets suisun valley was merged into westamerica bank the name of napa valley bancorp services was changed to community banker services corporation and the  percent interest in somona valley bank was sold and the proceeds were used to improve westamericas financial base through a series of financial transactions the company consolidated its mortgage banking operations into community banker services and purchased the remaining  percent interest in bank of lake county from outside investors the company next completed three significant acquisitions in  in january the company purchased the  million in assets held by pv financial which owned pv national bank capitolbank sacramento with its  million asset base was bought in june and north bay bancorp the parent of  million novato national bank was acquired the following month the bank also purchased two bank of america branches and opened a new branch in contra costa countys concord a market with strong demographics where no suitable acquisition opportunity was available the company stated in its  annual report in april  the napa valley bank subsidiary was merged into the westamerica subsidiary leaders and strategies in the s in a research report dated july   issued by the brokerage firm dain bosworth inc the author thatcher s thompson attributed the success of westamericas acquisition policy to three factors disciplined pricing cost control and high credit quality standards many wall street securities analysts credit david l payne for westamericas turnaround and successful strategy in the s payne assumed the position of chairman in  and of chief executive officer and president in  payne had been a director of the company since  and his grandfather had been chairman of the vaca valley bank in the s westamericas growth was marked by a renewed emphasis upon its roots in community banking with many of the banks in its network tracing their lineage to local businesses westamerica has continued to emphasize serving the local small business community the individual banks have attempted to retain their local identity and their local bank managers have been given the authority to tailor and price their products and services for the needs of the individual and small businesses in the local community in an official filing with the securities and exchange commission westamerica said its individual banks emphasized big bank resources with small bank resourcefulness westamericas bankers have maintained strong personal contacts with local small business clients thompsons july   report for dain bosworth recognized westamericas local bankers as a topnotch sales force westamericas harddriving bankers sell sell and then sell some more was the headline of a november   article in the america banker which described how the banks staffers toted pagers cellular phones and laptop computers when they called upon their existing and potential local small business customers the article noted that the meetthecustomer approach had helped westamerica achieve a position as a supercommunity bank which could effectively compete with california banking giants such as first interstate wells fargo and bankamerica corp the bank also has created niche products and services for its individual customers particularly affluent professionals and people over the age of  years payne described his strategy as working my niches and working them well in an article in the april   issue of the business journal for sacramento california we arent everything to everybody and we dont try to be payne told the publication one niche product which westamerica created was its vip banking service for the  percent of its customers who represent  percent of its profits another example of niche marketing was cited by a research report issued in june  by the minneapolisbased brokerage firm of piper jaffray and authored by steven r schroll that report noted that checking account packages for people  years and older provided westamerica with a deposit base which was much more stable less expensive and thus a much more desirable source of funding than the average individual account at other banks under paynes leadership westamerica also strengthened its financial foundation although labeled as a rich kid in an october   article in the american banker the articles author sam zuckerman wrote that payne had gained respect since becoming chairman in late  for tackling the problem of troubled loans to the construction industry within  months zuckerman described payne as one of the banking industrys rising stars and as an upandcoming banking executive in a january   article in the american banker the acquisitions of the s engineered under paynes stewardship received high marks from banking industry executives and observers westamerica avoided loan quality problems by focusing its acquisition targets among high quality banks payne hasnt been bottomfeeding buying problem banks for a good price he buys good banks said banking competitor harold giomi president of sunrise bank of california in roseville in the business journal article of april   the acquired banks were quickly integrated into westamericas organization a february   article in the american banker described how a team approach enabled westamerica to consolidate in just  days the operations of the acquired napa valley bancorp and noted that westamerica retained  percent of napa valleys existing business westamericas expense reduction campaign and strict cost control were cited in the dain bosworth july   research report as major factors which contributed to the banks improved earnings and return on investment in the s the ranks of personnel were kept to a minimum as evidenced by the less than one dozen employees working at the bank holding companys headquarters in the mids while company assets significantly expanded the total number of employees declined in the first half of the s decade branch efficiency and productivity were another area of cost control westamerica shut branches which did not meet profitability and growth benchmarks acquired and existing branches which overlapped were closed backoffice operations throughout the system also were consolidated westamericas plans for the last half of the  decade were addressed by payne in the april   business journal article payne stated our longerterm plan is to expand further in the sacramento market where the article noted economic growth is forecast to outpace the rate in the san francisco bay area and the northern california coastal regions according to some demographic economists payne provided a more detailed outline of westamericas future strategy in the  annual report payne reported that westamerica would pursue its growthbyacquisition strategy but promised to apply strict criteria including a profitability within six months standard for each acquisition he described the evolving shape of community banking and the products and services the customers want and need they want to be able to bank from home  hours a day and have access to welltrained representatives not prerecorded messages to deliver roundtheclock service with knowledgeable and responsive employees payne noted that technology is playing a larger role in this effort so that employees can answer customers needs more quickly whether to process a loan or deposit or to simply fulfill a service need befitting a network of community banks many of which were spawned by local business people payne noted that westamericas bankers embrace the entrepreneurial bent of their customers and thus operate within a sales and service culture that motivates and rewards performance westamericas bankers receive compensation linked to their achievement of performance goals from the number of outside calls each branch office must make each week to how quickly our bankers must respond to customer requests payne stated in the  annual report payne noted that westamerica would continue to adhere to stringent cost control by further streamlining our back office functions and reducing our cost structures such a blueprint for further growth at westamerica could be a doubleedged sword thompson at dain bosworth noted that while westamerica was well positioned to continue its growth by acquisition and internal cost control these strengths made westamerica an attractive takeover candidate thompson forecast acquisition of this company is certainly a possibility however as long as earnings continue to grow and small bank opportunities remain abundant we think it is more likely we will see westamerica in the ranks of the consolidators as opposed to the consolidated products and servicesedit this article contains content that is written like an advertisement please help improve it by
