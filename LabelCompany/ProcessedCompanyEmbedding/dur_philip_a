management northwestern university he believed marketing was an essential part of economics and saw demand as influenced not only by price but also by advertising sales promotions sales forces direct mail and various middlemen agents retailers wholesalers etc operating as sales and distribution channels philip kotler holds that the organizations marketing task is to determine the needs wants and interests of target markets and to achieve the desired results more effectively and efficiently than competitors in a way that preserves or enhances the consumers or societys wellbeing he links the profit motive to the satisfaction of consumer wants and societys wellbeing in order to market effectively kotler believes the marketing purpose of elevating consumer wellbeing has to be put at the heart of company strategy and be practiced by all managerscitation needed in  the financial times cited kotlers three major contributions to marketing and to management first he has done more than any other writer or scholar to promote the importance of marketing transforming it from a peripheral activity bolted on to the more important work of production second he continued a trend started by peter drucker shifting emphasis away from price and distribution to a greater focus on meeting customers needs and on the benefits received from a product or service third he has broadened the concept of marketing from mere selling to a more general process of communication and exchange and has shown how marketing can be extended and applied to charities arts organizations political parties and many other noncommercial situations kotler argued for broadening the field of marketing to cover not only commercial operations but also the operations of nonprofit organizations and government agencies he held that marketing can be applied not only to products services and experiences but also to causes ideas persons and places thus a museum needs the marketing skills of product price place and promotion the ps if it is to be successful in attracting visitors donors staff members and public support kotler and gerald zaltman created the field of social marketing which applies marketing theory to influence behavior change that would benefit consumers their peers and society as a whole kotler and sidney levy developed the idea of demarketing which organizations must employ to reduce overall or selective demand when demand is too high thus when water is in short supply the government needs to persuade various water consumers to reduce water usage so that enough water will be
