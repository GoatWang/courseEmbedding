enrollment in two prospective randomized placebo controlled studies focused on relieving knee pain  both studies measure the effect of using the proprietary fda cleared iovera° treatment to freeze the peripheral nerves which transmit pain in the knee  the iovera° treatment provides an immediate nerve block that is a nonsystemic nonnarcotic solution to blocking pain for an extended period of time  the iovera° treatment has been commercially available in the united states since march    the myo study evaluates postsurgical pain management for patients treated prior to undergoing a total knee replacement  patients were enrolled the enrollment target was reached six weeks early  the primary endpoint is cumulative opioid consumption at  weeks posttka surgery comparing the iovera° treatment

therapy via the iovera° treatment the effect on the nerve is transient providing pain relief until the nerve regenerates and its sensory function is fully restored this pain relief is achieved without

that dr halland medical and manhattan spine and pain have joined a growing number of cuttingedge medical facilities in the nation and become the first in the northeast to offer the iovera° system for the treatment of anterior and interior knee pain the iovera° system cleared by the fda to treat peripheral nerve pain utilizes its patented focused cold therapy™ delivery system to direct a controlled cold dosage via closedend probes to specific nerves for precise predictable drugfree pain relief   “the iovera° treatment provides my knee pain patients with a very effective natural option that provides relief precisely at their point of pain allowing them in many cases to avoid or reduce their need for systemic painkillers” said sudhir diwan md manhattan spine and pain “my patients are excited to have a minimallyinvasive drugfree treatment that enables them to walk out of my office painfree and stay that way for up to  months”   “patients are relieved when they realize that there is a minimallyinvasive nonsystemic option that can give them instant knee pain relief” said halland chen md of dr halland medical “there’s something familiar and comforting to patients about using the simple power of cold to eliminate pain and with iovera° we can now use cold in a very hightech precise way to block specific nerve signals temporarily”   frequent knee pain limits function and mobility and impairs quality of life for approximately  of adults peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system are temporarily stopped from signalling for a period of time followed by a restoration of function  results may vary per patient because peripheral nerve function is disrupted rather than destroyed the results are safe effective and temporary   “we are so pleased that these pain specialists have seen the unique value of the focused cold therapy delivery system for patients with knee pain” said jeff gold myoscience ceo “the iovera° treatment allows physicians to target a patient’s pain directly at the source by treating the specific peripheral nerves involved with a natural safe dose of cold that temporarily stops the nerves from signalling and delivers immediate pain relief”   the iovera° system delivers liquid nitrous oxide from a convenient and powerful handheld device to the closedend probes of the smart tip during treatment while this highly pressurized liquid travels from the handpiece to the smart tip it undergoes a phase change becoming very cold drawing in heat energy from the surrounding tissue and forming a precise zone of cold at the targeted nerve the gaseous nitrous oxide returns into the handpiece leaving nothing behind in the body this precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called wallerian degeneration
