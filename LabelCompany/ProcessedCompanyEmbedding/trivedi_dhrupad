tripwire executives are leaving the portland company including president gus malezis who is exiting after just  months in the top job his last day was friday and hes been replaced by a veteran executive from tripwires parent company belden tripwire sold for  million in december  to belden a publicly traded midwestern company that makes communications networking hardware the portland companys longtime chief executive jim johnson retired last summer the changes appear to indicate that tripwire is being more tightly integrated into belden as the portland company works to expand beyond its traditional market protecting commercial activity online and adds safeguards for industrial equipment too malezis joined tripwire in  when it acquired a san francisco network security company called ncircle he became tripwires vice president of sales immediately following that deal and belden promoted him to president after johnson retired malezis lives in canada and had been running the portland business from there gus i think wanted to be a ceo on his own being a president as a part of another company is just different said dwayne melancon tripwires chief technology officer tripwires new president is dhrupad trivedi who has been a belden executive since   for the past three years as president of industrial technology and cybersecurity trivedi was the belden executive who led the tripwire acquisition and melancon said having him in charge of the portland company will give the business added heft within belden trivedi lives in the bay area and wont be moving to portland melancon said but will be a regular visitor and he said plans call for keeping tripwires headquarters in oregon another top tripwire executive product management vice president rod murchison is also leaving the company melancon said he believes murchison is going to pursue another cybersecurity opportunity murchison also lives in california tripwire recorded  million in sales
