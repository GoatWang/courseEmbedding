specific dsdna quantification uvvisbased cdrop™ method vs picogreen® fluorescent assay precise quantification and normalization of isolated genomic dna is critical for advanced molecular testing in life science research and molecular diagnostics uvvis based quantification has long been the method of choice mainly because of its convenience however determining the dna concentration based on the absorbance at nm suffers from interference of components such as rna proteins and phenols alternative methods such as the picogreen® based quantit™ assay based on fluorescence enhancement upon binding with dsdna have been developed to address this issue view white paper  microvolume protein quantification using the dropsense droplet plate reader the measurement of protein concentration in aqueous samples is an important assay in biochemistry research and protein production facilities spectrophotometric protein quantification assays are commonly used methods to rapidly determine the concentration of a protein they utilize the direct uv absorbance of the protein at nm in combination with its extinction coefficient or an indirect dyebased methods like bca lowry and bradford assays view white paper  dropsense and its dropplates a versatile tool for nucleic acid and protein droplet quantification as the demand for molecular tests increases automated systems for biomolecule isolation and sample analysis are becoming popular these facilitate integration of the complete molecular test in a full automatic setup with liquid robots and barcoded sample tracking resulting in a significant higher throughput while minimizing tedious manual repetitive tasks the trinean technology is a unique combination of the dropsense droplet plate reader the well dropplate microfuidic consumables and the dropquant analytical software enabling direct quantification of small biomolecule samples in these high throughput automated workflow view white paper  droplet uvvis quantification of native proteins in biopharmaceutical processing biopharmaceuticals are mainly produced by microbial fermentation or in animal cell cultures as a consequence a cascade of procedures including purification and characterization are required throughout the processing chain to obtain the protein at the desired level of purity and potency within these processes quantification of the protein of interest is mandatory at critical steps to maintain confidence in the processing results and fidelity in the end product view white paper  quantification of histagged igg antibodies after imac nicolumn purification trinean introduces a new cdrop™ application suited for the quantification od of igg antibodies and derivatives like fab fragments during purification by imac nicolumns using imidazolecontaining buffers view white paper dyefree quantification of oragene®saliva dna extracts using the trinean dropsense® droplet reader and cdrop™ spectral analysis software saliva samples collected with oragene® selfcollection kits from dna genotek offer a noninvasive and proven method for accessing high quality and quantity dna for genomic testing and analysis proper quantification of the extracted dna is a critical step for most downstream applications trinean has developed a specific quantification protocol for dna from oragenesaliva samples using the dropsense® droplet reader and the cdrop™ spectral decomposition software a comparative analysis using a picogreen® fluorescent quantification assay shows a comparable specificity for dsdna quantification since the readout of  samples with the dropsense is performed in  minutes without any prior mixing or incubation this technology is a viable alternative to fluorescent quantification assays view white paper  maxwell® blood purification kit app and maxwell® lev blood dna kit app a spectral content profiling application on the cdrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of dna isolations from blood using the maxwell®  blood dna purification kit and the maxwell® lev blood dna kit in this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results view white paper  quantifying amplicons in nonpurified pcr reactions direct assessment of product yield the polymerase chain reaction pcr is a fundamental tool in molecular biology and clinical testing most genetic tests rely upon the power of pcr to enrich specific targetsequences prior to analysis analytical methods like sequencing are relatively expensive and labs want to minimize the resources spent on samples that dont meet the requirements of concentration and quality to deliver a reliable result view white paper  qiagen® ez tissue dna app a spectral content profiling application on the cdrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of dna isolations from cells using the qiagen® ez tissue dna kit in this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results view white paper  cdrop protocol for trizol rna extract quantification and content qc this cdrop protocol is developed for specific rna quantification of extracts from a variety of sample origins human animal plant using extraction kits based on the onestep extraction method using a guanidinium thiocyanatephenol chloroform reagentmix developed by chomczynski  commercial available variants include the trizol® kit invitrogen tri reagent® mrc rnazoltm mrc and rna stattm teltest view white paper allpurpose protein sample qc using a novel microvolume platform with spectral content profiling software accurate total protein quantitation of purified proteins cell lysates affinitycolumn fractions or other complex protein samples is crucial for robust biochemical testing during biopharmaceutical development as well as production as the presence of chemicals doesnt allow simple a protein quantification more laborintensive alternatives for quantification are used examples are the colorimetric bradford or bca assay which negate to a large extent the presence of contaminants but require multiple steps and show variation depending on the sample composition and time point of measuring within the ongoing reaction view white paper precise nucleic acid quantification using labonachip spectroscopy and the cdrop quantification algorithm precise quantification and quality control of isolated genomic dna is critical for the success of downstream applications such as nextgeneration sequencing traditionally two quantification methods have been used routinely  uvvis spectroscopy and  fluorescencebased assays ie picogreen that utilize dna intercalating agents view white paper sample processing for the uk biobank genotyping project a project was initiated in  to perform snp genotyping on all uk biobank participants the aim of the project which was to be completed within an  month timeframe was to generate high quality genotype data and to make these data available for researchers via the uk biobank showcase system this poster describes the sample processing workflow presents a comparison between the two quantification methods used in the project trinean dropsense®  and picogreen and provides a summary of the genotyping metrics for the approx first  samples analysed view white paper droplet uvvis quantification of
