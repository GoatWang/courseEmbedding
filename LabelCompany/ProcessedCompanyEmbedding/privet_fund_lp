nominates a slate of highly qualified directors to the board of frequency electronics believes the company is deeply undervalued and a reconstituted board is required to drive shareholder value creationquestions independence and succession plan of board with median age of  and average tenure of  yearsnominates slate of highly qualified candidates with directly relevant backgrounds for election at frequencys  annual meeting news provided by privet fund management llc jul    et share this article atlanta july   prnewswire  privet fund management llc together with its affiliates privet the largest shareholder of frequency electronics inc frequency or the company with ownership of just under  of the companys outstanding common shares today announced that it delivered a letter to the companys ceo and copied the board of directors the board  in the letter privet discusses its attempts at constructive interaction with company management and its frustration with the lack of any meaningful progress  privet states that despite frequencys development of mission critical products across many different client programs shareholders have experienced a sustained period of share price underperformance  privet also announced today that it submitted a letter to the company dated july   nominating four highlyqualified director candidates for election to the board at the companys  meeting  privet believes these candidates possess diverse skill sets directly relevant to frequencys business and will effectively represent shareholders to drive sustainable value creation at frequency  each director candidates bio is included at the end of the below letter  privet remains willing to pursue an open and constructive dialogue with management and the board regarding all aspects of the companys operations corporate governance and opportunities to create value for shareholders the full text of privets letter is shown below july   martin blochfrequency electronics charles lindbergh blvdmitchel field ny cc board of directors dear martin the purpose of this letter is to respond to your written communication to us following our most recent fairly unproductive series of discussions and to clearly articulate our view of the best path forward for the company and its shareholders  background privet fund lp together with its affiliates is the companys largest shareholder owning approximately  of the common stock of frequency electronics  we have been shareholders of the company for almost four years and believe that frequency is deeply undervalued by the market  during the course of our ownership we have conducted extensive diligence pertaining to the company its products its competitors and its end markets  this analysis has led us to conclude that frequency plays a critically important role for its customers across many different programs  while we have determined that the companys operations are inefficient and its capital discipline lacking we believe that significant opportunities exist to create meaningful value that are within the control of management and the board of directors we are not the only shareholders who have been unable to realize any appreciation on our investment  over nearly every conceivable measurement period frequencys stock price has underperformed its peer group and the overall market by a significant margin frequency electronics historical share price performance share price performance  year  year  year  year russell  index     dow jones select aerospace  defense index     frequency electronics     underperformance vs russell      underperformance vs dow aerospace index     recent history in may  news reports circulated stating that frequency was possibly in the midst of a sale process  in response to these speculations privet pursued and ultimately reached an agreement with the company that provided for the sharing of confidential information and board designation rights in exchange for a governance standstill for the  annual meeting  it was our hope that we would find it unnecessary to exercise our option to appoint someone to the board  however after closely observing and interacting with the company we are convinced that the incremental addition of just one board member is not sufficient for true value creation to occur at frequency    as no favorable transaction has taken place in the period following our agreement we have spent the past year observing firsthand the significant tangible opportunities for corporate value creation that have not been clearly explored or even more frustrating have been ignored in favor of a singular focus on sales opportunities that have yet to materialize  as one example the act of promoting the companys controller to replace the retiring cfo – while ignoring the multiple experienced financial professional candidates that we put forward – was an explicit endorsement of the status quo  additionally demanding onerous confidentiality and standstill agreements as a condition to engaging with us to see if there was a basis for a shareholder friendly transaction further entrenched the present state of affairs  we have great respect for your development and selling acumen but if frequency is going to succeed as a company – capable of delivering financial returns to its owners – rather than just a distinct product line we believe real changes must be made the path forward we have maintained our significant ownership stake in the company for multiple years for one reason we believe frequency is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to create value for shareholders that are within the control of management and the board of directors  as the companys largest shareholder we are highly incented to search for suitable solutions that can drive tangible value creation for shareholders  we often encounter small public companies with a longrunning disconnect between their market valuation and our estimate of intrinsic value  most of these companies believe they are managed better than they objectively are  if one were to give a qualified and wellincented management team a desirable product and enough time it would be reasonable to expect that company to grow in size and generate returns for shareholders  as a contrast in over  years of being public frequency has failed to grow into a larger company or generate any meaningful financial return  in fact the market currently values the entire enterprise at only  million – less than its tangible book value  this is a frustration that should be shared by all frequency stakeholders especially management and the board it is our belief that change is urgently needed on the frequency board  the company needs to drastically examine many facets of its business that we believe to be directly under the purview of the board of directors  further we have seen no evidence of any sort of leadership and governance succession plan– a fact that we have continually called to your attention over the course of our ownership we view this as a critical component of strategic planning for a founderled company still reliant on an admittedly spry yearold ceo reporting to a board with a median age of  and an average tenure of  years  we question the independence of many of these directors and believe that some directors may have formed relationships over this time period that may render them unable to review managerial decisions and performance objectively or critically assess a broad range of alternatives concurrent with this letter please find our notice of nomination for the election of four director candidates general lance lord ryan levenson james henderson and ben rosenzweig  we believe that each of these candidates brings a unique and relevant skillset that can drive shareholder value creation at frequency  we are committed to maintaining frequencys investments in mission critical components while simultaneously improving profitability by rigorously scrutinizing capital allocation decisions and taking decisive action where necessary  we remain confident in the strategic value of the company and believe that our candidates and involvement can bring about positive change  our nominees have substantial experience operating and investing in many large and complex businesses both within and outside the aerospace and defense sectors  given their experience we believe our nominees are exceptionally qualified to represent shareholders by participating directly in the assessment and oversight of the companys strategic plan  we also believe our nominees possess the expertise accountability and independence to help frequency maximize shareholder returns  while we are disappointed that despite our best efforts we have not been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with frequency we remain willing to continue engaging in discussions seeking a negotiated resolution  however we will not tolerate any maneuvers aimed at disenfranchising shareholders through delay or entrenchment  we are resolute in our belief that meaningful board change is necessary to drive improved operational performance and we are prepared to exercise our rights as owners of the company to achieve the qualified and independent oversight that shareholders deserve best regards

prnewswire  privet fund management llc together with its affiliates privet one of the largest shareholders of hardinge inc hardinge or the company nasdaq hdng with ownership of over  percent of the companys outstanding common shares today announced that it delivered a letter to the companys board of directors the board  in the letter privet outlines its significant concerns regarding the lack of accountability of management and the board following a sustained period of both operational and share price underperformance  under hardinges current leadership shareholder value continues to be destroyed through wasteful capital spending a bloated operational footprint entrenching governance practices and repeated financial underperformance  privet states that shareholders have lost confidence in the ability of company leadership and that an independent nationallyrecognized investment bank should be retained to evaluate strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value the full text of privets letter is shown below march   the board of directors hardinge inc one hardinge drive elmira ny  attn rick simons chairman and ceo dear rick and members of the board of directors the board privet fund management llc together with its affiliates privet is one of the largest shareholders of hardinge inc hardinge or the company owning approximately  of the companys outstanding shares we made our investment in hardinge because we believe the company is deeply undervalued by the market relative to the value of its assets and its competitive position within the machine tool industry  unfortunately despite persistent opportunities for the company to realize meaningful growth and profitability hardinge leadership has failed to create value for its shareholders over any reasonable time horizon  we believe that the companys shareholders have a right to demand accountability from the stewards of their capital  shareholders have been more than patient in giving management and the board repeated opportunities to demonstrate execution against communicated objectives  rather than taking decisive action to hold management accountable for years of empty promises and squandered capital spending the board has continued to plod along tacitly approving mediocrity while putting virtually no personal capital at risk regrettably it is too late for shareholders to believe any action or plan this board may devise in response to our concerns  at this point we believe that the only way shareholders will feel that their interests are being truly considered is for the board to immediately commence a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders a history of underperformance the board of directors and senior management team at hardinge have been in place for a considerable amount of time  chairmanceo rick simons has been at the company since  and has been a member of senior management since  of the six other directors four have been on the board for more than  years and three have been on the board for over  years  over this same period of time hardinge shareholders have suffered through a sustained period of material underperformance hardinge historical share price performance  share price performance   year  year  year since hdng ipo  russell  index     proxy peer group      machine tool peer group      hardinge     underperformance vs russell      underperformance vs proxy peer group     underperformance vs machine tool peer group     we believe the primary reasons for this persistent underperformance have been managements poor record of capital allocation coupled with an inability to deliver upon stated financial goals  with minimal senior leadership turnover during this period of substantial underperformance shareholders are left to conclude that the board is either incapable or unwilling to hold itself or management accountable poor track record of capital allocation in late  the board was confronted with a proposal from industrias romi sa romi to purchase the company for an allcash price of  per share  that offer was summarily dismissed without any meaningful engagement by the company or its advisors  even after romi made its offer public and requested an open dialogue the board still did not engage with romi or any other wellcapitalized competitor in the hopes of procuring an acceptable price for shareholders stating only that the romi offer was grossly inadequate and opportunistic the boards failure to get the most out of a potential acquirer by refusing to participate in discussions demonstrating the true value of the company ultimately led romi to bring its opening offer directly to hardinge shareholders  in spite of this romi raised its offer to  per share a  premium over the hardinge stock price when romi first approached hardinge yet we could find no evidence that the board engaged in a constructive dialogue  in its public communications management focused on highlighting previously enacted operational initiatives intended to increase the value of the company ostensibly to drive the share price well above the romi offer over a reasonable period of time   unfortunately neither these ambitious business goals nor the envisioned stock price appreciation have been achieved while the nominal and opportunity costs have been borne by shareholders using the may  romi tender offer of  as our commencement we estimate hardinge has spent  million in an attempt to grow the business through nonmaintenance rd acquisitions and new facility construction in the five years following romis  million offer for the company that  million represents  of the companys current market capitalization and  of the value offered to shareholders by romi

change vs romi offer mms  growth capital invested as a  of current market value  growth capital invested as a  of romi transaction valuation  while the previous analysis compares the absolute value of the company relative to the total amount reinvested in the business over the past five years wasteful capital spending has coincided with roughly  shareholder dilution  examining the share price the only metric that really matters confirms that shareholders would have been better served by accepting the romi offer and then redeploying those proceeds into nearly any other financial instrument

although the companys filings did not disclose the internal forecasts and valuation metrics used by the board and its financial advisor in concluding to reject the romi offer subsequent performance has led us to surmise that management is responsible for either preparing deeply flawed operating projections or failing to execute upon reasonable ones  no accountability for failed financial commitments the  vision first presented to shareholders during the third quarter  earnings call outlines ambitious goals  million revenue and  million of ebitda which if achieved should certainly create tremendous value for shareholders  our enthusiasm for the prosperous future is tempered by the repeated failure of current leadership to achieve publicly stated objectives in the april  presentation in response to the romi offer management outlined a series of  performance results which hardinge would be able to achieve during any recovery due to key longterm value drivers and the actions taken during  and  to reduce costs  these future results were presented to shareholders as a fait accompli and served as a significant component in the public basis for the rejection of the romi offer  we outline the individual performance goals and the subsequent actual outcomes below goal company believes  –  incremental ebitda margin improvement as compared with prior recovery periods is attainable at higher sales volumes outcome          sales s          ebitda margin           and  certainly represent a strong recovery period for the machine tool industry looking back at the  margins achieved during  and  shareholders should have expected a minimum of  margins yet only saw  and  these results give us little confidence in the  vision promise of ebitda margins of  goal gross margins exceeding  outcome          gross margin          gross margins never reached the  threshhold for any year only approaching the target once goal lower sga as percentage of sales outcome          sga as  of sales          hardinge temporarily achieved this goal posting sga margins of  and  in  and  one to two points below prerecession runrates however we remain concerned about the transitory nature of this achievement as absolute levels of sga continue to steadily increase irrespective of the total amount of sales implicit goal  grow revenue at a greater rate than the industry outcome revenue growth underperformance vs industry peers yearoveryear revenue growth      hardinge revenue growth       machine tool peer group revenue growth       underperformance      there is no question that hardinge operates within a cyclical industry and that  was a business cycle trough  since that time the company has failed to effectively capitalize on the industry recovery while its peers have demonstrated consistent growth unfortunately the lack of accountability has not been confined to the results of the existing business  the company acquired usach technologies for  million in december  in a transaction that management hailed as an excellent extension of hardinges existing grinding machine product lines and noted the potential for significant marketing synergies for the usach brands by leveraging hardinges existing channels in asia… and into europe  since then it is our understanding that the subsidiary has generated minimal returns outside of the ebitda  million in  embedded in the substantial backlog at the time of acquisition and that usachs elgin il facility remains one of the least utilized facilities in the companys substantial footprint  on top of the minimal incremental earnings power and redundant facility hardinge has taken cumulative impairments on this acquisition of  million approximately half of the total purchase price bloated operational footprint hardinge operates ten separate manufacturing facilities encompassing more than  million total square feet while management is keen to emphasize the benefits of a globally diverse sales and manufacturing platform there has been little mention of the detrimental financial impact of operating several significantly underutilized manufacturing facilities over extended periods of time this inefficient operating model appears to be a meaningful reason sga expenses have risen from the  million per quarter estimate given in the april  management presentation to the  million per quarter guidance given in managements most recent earnings call  we find these numbers to be disappointing in light of the numerous opportunities management has had to recognize cost savings as a result of the companys acquisitions  anecdotally it appears that hardinge has yet to close a facility it has acquired as part of a larger transaction during the past decade  this does not seem to be a prudent strategy for maximizing the value of complementary businesses especially as the companys headquarters facility in elmira ny a structure capable of housing more than eight football fields continues to operate at a fraction of its overall capacity based on the midpoint of managements statement that the current facility footprint has a capacity of  million of annual revenue the company would need to increase its sales by a staggering  in order to grow into its current facilities  we find it highly implausible that operating out of a facility footprint that will at a minimum be significantly underutilized for the next six years even under the most aggressive assumptions is the optimal path to drive returns for shareholders  misalignment of interests shareholder unfriendly governance and lack of insider ownership despite the companys inability to create value for shareholders hardinges classified board and shareholder unfriendly corporate bylaws have helped to ensure that management and directors remain entrenched in their roles  the ability of shareholders to influence the governance of their company is obstructed by the prohibition of the rights of shareholders to call special meetings or act by written consent  further if shareholders were to attempt to obtain these rights they would face an excessively high supermajority vote requirement in order to amend the companys bylaws  these artificial and antiquated restrictions limit the boards accountability to shareholders and have created a culture of complacency that has permeated the ranks of management we are also very concerned by the lack of stock ownership by management and the board in light of their collective tenure  collectively the  company insiders own  of the outstanding shares however upon further examination it appears that an overwhelming portion of the reported insider ownership has been granted by the company  we went back to  and analyzed every stock grant for both directors and executive officers in order to determine the true method of ownership of hardinge shares  it appears that a majority of directors and officers have either not purchased shares in the open market or have actually been net sellers in recent years  in fact the only open market purchases from current management and directors we observed over the past decade were mr quains acquisition of  shares in  and mr hunters acquisition of  shares in   the vast majority of the reported ownership of insiders has come in the form of share grants rather than open market purchases  we believe that entrenched leadership coupled with minimal insider ownership and recurring stock grants has only served to widen the divide between the interests of the companys operators and its true owners why should shareholders trust that the  vision which would be expected to result in a   share price by  will be achieved when the managers and directors who set those very goals neither own significant amounts of hardinge stock nor are willing to commit their own capital to purchase more  in light of the foregoing it is clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable  the current board and management team have proven unworthy stewards of shareholder capital  it is time for the board to retain the services of a nationally recognized investment bank to conduct a fulsome evaluation of the companys strategic alternatives  this evaluation should be done objectively weighing the certain premium value shareholders would receive if hardinge was purchased by a third party against the future prospects of the company in the hands of a capable properlyincented board and management team  there is no other option — certainly not one that maintains the untenable state of repeated operational underperformance and continuous value transfer from shareholders to insiders  should the board fail to uphold its fiduciary duties we will seek to advance the interests of the owners of the company by pursuing direct shareholder representation on the hardinge board best regards ryan levenson and ben rosenzweig privet fund management llc   mr simons left the company in july  and returned in march

fund lp nominates a slate of highly qualified directors to the board of frequency electronics believes the company is deeply undervalued and a reconstituted board is required to drive shareholder value creation questions independence and succession plan of board with median age of  and average tenure of  years nominates slate of highly qualified candidates with directly relevant backgrounds for election at frequencys  annual meeting jul   pm edt atlanta july   prnewswire  privet fund management llc together with its affiliates privet the largest shareholder of frequency electronics inc frequency or the company with ownership of just under  of the companys outstanding common shares today announced that it delivered a letter to the companys ceo and copied the board of directors the board  in the letter privet discusses its attempts at constructive interaction with company management and its frustration with the lack of any meaningful progress  privet states that despite frequencys development of mission critical products across many different client programs shareholders have experienced a sustained period of share price underperformance  privet also announced today that it submitted a letter to the company dated july   nominating four highlyqualified director candidates for election to the board at the companys  meeting  privet believes these candidates possess diverse skill sets directly relevant to frequencys business and will effectively represent shareholders to drive sustainable value creation at frequency  each director candidates bio is included at the end of the below letter  privet remains willing to pursue an open and constructive dialogue with management and the board regarding all aspects of the companys operations corporate governance and opportunities to create value for shareholders the full text of privets letter is shown below july   martin blochfrequency electronics charles lindbergh blvdmitchel field ny cc board of directors dear martin the purpose of this letter is to respond to your written communication to us following our most recent fairly unproductive series of discussions and to clearly articulate our view of the best path forward for the company and its shareholders  background privet fund lp together with its affiliates is the companys largest shareholder owning approximately  of the common stock of frequency electronics  we have been shareholders of the company for almost four years and believe that frequency is deeply undervalued by the market  during the course of our ownership we have conducted extensive diligence pertaining to the company its products its competitors and its end markets  this analysis has led us to conclude that frequency plays a critically important role for its customers across many different programs  while we have determined that the companys operations are inefficient and its capital discipline lacking we believe that significant opportunities exist to create meaningful value that are within the control of management and the board of directors we are not the only shareholders who have been unable to realize any appreciation on our investment  over nearly every conceivable measurement period frequencys stock price has underperformed its peer group and the overall market by a significant margin frequency electronics historical share price performance share price performance  year  year  year  year russell  index     dow jones select aerospace  defense index     frequency electronics     underperformance vs russell      underperformance vs dow aerospace index     recent history in may  news reports circulated stating that frequency was possibly in the midst of a sale process  in response to these speculations privet pursued and ultimately reached an agreement with the company that provided for the sharing of confidential information and board designation rights in exchange for a governance standstill for the  annual meeting  it was our hope that we would find it unnecessary to exercise our option to appoint someone to the board  however after closely observing and interacting with the company we are convinced that the incremental addition of just one board member is not sufficient for true value creation to occur at frequency    as no favorable transaction has taken place in the period following our agreement we have spent the past year observing firsthand the significant tangible opportunities for corporate value creation that have not been clearly explored or even more frustrating have been ignored in favor of a singular focus on sales opportunities that have yet to materialize  as one example the act of promoting the companys controller to replace the retiring cfo – while ignoring the multiple experienced financial professional candidates that we put forward – was an explicit endorsement of the status quo  additionally demanding onerous confidentiality and standstill agreements as a condition to engaging with us to see if there was a basis for a shareholder friendly transaction further entrenched the present state of affairs  we have great respect for your development and selling acumen but if frequency is going to succeed as a company – capable of delivering financial returns to its owners – rather than just a distinct product line we believe real changes must be made the path forward we have maintained our significant ownership stake in the company for multiple years for one reason we believe frequency is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to create value for shareholders that are within the control of management and the board of directors  as the companys largest shareholder we are highly incented to search for suitable solutions that can drive tangible value creation for shareholders  we often encounter small public companies with a longrunning disconnect between their market valuation and our estimate of intrinsic value  most of these companies believe they are managed better than they objectively are  if one were to give a qualified and wellincented management team a desirable product and enough time it would be reasonable to expect that company to grow in size and generate returns for shareholders  as a contrast in over  years of being public frequency has failed to grow into a larger company or generate any meaningful financial return  in fact the market currently values the entire enterprise at only  million – less than its tangible book value  this is a frustration that should be shared by all frequency stakeholders especially management and the board it is our belief that change is urgently needed on the frequency board  the company needs to drastically examine many facets of its business that we believe to be directly under the purview of the board of directors  further we have seen no evidence of any sort of leadership and governance succession plan– a fact that we have continually called to your attention over the course of our ownership we view this as a critical component of strategic planning for a founderled company still reliant on an admittedly spry yearold ceo reporting to a board with a median age of  and an average tenure of  years  we question the independence of many of these directors and believe that some directors may have formed relationships over this time period that may render them unable to review managerial decisions and performance objectively or critically assess a broad range of alternatives concurrent with this letter please find our notice of nomination for the election of four director candidates general lance lord ryan levenson james henderson and ben rosenzweig  we believe that each of these candidates brings a unique and relevant skillset that can drive shareholder value creation at frequency  we are committed to maintaining frequencys investments in mission critical components while simultaneously improving profitability by rigorously scrutinizing capital allocation decisions and taking decisive action where necessary  we remain confident in the strategic value of the company and believe that our candidates and involvement can bring about positive change  our nominees have substantial experience operating and investing in many large and complex businesses both within and outside the aerospace and defense sectors  given their experience we believe our nominees are exceptionally qualified to represent shareholders by participating directly in the assessment and oversight of the companys strategic plan  we also believe our nominees possess the expertise accountability and independence to help frequency maximize shareholder returns  while we are disappointed that despite our best efforts we have not been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with frequency we remain willing to continue engaging in discussions seeking a negotiated resolution  however we will not tolerate any maneuvers aimed at disenfranchising shareholders through delay or entrenchment  we are resolute in our belief that meaningful board change is necessary to drive improved operational performance and we are prepared to exercise our rights as owners of the company to achieve the qualified and independent oversight that shareholders deserve best regards ryan levenson and ben rosenzweigprivet fund management llc
