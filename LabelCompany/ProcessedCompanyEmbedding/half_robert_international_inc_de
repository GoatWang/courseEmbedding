outstanding shares is  billion moving averages indicator signals trend direction of robert half international inc rhi traders will often use multiple moving averages to analyze a single security moving averages are a very simple tool to use like most technical indicators different traders will focus on different ways to use them a longerterm moving average may be used to identify the primary price trend a shorter moving average period to identify the secondary price trend and an even shorter moving average period to identify the minor price trend typically day simple moving average is useful at identifying swing trading trends lasting  days shorter moving average timeframes are more sensitive to price fluctuations and can pick up on trend changes more quickly than longerterm moving averages however these more frequent signals may also result in more “whipsaws” resulting in erroneous trade signals robert half international inc rhi recently closed with fall of  to its day simple moving average this short time frame picture represents a downward movement of current price over average price of last  days now moving toward intermediate time frame day moving average is more useful at showing position trading trends lasting  days shares of rhi moved downward with change of  to its day moving average this falling movement shows negative prices direction over last  days finally observing long term time frame day simple moving average is more helpful at telling general investing trends lasting  days longer moving average timeframes are less sensitive to price fluctuations than shorter term timeframes and will generate far few signals this will reduce the number of “whipsaws” which is good but will also generate signals later than when using shorter term
