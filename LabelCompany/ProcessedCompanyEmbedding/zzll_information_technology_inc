generally accepted in the united states of america management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year  these accounts and estimates include but are not limited to the valuation of accounts receivable deferred income taxes and the estimation on useful lives of plant and equipment  actual results could differ from those estimates concentrations of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the group to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable  in respect of accounts receivable the group extends credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral or other security  in order to minimize the credit risk the management of the group has delegated a team responsibility for determination of credit limits credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that followup action is taken to recover overdue debts  further the group reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at each balance sheet date to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts  in this regard the directors of the group consider that the groups credit risk is significantly reduced     cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include all cash deposits in banks and other highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less     accounts receivable   accounts receivable are stated at original amount less allowance made for doubtful receivables if any based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year end  an allowance is also made when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to original terms of receivables  bad debts are written off when identified  the group extends unsecured credit to customers in the normal course of business and believes all accounts receivable in excess of the allowances for doubtful receivables to be fully collectible  the group does not accrue interest on trade accounts receivable the group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis credit evaluations are preferred on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount  the group had experienced the bad debts of nil and nil during the year ended december   and  respectively   plant and equipment   plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use  maintenance repairs and betterments including replacement of minor items are charged to expense major additions to physical properties are capitalized   depreciation of plant and equipment is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates             furniture and fixtures          office equipment        property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of

group recognizes revenue when it is earned and realizable based on the following criteria persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured   the group also evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net basis through application of emerging issues task force no eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the consensus of this literature is that the presentation of revenue as the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or the net amount retained that is the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier because it has earned a commission or fee is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances in making an evaluation of this issue some of the factors that should be considered are whether the group is the primary obligor in the arrangement strong indicator whether it has general inventory risk before customer order is placed or upon customer return strong indicator and whether we have latitude in establishing price the guidance clearly indicates that the evaluations of these factors which at times can be contradictory are subject to significant judgment and subjectivity if the conclusion drawn is that the group performs as an agent or a broker without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods revenue should be reported on a net basis   advertising expenses   advertising expenses are charged to expense as incurred the advertising expenses incurred for the year ended december   and  were nil and  respectively     income taxes   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   the fasb issued accounting standard codification topic  asc  income taxes asc  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions this requires that an entity recognized in

measurement date asc  also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   level   observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   level   unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions   asc  also provides guidance for determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active and for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate when a transaction is not orderly   the effective date for certain aspects of asc  was deferred and is currently being evaluated by the group areas impacted by the deferral relate to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value but are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis the effects of these remaining aspects of asc  are to be applied by the group to fair value measurements prospectively

revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin selling inventoried products these conditions raise substantial doubt as to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   management’s plans to support the company in operation and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation  if we do not raise all of the money we need from a public offering we will have to find alternative sources such as a private placement of securities or loans from

stated in us dollars     summary of significant accounting policies continued     use of estimates   the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   concentrations of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the group to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable in respect of accounts receivable the group extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral or other security in order to minimize the credit risk the management of the group has delegated a team responsibility for determination of credit limits credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that followup action is taken to recover overdue debts further the group reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at each balance sheet date to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts in this regard the directors of the group consider that the group’s credit risk is significantly reduced   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include all cash deposits in banks and other highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less   revenue recognition   the group recognizes revenue when it is earned and realizable based on the following criteria persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured   the group also evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net basis through application of emerging issues task force no “eitf”   reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the consensus of this literature is that the presentation of revenue as “the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or the net amount retained that is the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier because it has earned a commission or fee” is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances in making an evaluation of this issue some of the factors that should be considered are whether the group is the primary obligor in the arrangement strong indicator whether it has general inventory risk before customer  order is placed under or upon customer returnstrong indicator and whether we have latitude in establishing price the guidance clearly indicates that the evaluations of these factors which at times can be contradictory are subject to significant judgment and subjectivity if the conclusion drawn is that the group performs as an agent or a broker without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods revenue should be reported on a net basis   on april   the board of director resolved to pay an officer for a monthly service fee of us the fee was raised to us per month as at october   the company has an option to pay the
