terwilliger  paulson investment company operator good day and welcome to the milestone scientific yearend  investor conference call today’s conference is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to david waldman please go ahead sir david waldman good afternoon and thank you for joining milestone scientific fullyear  financial results conference call on the call with us today are leonard osser ceo and joseph dagostino chief financial officer and chief operating officer the company issued a press release this morning monday april  containing fullyear  financial results which is also posted on the companys website if you have any questions after the call or would like any additional information about the company please contact crescendo communications at  the company’s management will now provide prepared remarks reviewing the financial and operational results for the fullyear ended december   before we get started we would like to remind everyone that during this conference call we may make forwardlooking statements regarding timing and financial impact of milestone’s ability to implement its business plan expected revenues and future success these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are based upon assumptions involving judgments with respect to future economic competitive and market conditions and future business decisions all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond milestone’s control some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forwardlooking statements are general economic conditions failure to achieve expected revenue growth changes in our operating expenses adverse patent rulings fda or legal developments competitive pressures changes in customer and market requirements and standards and the risk factors detailed from timetotime in milestone’s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation milestone’s report on formk for the year ended december   the forwardlooking statements made during this call are based upon management’s reasonable belief as of today’s date april   milestone undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly update any forwardlooking statements for any reason with that we’ll now turn the call over to leonard osser ceo please go ahead len leonard osser good morning thank you david and thanks to everyone who is joining us today good afternoon rather i’m pleased to report that revenue for the full year increased  to  million compared to  million last year our revenues would have been a bit higher however we deferred over  million in sales due to a delayed payment in the fourth quarter which we expect to record in  we attribute our continued growth to the success we have had in china where we are establishing a broad distribution network across the country to milestone china a joint venture distribution company between milestone scientific and a team of senior healthcare executives from china we anticipate milestone china will continue to help drive our dental instrument and handpiece sales in the months and years ahead we also achieved our growth in  despite the fact that we transitioned away from our former distributor in the united states and canada to henry schein who is now our exclusive distributor in the us and canada although this transition had a temporary impact on our domestic sales we believe it sets the stage for longterm sustainable growth henry schein is the worlds largest provider of healthcare products and services to dentists in north america importantly henry schein has completed the training of its exclusive product sales specialist on the wand sta system and we have begun to see the results of these initiatives we also continued to expand our distribution partnerships globally and have made considerable progress in developing a global key opinion leader network importantly our dental division continues to generate positive cash flow on a standalone basis which has helped offset our cash needs for the medical side of the business which we believe represents the greatest growth opportunity for our company turning to our medical instruments  was an important year as milestone began the transition of our medical subsidiary from a product development company to our current focus on commercialization pending fda marketing clearance we have completed the clinical trials for our epidural instrument in the united states and have submitted our k application for marketing clearance with the fda it is worth noting that we have incurred substantial course related to this trial in  although we could have conducted a smaller less costly trial we deliberately scaled up these studies to not only support our submission to the fda but also help us to build our key opinion leader network worldwide and support our worldwide marketing initiatives the clinical trial for the epidural instrument reached an enrollment of  patients and consisted of two separate arms pain management and labor and delivery both arms were compared against the current medical standards of care we believe we are on track to receive regulatory marketing clearance in the us for our epidural instrument in the first half of  in advance of marketing clearance we have initiated relationships with both distributors and key opinion leaders outside of the united states naturally predicting fda clearance is guesswork and not scientific as an example we have continued our collaboration with key opinion leaders in italy with the focus on expanding utilization of our instrument at key hospitals in rome florence naples and pissarro where the respective kols have been supportive and clearly recognized the advantages of our technology last month we successfully began the clinical rollout of our epidural instrument in the mena regions that’s middle east and north africa by initiating clinical evaluations at five hospitals in the united arab emirates and in lebanon in fact a number of key opinion leaders in the middle east north africa and italy have expressed further interest in broadening the scope into challenging their epidural procedures as well as extending its use into pediatric cases these are both areas where it is very difficult to do epidurals the results are not as clear as lumbar epidurals and quite a bit more problematic with considerable more morbidity considerably higher morbidity and failure rates and thats with the traditional use of the hypodermic syringe the epidural instrument and disposable kit has been introduced to approximately  anesthesiologists from the united arab emirates at two product launch meetings during the pan arab congress of anesthesia we also launched the epidural instrument and disposable kit in lebanon with our distributor and received the required authorized representative license approval by the saudi food and drug authority in order to import and commercialize the epidural instrument in saudi arabia we also signed additional distribution agreements in egypt and kuwait as part of our middle east product launch strategy we are now in the process of resubmitting our application to the fda for our intraarticular instrument and we are confident that the human factor study as well as the fact that our dental instrument has been used successfully in over  million injections todate will help us to obtain approval given our clinical and regulatory progress it was important to bring in additional resources to the senior management team as we enter the commercial phase of our growth on the medical side of the business in  we announced the appointments of james mcavinn as senior vice president of sales and marketing and ausra burniene as senior sales and marketing consultant both of these executives bring extensive industry knowledge and relationships that should allow us to establish worldwide distribution networks for our medical instruments i would add that they have been most impressive since joining the club we have completed a pilot study of our compuflo instrument at cornell university college of veterinary medicine the control pilot study of ten animals confirmed that our instrument can identify a target with a high level of accuracy when performing a maxillary foramen block in a horse at this point id like to turn the call over to our chief financial officer joseph dagostino to go over the numbers in detail but i will be back at the conclusion of joseph’s discussion please go ahead joseph joseph dagostino thank you leonard revenue for the year ended december   was  million versus  million for the fullyear of  the increase in total revenue by approximately  million dollars or  was primarily related to the increase in instruments and handpiece sales to china in the domestic market total revenue decreased by approximately  in  as henry schein continued to introduce our instrument to the market and sell down their current inventory we believe that the new agreement with henry schein will be to increase domestic sales of the sta instruments and handpieces in  and the coming years on the international front total revenue increased by approximately  million international instrument sales increased by  million over  due in large part to a shipment of sta instruments to china handpiece sales increased by approximately  compared to  gross profit for the year ended december   was  million or  of revenue versus  million or  of revenue for the year ended december   the decrease in gross profit percentage reflects the increased sales to china which have a lower gross margin as our chinese distributor milestone china is developing and expanding the market in china operating loss for the fullyear ended december   was  million versus an operating loss of  million for  but the additional loss of  million is primarily the result of consolidation of milestone medical in  on a proforma basis the consolidation of milestone medical at december   would have resulted in a loss of approximately  million also equivalent to the consolidated loss in  net loss for the fullyear ended december   was  million or a minus  per share versus a net loss of  million or a minus  per share in  now i would like to turn our attention to the liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  million our working capital was  million a decrease of approximately  compared to december   the decrease in working capital was primarily due to loss from operations in  however we do believe that our cash on hand and revenues from the dental business will be sufficient to operate the going business for our at least the next  months at this point id like to turn the call back to leonard leonard osser thank you joseph given the progress we have made we recently increased our ownership stake in milestone medical our epidural and intraarticular subsidiary to  in february this year and have contracts to exchange additional shares which will give us a  ownership of milestone medical the market potential for both our epidural and intraarticular instruments are significant and we believe increasing our share of ownership will be beneficial for both milestone scientific and milestone medical shareholders having completed the clinical trials of our epidural instrument in the united states we are now accelerating our efforts to enter into international distribution agreements in europe the middle east north africa and now having received approvable in australia as well we look forward to announcing a number of these in the near future in advance of marketing clearance we are cultivating relationships with key opinion leaders who have been supportive and recognize the advantages of our technology this is the essential next step in commercialization of the both products we also continue to advance our platform technology across other indications such as cosmetic ophthalmic and veterinarian instruments as well as pediatric applications finally we completed a public offering in december with gross proceeds of  million which will allow us to accelerate the sales and marketing activities of our epidural instrument we believe this capital raise will be sufficient to support the execution of our growth strategy for the foreseeable future we continue to generate positive cash flow within our dental subsidiary and with the completion of our clinical trials for the epidural instrument the burn rate of our medical subsidiary will be further reduced so to wrap up we remain encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to announcing additional developments as they unfold id like to thank you for joining the call today at this point we would like to open the call up questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will take our first question from anthony vendetti of maxim group your line is open anthony vendetti thank you sure good afternoon guys i just wanted to talk a little bit about henry schein a couple of questions around that so is there a minimum purchase amount that they have either quarterly or for the year in order to maintain their exclusivity joseph dagostino yes this is joseph responding anthony the first two years of business with henry schein there is not a minimum requirement however ive been very much pleased with the progress we’re making to date starting in year three there is a minimum purchase requirement it goes on for the remaining seven years anthony vendetti okay and part of the reason for the shortfall in the fourth quarter was with the fact that they didnt purchase any more or didnt purchase as much as they normally have because they were selling down current inventory is that correct joseph dagostino yeah they were moving very quickly through their hand piece inventory and also for their instruments and they moved forward on a positive basis beginning in january again to replenish their inventory but its also a process of year end for a lot of companies to make sure theyre in a good position anthony vendetti okay and then there was something in the k that said henry schein has a right under certain circumstances to return your products for full credit against the purchase price is that  that sounds like that might be normal legal lease of any contract but i was just curious if theyve ever done that other than working down the inventory have they ever had to return or has there ever been a circumstance where they’ve returned the products joseph dagostino no as you know we have worked with henry schein in the past and basically what they try to do is put everything in the advantage for themselves however they still have customers that want the instruments and the hand pieces so even if we were to end their relationship with them they would still go through the process of a smooth transition to another alternative distributor but also satisfy their current customers along the way so historically weve never had that problem and i dont see that happening because as leonard introduced before they’re the larger supplier of dental medical and veterinary supplies in the world and they have significant customer base that they really do not want to irritate anthony vendetti sure understood and then lastly on henry schein and then one question on the intraarticular so right now when you say no minimum purchase in the first two years does that  did that start in  because thats when the exclusivity started or when do they have a minimum purchase is it in  or joseph dagostino the contract started in june  so were talking about  june anthony vendetti june okay and then on the regulatory front on the intraarticular i know you guys resubmitted the application has the fda come back with any more questions or whats the timeline as best you can tell for right now leonard osser well we’re constantly resubmitting because theyre constantly asking questions the issue would seem to have been the major issue with our difficulties regarding the intraarticular was the human factor study which as you know anthony has nothing to do with the patient its the ease with which the practitioner can use the instruments so weve considerably dumbed it down lack of a better term to make it very very easy we thought that it was quite easy to use but we’ve made it much easier to use and weve gone through really extensive work with outside consultants and well be filing a  page response regarding that this month so i believe that is the last issue of any significance with the fda regarding that product anthony vendetti okay so this month youll file – well it is a long response but i guess its good to be thorough in these situations hoping it’s the last set of questions if its the last set of questions then the fda has up to  days to either come back with more questions hopefully not obviously but or make a decision within  days of submitting your response correct leonard osser yeah our experience this time around with the fda theyve been very responsive as a matter of fact on the epidural side the examiner when she has a question regardless of the time allotted to her to come back shes asked the question right away usually asking us get back to me tomorrow which weve been able to do in every case so i believe were at the end of the process given the questions which we’re being asked at this point but as you know its a guess in dealing with any government institution but i believe that they are being quite fair and theyre trying to expedite the approval for us operator operator instructions we will take our next question from james terwilliger with paulson investment company your line is open james terwilliger yeah thank you just real quick i joined a little bit late on the gross margin side it seemed like they were down a little bit by  basis points can you comment on that is it selling prices or it might be more international business with china or any comments on the gross margins leonard osser yeah as you know we own  milestone scientific owns  of milestone china and the executive team is pushing very hard in china to own over a  market share of injections given in the dental arena in the clinical environment in china which is very very substantial so their objective is to make their money through the disposables not the instruments so we have been helpful with them by having the lowest margins with any distributor that we deal with that’s why you see the margins lower however when you look at the efforts of our dental team throughout the rest of the world you see that that actually has moved up considerably we sold  instruments in ’ and  in the rest of world which is up  also hand pieces have moved up considerably the margin on the sta instrument in rest of world has gone from  to  were quite optimistic in that the sta instruments of  and  ph average pricing is up  whats happening there is sense gian domenico trombetta invested his teams  million and has become the ceo of the dental division his model has been first bring in the top kols throughout the world which is well into that process and hes been quite successful utilizing that to upgrade the distributors that were dealing with so in spite of giving away instruments to key opinion leaders because we dont pay them but we do give them instruments they do clinical studies for free hes been able to bring on far better distributors and up the margins so were beginning to see the result of that we expect that to be significantly greater with both better margins and better volume this year than weve seen but the process that hes initiated is clearly working and were following that process well as we introduced the epidural instrument in other words bring in the top kols in the region use them to train both in their universities all the anesthesiologists then they also have training sessions they lecture they do their own clinicals and that way you move towards other kols in other regions but thats the model that were following so we expect increased margins and increased volume this year in the rest of world we do not expect to increase margins in china but the sales should remain about the same approximately the same with sta instruments but we believe as they put much more attention into putting out the instruments and the training that we will see greater sales in ’ of the disposables and considerably greater sales of both the instruments and the disposables in ’ and’ james terwilliger thanks leon that was an excellent assessment of the strategy and that helped me a lot ive got one other question on the distributor in china and the ownership and i hope this isnt a dumb question but when i look at the income statement we have a loss on earnings from the joint venture in china not a significant loss but nonetheless a loss and you own  so two quick questions does the distributor sell other products besides your products and when do you think and i know its hard for you to speak for that distributor but when would you think that that loss would disappear from the income statement leonard osser i think that the loss will certainly turn around next year maybe in the fourth quarter see their objective is to flood the market with the sta instruments and do extensive training of the dentists and the clinics charge for the procedure which is the most important thing when they have no cost but they have a profit each time they use our instrument the motivation is very very high to use our instrument so thats in fact what theyre doing theyre moving into clinics they charge for the instrument but when the  there is a sinking fund by a financial institution in china and each time the clinic or hospital purchases a box of hand pieces a certain amount of money for that goes into the fund when they reach  boxes of the disposables either in one year of three years whatever that is they then get the money back that they paid for the instrument so the instrument then becomes free this is his model so we anticipate as he moves ahead with this model the same amount of sales of disposable  im sorry of instruments this year but a considerable increase in disposable but we believe if the strategy moves as anticipated that the amount of sta instruments next year and the following year will move up dramatically james terwilliger interesting okay and just lastly does the distributor sell other medical products or are they leonard osser yeah im sorry they do but on a very very minor basis theyre putting virtually all their effort into the sta instrument james terwilliger okay but good thats something that could be a tailwind for you as well going forward just over time pulling in more  some other attractive products besides your attractive product line lastly just very quickly and again i apologize if i missed this the deferral of  million in sales could you  since i probably missed it could you just expand on that again i apologize leonard osser china purchased it’s of the end of the year instruments they paid us  million which was for one container of disposables and  instruments they get special pricing theyre right at the end of a funding which should happen this month and from that funding they will pay for the other  instruments so we will probably  we’ll most probably see another  million in revenues in this quarter because we did not book that in the last quarter james terwilliger okay well good so that was more of a just a push based on the funding issue and off to a good start in  with that and hopefully some additional regulatory approvals ill jump back in queue and thanks for taking my questions sorry i was a little bit late thanks leon leonard osser not at all thank you very much james operator operator instructions and there are no further questions at this time leonard osser thank you all very much and we believe that there will be developments this quarter which we will be announcing thanks again all the best operator that concludes today’s conference thank you for your participation you may now disconnect
