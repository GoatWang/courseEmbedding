standard metals processing inc formerly known as standard gold holdings inc standard gold inc and princeton acquisitions inc was incorporated in the state of colorado on july   on september   we completed a share exchange agreement with hunter bates mining corporation a minnesota corporation hunter bates and certain of its shareholders in which hunter bates shareholders exchanged all of their capital securities into similar capital securities of ours the hunter bates share exchange and we adopted the business model of hunter bates of minerals exploration and mining accordingly the hunter bates share exchange represented a change in control and hunter bates became our wholly owned subsidiary prior to september   wits basin precious minerals inc a minnesota corporation and public reporting company quoted on the pink sheets under the symbol witm wits basin was the majority shareholder of hunter bates hunter bates was formed in april  to acquire the prior producing gold mine properties consisting of land buildings equipment mining claims and permits located in central city colorado known as the bateshunter mine on march   we closed a series of transactions whereby we acquired certain assets of shea mining  milling llc shea mining which assets include land buildings a dormant milling facility abandoned milling equipment water permits mine tailings mine dumps and the assignment of a note payable a lease and a contract agreement with permits we completed the shea exchange agreement in order to offer toll milling services of precious minerals toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein such as gold silver and platinum group metals custom milling and refining can include many different processes to extract precious metals from carbon or concentrates these tollprocessing services also distill dry mix or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies which lack the expertise capacity or regulatory permits for inhouse production the company redomiciled in nevada from colorado in march  we determined that due to a lack of connection to colorado it was in the best interest of the company to move its domicile to nevada modification of corporate strategy with the global collapse of commodity prices the company has altered its strategy to take advantage of the instability in the precious metals market and the lack of liquidity for the junior and midlevel projects in this space the company will seek to establish itself as a specialized mining house that can provide financing in exchange for metals streaming and royalty financing and toll processing services to small to mediumsized mining companies the company will also seek opportunities to acquire current incomeproducing metal streams and royalty contracts supporting the initiative the company has put in place a proven executive team with expertise in the industry the company seeks to take advantage of the current dislocation in the mining sector by providing liquidity into the market for smaller mine operators who have promising development stage projects but limited access to capital the new management team will focus on generating low cost nonprocessing passive income by providing liquidity and specialized services to mining companies in exchange for royalty and metal stream contracts and in some instances common stock and warrants it will also seek to provide toll milling services on a selective basis in exchange for long term feed contracts the above business will be complemented as necessary with a secondary focus on strengthening the management teams of those junior and midlevel mines which will be operating the mines upon which standard will be dependent for revenues overview of the company standard metals processing inc we us our standard metals or the company has offices in gadsden alabama new york new york and through its subsidiary a property in tonopah nevada our business plan is to generating low cost nonprocessing passive income by providing liquidity and specialized services to mining companies in exchange for royalty and metal stream contracts and in some instances common stock and warrants we will also seek to provide toll milling services on a selective basis in exchange for long term feed contracts we are also assessing the opportunity to purchase equipment and build a facility on our tonopah property to serve as a permitted custom processing toll milling facility which includes an analytical lab pyrometallugircal plant and hydrometallurgical recovery plant the company is currently setting up the infrastructure to engage in the royalty and streaming business these elements include a financial partner which the company is currently interviewing possible candidates further the company is seeking and has identified specialty mining counsel to provide legal support and proper contractual relationships to realize the financial fruits of these very specialized relationships as a secondary focus and to further strengthen these junior and midlevel mines the company will perform permitted custom processing toll milling which is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein such as minerals in the gold silver and platinum metal groups custom milling and refining can include many different processes that are designed specifically for each ore load and to maximize the extraction of precious metals from carbon or concentrates these custom processing services also distill dry mix or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies which lack the expertise capacity or regulatory permits for inhouse production we are required to obtain several permits before we can begin construction of a smallscale mineral processing facility and the required additional buildings to conduct permitted processing toll milling activities and commence operations water pollution control permit with the nevada department of environmental protection through the subsidiary of the companys wholly owned subsidiary tonopah custom processing inc tcp a water pollution control permit wpcp application was filed with the nevada department of environmental protection ndep bureau of mines and mining reclamation bmmr for the approval of the permits necessary for a smallscale mineral processing facility planned for the tonopah property the plant will perform laboratory testing pilot testing and custom processing of precious metal ores and concentrates from mining industry clients processing of ore materials will employ standard mineral processing techniques including gravity concentration froth flotation and chemical leaching and carbon stripping the wpcp must be approved prior to commencing the planned construction of our processing plant in tonopah nevada we are still in the technical review stage of our wpcp while the company awaits approval we are preparing for construction of our processing facility which includes working with contractors that will be building the new  square foot processing plant cleaning and preparing the property and refurbishing a trailer that will act as our construction office in connection with our wpcp application ndep suggested that we take the following actions i retain a nevada certified environmental manager cem survey in march  advanced surveying  professional services as our professional land surveyor pls completed surveys and testing of the tonopah property required for the application of our required permits after completion of the survey it was determined the property is  acres the scope of work our pls completed includes i setting a total of  permanent monuments at angle points along lines ii setting eight permanent monuments locating us hwy  equipment facility and site preparation the company received leased heavy equipment on august   which was used to begin cleanup of the site to prepare it for the new construction we ordered a prefabricated building on november   and took delivery of the building on march   the company accepted delivery of additional large heavy equipment on april   we have completed the initial grading of specific designated areas on the  undisturbed acres of land including clearing all vegetation removing of all scrap metal and the excavation of the building pad for the preparation of the new  square foot processing plant with the additional large heavy equipment onsite we have completed the removal of all the extra and unnecessary materials and old equipment that has accumulated on the land in april  we purchased a complete concrete batch plant including four cement trucks to reduce the overall cost of construction activities on site this purchase is estimated to reduce the overall cost of construction by at least  in august  we purchased an extensive array of heavyduty construction and milling equipment for use in the construction and operation of the tonopah facility the heavy equipment allows us to construct the processing plant and tailings ponds using our own equipment saving the cost of expensive lease payments the heavy equipment includes the necessary machinery for construction including dozers loaders water trucks and heavy transport tractors as well as equipment required for production including crushers screening plants and conveyors products and services standard metals processing inc standard metals or the company  otc the above business will be complemented as necessary with a focus on strengthening the management teams of those junior and midsized mining companies which will be operating the mines upon which with whom standard will engage under this secondary focus the company become a full service permitted custom toll milling and processing company that facilitates the extraction of precious and strategic minerals from mined material the company is in the process of obtaining the permits needed for construction and operation of our permitted custom processing toll milling facility with state of the art equipment capable of processing gold silver and platinum metal groups many junior miners do not have the capital or the ability to permit a processing facility yet they have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed it is often cost prohibitive or impractical for these mine operators to send their materials to processing mills owned by the large mining companies or to other customers with badly needed milling and processing services the company is continuing to assess the opportunity to purchase equipment and build a facility on our tonopah nevada property to serve as a permitted custom toll milling facility which includes an analytical lab pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recovery plant while nevada has a historic role as a mining center with good proximate geology and ample mined product very little custom processing toll milling capacity remains in the state during the last several decades other processing facilities have been shuttered due to high costs of regulations and the vertical integration of milling within large mining companies leaving junior miners with few options for local milling services as a result standard metals is in a unique position among processing facilities because it is capable of true permitted custom processing we have the only ball mill located within a custom toll milling facility within  miles allowing us to serve miners in the western united states canada mexico and central america many junior miners are undercapitalized have limited access to capital markets and have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed many large mining companies reserve their milling capacity for their inventory which does not make providing third party services worthwhile this provides the company with an opportunity to provide these potential customers with badly needed milling and processing services currently the company is waiting for the approval of pending applications for the permits required for us to commence construction of our facilities to conduct permitted custom processing toll milling operations royalty and metals stream funding royalty and metals stream funding where the ownerrecipient tobe underwrites a portion of the operators startup costs is a relatively recent financing innovation in the last twenty years where property owners have habitually received royalties from operators this new structure permits the royalty or streaming company to create a passive income interest which incorporates attractive features such as the right to audit while providing the operator access to additional capital without his having to sell equity or take on debt buying or creating royalties or metal streams is the classic case of paying a lump sum up front discounted amount now for a stream of income to be paid later the income will be derived from within a defined property boundary part of the upside is that any additional ores found within that boundary will also be subject to the contract at no further cost to the royalty owner in absolute amounts the buyer expects the cost to incorporate a large discount eg  to the nominal value of the mineable reserve and typically there are additional resources or exploration potential which are incorporated in the deal without further payment in relative terms the amount paid as a lump sum can typically represent anywhere from one half to several times annual the value of one year of annual production depending on the life of the reserves royalty or streaming payments will fluctuate in value with changes in metal prices toll milling toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein such as minerals in the gold silver and platinum metal groups custom milling and refining that are designed specifically for each ore load can include many different processes to maximize the extraction of precious metals from ore carbon or concentrates procedure ore is sent to our facility at the responsibility and cost of the customer the company will take a sample of the ore through a specific ore sampling procedure the companys metallurgist will test the sample on site to obtain a quantitative determination of the amount of a given substance in a particular sample the company can perform wet methods and dry methods in the wet method the sample is dissolved in a reagent like acid until the purified metal is separated out in the dry method the sample is mixed with a flux a substance such as borax or silica that helps lower the melting temperature and then heated so that the impurities in the metal fuse with the flux leaving the purified metal as residue if it is determined that the sample is approved for processing the customer and the company will then agree upon a value of the metal grade per ton if there is any disagreement on the value a third party referee determines the value by testing the sample the company charges either a flat fee per ton of the ore processed or a percentage of the precious metals extracted during processing or a combination of both based on the amount of work that is performed there are various methods of extraction the company will determine which method to use based upon the sample received in most situations a series of tests will be performed on a bulk sample ranging in size from  to  pounds a metallurgist will determine the best process or processes to use for the extraction based on several factors these include the composition of the host rock mineralization of the host rock whether or not it is an oxide or sulphide ore body and the particle size of the precious metal after the metallurgist reviews these characteristics the company will run ore on a gold table and assays the concentrates middlings and tails an assay is an investigative procedure for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence or amount of precious metals in ore if there is too much gold in the middling or tails the size of the grind is adjusted to increase yield or if there is not enough gold in the middlings or tails the company grinds the material to a coarser mesh some of our miner customers will be able to take their tailings the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted from the material they deposited with the company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from this eliminates the need for the company to dispose of those tailings concentrateleach circuit concentration is the separation of precious minerals from other materials by utilizing different properties of the minerals to be separated including density magnetic or electric and physiochemical the company will attempt to create a concentrate of minerals to reduce the size of each ton processed the company may also receive concentrates from customers especially those where transport of tons of raw ore is not feasible the leaching process uses chemicals to extract the metals from the solid materials concentrates and bring them into a solution once the metals are in the solution it is passed through carbon or resin columns where the precious metals are deposited onto the carbonresin the metals will then be stripped from the carbon back into a different solution where they are pumped through an electrowinning circuit in a process called carbon stripping the metals are then deposited onto stainless steel in the electrowinning circuit after this stage the metals are either sold or further refined offsite the solution is recycled and used again to process additional material results of operations for the three and six months ended june   compared to the three and six months ended june   revenues we had no revenues from any operations for the three and six months ended june   and  furthermore we do not anticipate any significant future revenue until we have sufficiently funded operations executed several royalty and streaming contracts at least one of which has begun monetizing the asset and paying on the contract and receive all permits required for us

period in  in the six months ended june   compensation expenses as well as operating expenses increased due to the employment agreements the company entered into with its key officers and the increase in construction costs as we have begun site preparation for the toll milling facility and costs associated with permits research and agreements we anticipate that future compensation expenses will increase and that certain operating expenses will continue to increase for fiscal  as we continue to build the infrastructure to proceed with permitted custom processing toll milling services general

metals processing inc announces corporate name change to cambrian minerals group inc to reflect broader business strategy sep    et from standard metals processing inc new york sept   prnewswire  standard metals processing inc smpr otcbb smpr announced today that it is changing its corporate name to cambrian minerals group inc  the name change reflects a rebranding initiative to better align the companys name with its current and future strategy the new name – cambrian minerals group inc – allows us to emphasize our new business objective of providing a full suite of strategic services to junior and midsized mining companies around the world said bobby cooper ceo of cambrian metals group inc as our new management team identified opportunities to take advantage of the current dislocation in the commodity markets and formulated our new strategy it was clear that we needed a new name to better represent the scope of the companys offerings  the name change to cambrian minerals group reflects the broader focus and strategic solutions we now provide to smaller mining operations which include financing processing and management expertise in consideration for longterm royalty metals streams and material feedstock contracts continued cooper in alignment with the name change the company will shortly be announcing its new website logo and ticker symbol about standard metals incthe company intends to refocus its efforts into the acquisition and creation of royalty and streaming contracts with junior and midsize mining companies in order to provide financing to develop or improve their mineral properties royalty and streaming arrangements are structures that have been successfully implemented by companies such as royal gold franconevada silver wheaton and others these structures enable mine owners to obtain alternative less dilutive financing in exchange for an interest in the form of a royalty or a metals stream contract  the company believes the current dislocation in mining capital markets presents an ideal time to raise capital and provide an alternate form of financing for junior and mid level companies additionally standard intends to continue to seek opportunities to construct tollmilling facilities both domestically and abroad in selective areas the company believes that it can organically grow the company faster by providing needed processing facilities in order to spur the development of mines in conjunction with providing toll milling solutions our strategy would be to create royalties and stream contracts with the companies operating the mines who utilize the toll milling arrangement thus generating two separate and discrete revenue streams from a single mining property  forwardlooking statementthis release

that bobby has joined smpr and that we have added an industry veteran with such vast large cap and entrepreneurial experience in the mining industry to help build out our business when approached by management of standard metals i immediately recognized the opportunity to work with respected industry professionals to build a vitally needed resource for junior and midsize mining companies i am

nickel copper aluminum alloy specialization offers insulation from competitionmetal center news  march by tim triplett editorinchief many in red metals are struggling but standard metals has found success in various niches including specialty alloys for military applications and waterjet cuttingwith its focus on specialty copper and brass alloys sales to both commercial and military markets and sophisticated processing standard metals inc has remained largely above the fray in the red metals marketstandard metals was founded in  by president and owner a stephen buzash jr the company operates out of a single  square foot facility in hartford ct with ten long time employeesas a result of this cadre workforce we have a depth of product knowledge that many engineers and other service centers call on for specification type questions buzash saysthough the company is small the specialized nature of its products and services makes it a national and often international supplierstandard metals carries one of the largest selections of domestic red metal alloys in the united states it sells copper brass bronze and thirteen different specialty alloys in its commercial line its military line includes copper nickel c and c nickel aluminum bronze c and c bronze c and c and the monel equivalent n alloys often used for marine applications due to their resistance to the corrosive effects of saltwatermilitary contractors that make parts for ships and submarines as well as aircraft bushings represent about  of the companys  accounts but make up nearly half its sales buzash estimatesdealing with military contractors that sell to uncle sam is a doubleedged sword the number of competitors in the market is limited and barriers to entry are significant on the other hand the governments specifications are extremely exacting and its paperwork requirements are dauntingwe deal in highly specified material with pedigreed certification which is not a simple market niche buzash says a lot of people have tried it and gotten out sometimes twice to be a government supplier standard metals must have an approved quality system in place which is continuously audited every ounce of metal it sells must be documented and tracked from the moment it is produced to the time its sold including the exact heat from which it was processed its chemistry and composition and physical characteristicswe have to track that material from cradle to grave and then we have to hold onto that paperwork for ten years in case there is ever a part failure buzash says in fact we have never thrown a piece of paper away we have twentyone years of recordsstandard metals inventory and sales management system based on metalware software facilitates such record keeping we can track heats costs locations usage customers pricing history duplicate quotes and many more functions buzash notesso far standard metals military related business has seen no direct effect from the war in afghanistan or the republican administrations plans for increased defense spending we were the busiest when they were building trident submarines now they are only building one sub a year theyre not in a big shipbuilding mode right now if we get into one that will help our business buzash sayscopper prices currently in the seventycent range are near historic lows the market has been battered by the recessionary economy and declining demand in key markets such as electronics and telecommunications but the specialized nature of standard metals products and buzashs business philosophy keep the company out of the price competition gamewhen you have to buy  pounds of an alloy which you will only sell occasionally in pound lots you cant afford to discount the price is the price buzash saysunlike many distributors today who focus on reducing stock to maximize inventory turns buzash focuses on having what customers need when they need it he estimates his company gets less than two full inventory turns per yeari am a stocking distributor i make the investment in this highly certified product and lay it on the floor when someone needs something quickly they come to us he explains i refuse to broker at all i dont ask the customer to wait twenty weeks until i can get it from the millbuzash favors domestic suppliers over imports because he believes in supporting the american economy standard metals sources from us market leaders such as ansonia copper  brass bunting bearings corp concast metal products electralloy hussey copper ngk metals and revere copper products he expresses concern that america is losing its industrial base and that it is in danger of losing domestic sources for certain alloys used in components critical to some military applicationsprocessing equipmentstandard metals operates a variety of processing equipment one horizontal plate saw three vertical saws two cutoff saws two milling machines three hand lathes and one mazak cnc turning center in addition to bridge cranes and forkliftsbut its the companys most recent additions two abrasive waterjet systems that offer the most promise waterjet systems have not saturated most markets yet which means there is not a lot of price competition for waterjet services buzash saysstandard metals invested in waterjetting in  and now operates two machines made by flow international the latest bought in june  has a ft by ft bed and is capable of cutting through  inches of steel the waterjet setup incorporates a closed loop system made by ebbco which filters the water and recycles it through the cutting head eliminating any potential wastewater problemwe invested in waterjet processing equipment to augment our plate sales as many of our customers wanted rings circles and other shapes precut from plate and sheet we have cut many different metal alloys of sheet and plate as well as wood rubber plastic fiberglass laminate foam felt cork even granite black onyx and glass buzash saysalmost any two dimensional material can be cut with abrasive waterjet to tolerances of up to   if you can live with tolerances like that waterjet beats the devil out of normal milling in terms of speed and price buzash saysbuzash expects his commercial sales to be off by  percent this year compared to  sales to military customers are likely to dip  percent as well unless the bush administration increases military spending this year he doesnt expect a significant turnaround in the economy until the poor economy makes standard metals foray into waterjets all the more timely buzash says the waterjetting segment of the business will more than compensate for the lost margin of the sales decline from a margin point of view this year we should be finewhile the rest of the copper market is suffering from low prices buzash is laying in inventory anticipating rising tags in  its a good time to be buying inventory at these pricesbuzash sums up his formula for success we have strived to be the best in a specific portion of the market we demand loyalty from customers employees and suppliers we never broker always prefer domestic over foreign regardless of price and we do not want to grow just for the sake of being big printable page email this pageback to top
