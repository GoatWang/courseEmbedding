truth interviews william lane craig closer to truthrobert lawrence kuhn host of pbs closer to truth asks william lane craig on gods omniscience questions explored what does it mean for god to be omniscience what is meant by proposition what is meant by nonpropositional knowledge does god have propositional or nonpropositional knowledge what is the difference between natural knowledge free knowledge and middle knowledge who is luis de molinatranscriptrobert lawrence kuhn bill i’m not sure whether i believe in god but if i do understanding god’s characteristics to me is very important and one of the most interesting ones is that god is this word omniscient—knowing everythingdr craig rightrobert lawrence kuhn what does that meandr craig traditionally a person is omniscient if for any proposition p that person knows that p and does not believe not p in other words—robert lawrence kuhn p meaning any statementdr craig —any proposition any statementrobert lawrence kuhn any statement of fact or…dr craig right exactly so that an omniscient person would be someone who knows only and all truthsrobert lawrence kuhn okay now what is truth i mean what kinds of truth are there truths that exist and truths that don’t exist and possible truthsdr craig well that’s why i defined it in terms of propositions proposition is the information content of a declarative sentence take any declarative sentence it expresses a certain information content and the idea of omniscience is that there is no fact of the matter there is no truth true information that this person does not know and he believes no false proposition so he would know only and all factsrobert lawrence kuhn but there are more things in the world than just pure factsdr craig well that is a very interesting point i think you’re right about that there is another type of knowledge that we could call nonpropositional knowledge and this would be knowledge—for example how to ride a bicycle or how a watermelon tastes or things of that sort but omniscience isn’t typically defined in terms—robert lawrence kuhn how it feels to have an interview togetherdr craig that’s right or for example how it feels to be a sinner and clearly god couldn’t have that kind of—robert lawrence kuhn you and i have never had that feelinglaughterdr craig well i certainly have but god wouldn’t have that sort of feeling and therefore omniscience is defined in terms of propositional knowledge of knowing only and all truths but not necessarily having all nonpropositional knowledge in fact when you think about it you would be mentally ill if you had all nonpropositional knowledge because you would believe not only for example in my case that i am bill craig but i would believe i am napoleon or i am ronald reagannow if ronald reagan believes that he is ronald reagan or napoleon believes he is napoleon that’s a cognitive perfection—he is but if i were to believe that that would be not a perfection that would be an imperfectionrobert lawrence kuhn rightdr craig so to have all nonpropositional knowledge would actually be a negative propertyrobert lawrence kuhn so what you’re telling me is to know everything is not to know everythingdr craig right when we say to know everything what we mean is knowing all truths knowing all true propositions and believing no false proposition and therefore it avoids these problems like “does god have to know what it’s like to be ronald reagan” well no only ronald reagan knows that and if god believed he were ronald reagan he would be mentally incompetent so that’s not a perfectionthe idea of omniscience flows out of the perfection of god saint anselm defined god as the greatest conceivable being well the greatest conceivable being would know all truth and he would have appropriate nonpropositional knowledge he would know “i am god i am omnipotent i am omniscient” but he wouldn’t know “i am ronald reagan” that would be an imperfectionrobert lawrence kuhn but he would know what ronald reagan felt being ronald reagandr craig exactly and that’s a propositional truth that ronald reagan knows that he is a movie star that he is the president that he has dealt with gorbachev all of those propositions god would know he would know for example that it feels lousy to be a sinner that sinners feel guilty and condemned—things of that sort he would know all those propositions but he wouldn’t have that nonpropositional knowledge of believing that he is himself ronald reagan or that he is tasting a watermelon or something of that sortso it’s a subtle idea i’m shocked quite honestly at how quickly you unearthed this normally most people would just say “yeah he knows only and all truth” and that’s the end of it but you’re right to be cognitively perfect you actually have to be more than omniscientrobert lawrence kuhn be selectivedr craig yes that’s right you have to have all propositional knowledge and then you have to have in addition to that the appropriate nonpropositional knowledge—appropriate to yourself and both of those elements will be part of god’s cognitive perfection so god is actually greater than omniscient and i remember when i first realized this i was just stunned at the idea that god is even more cognitively perfect than being omniscient i thought omniscience was the ultimate and it’s not god is even more than omniscientrobert lawrence kuhn true omniscience in the sense of knowing everything would be total confusiondr craig yes that would be an imperfection not a perfection and therefore wouldn’t be part of god’s character as the most perfect beingrobert lawrence kuhn there are three kinds of characteristics of god’s knowledge which i’d like you to help me understand natural knowledge free knowledge and what’s called middle knowledgedr craig right this is the way in which the catholicjesuit theologian luis molina in the sixteenth century analyzed god’s knowledge and what molina said is that although everything god knows he knows at once nevertheless there is a kind of priority in god’s knowledge a sort of logical order or an explanatory order and he said at the most fundamental level is god’s natural knowledge and this would be god’s knowledge of everything that is necessarily true two plus two equals four if it is raining it is raining everything that has a shape has a size—any necessary truths would belong to god essentially and he could not lack that knowledge this knowledge is natural to god and essential to god so molina called it natural knowledge and this would include god’s knowledge of all possibilities everything that could happen every possible worldrobert lawrence kuhn that’s logical—he couldn’t square a circle or things like thatdr craig that would be an impossibility so that’s rightrobert lawrence kuhn anything possible that’s logically possibledr craig yes that’s correct and then in the third area or tier of his knowledge is what molina called free knowledge and this would be god’s knowledge of all contingently true propositions that are dependent upon his will and this would include things like george bush is the president of the united states in robert lawrence kuhn now tell me why that’s contingent it’s because it is not necessarily truedr craig it’s not necessarily true and moreover it’s dependent upon god’s will which world to create the free knowledge depends upon god’s decision to create one world rather than another and had he created a different world quite a different set of propositions would’ve been truerobert lawrence kuhn that’s why they’re contingentdr craig exactly and so he would’ve had different knowledge so the free knowledge of god is not essential to god he could’ve known other propositions to be true that are in fact false had he created a different worldrobert lawrence kuhn so now we have the two boundaries we have natural knowledge which is everything that god knows necessarilydr craig yesrobert lawrence kuhn and we have free knowledge which are the contingent truths because god chose a certain world to actualize to make realdr craig yes that’s right that’s rightrobert lawrence kuhn okay i have the two boundaries now what’s in the middledr craig now molina’s innovation was saying in between those there is a third kind of knowledge and for lack of a better name he called it middle knowledge because it’s in the middlerobert lawrence kuhn laughs okay that i can followdr craig and middle knowledge is god’s knowledge of what every possible person that he could create would freely do in any circumstances god might place him so god would know for example that if i were to create peter in a certain set of circumstances he would deny christ three times now this kind of knowledge—robert lawrence kuhn and he would know for example that if i am in a situation asking you a question i would ask you a silly questiondr craig right and he would know that i would give a silly answer if i were in that set of circumstances now he might not want us to embarrass ourselves on television and therefore he would not create us in those circumstances knowing we would be more seriousrobert lawrence kuhn laughs rightdr craig but the idea of middle knowledge is that prior to his decision explanatorily prior to his decision to create a world he knows how any possible person he might create would freely choose in any circumstances he might place that person now this knowledge is unique because it is not necessary to god that he know this it’s dependent upon how we would freely choose and we have the ability in those circumstances to do otherwiseso this knowledge isn’t essential to god in the way that his natural knowledge is it’s contingent in the way that his free knowledge is and yet it isn’t dependent upon his decision which world to create because it is on the basis of his middle knowledge that god will then decide which persons to create and which persons to place them inrobert lawrence kuhn because explanatorily prior he would know his middle knowledge of all the different possible worlds he could createdr craig yesrobert lawrence kuhn so he might choose a specific world to create based upon this middle knowledge knowing the results of each worlddr craig exactly and so in that sense middle knowledge is like his natural knowledge in that it’s explanatorily prior to his decree to create a certain world so in this explanatory hierarchy you have natural knowledge which is god’s knowledge of everything that could be then you have his middle knowledge which is his knowledge of everything that would be then you have the divine decree to create a particular world and then posterior to that finally would be his free knowledge and this is his knowledge of everything that will be and that’s molina’s theory of middle knowledge of god’s omnisciencerobert lawrence kuhn and do you agree with thatdr craig yes when i first encountered this i was stunned at the theological power of this idea if you take this notion of middle knowledge and you apply it to various difficult theological conundrums you will find it will be a key that will unlock the mystery to many of these difficult theological problems that folks have wrestled with for centuries and i dare to say that i think this theory of middle knowledge is the most powerful theological concept that i’ve ever encountered in my life    total running time time  receive our free newsletter get dr craigs newsletter and keep up with rf news and events subscribe support reasonable faith reasonable
