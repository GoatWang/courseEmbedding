with their external environment and the behavior of administrators and managers within organizationscriminal justiceorganizational principles and correctionsleaders in correctional management began making contributions to the better organization of prisons and jails in the th century such early leaders were john howard jeremy bentham alexander maconochie dorothea lynde dix elam lynds and zebulon reed brockway in the th century new ideas were offered by reformminded leaders seeking to further improve on prison and jail organization three famous thcentury correctional reformers were katharine
