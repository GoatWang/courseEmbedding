baggage and air freight homeland security portal monitor the antech b baggage and air freight homeland security portal monitor is designed to detect radioactive materials in baggage and air freight containers it has both gamma ray and neutron detection capability the gamma ray measurements are performed by sensitive shielded and collimated plastic scintillator detectors that use low noise photo multiplier tubes with state of the art digital electronics the neutron measurements are performed by polyethylene moderated high pressure ³he detectors that identify the presence of plutonium by passive neutron counting they are connected to highspeed charge collection electronics and operate in totals counting mode the technology behind the antech b is derived from work performed at the los alamos national laboratory lanl in the united states and implemented in the late s by jomar systems since the transfer of this technology to antech extensive improvements have been made and antech portal monitoring technology represents the current state of the art for homeland security monitoring antech continues to work with technology developers at lanl who are engaged in a process of continual development with a view to optimising the performance of portal monitors for homeland security and defence related applications bdatasheet description features  benefits specification description the operation of the b is automated by an onboard microprocessor controller that performs system diagnostic testing input monitoring and background discrimination the controller employs algorithms based on the sequential probability ratio test sprt developed originally by fehlau and others at lanl the b contains all the necessary electronics including controller power supplies amplification single channel analyser and high voltage bias supplies to constitute a robust stand alone instrument the b is available in the standard configuration that surrounds a conveyor as illustrated above it is compliant with the requirements of astm c and consistent with the requirements of astm c features  benefits features rsethernet interface for controller setup or remote monitoring user selectable alarm provided as visual audio or electronic signal digital detector electronics including low noise photomultiplier archiving of detection and background statistics operation in continuous pass through or hold and measure mode benefits reliable operation with very low rate of false alarms uses digital electronics with reduced electrical noise unattended automatic
