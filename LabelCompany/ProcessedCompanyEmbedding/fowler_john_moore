julian critchley described him as being handsome with the sort of looks that would have appealed to j arthur rank personable and polite he looks ten years younger than his  years margaret thatcher appointed moore as one of five conservative party vicechairmen in march  shortly after she became conservative leader moores remit was youth he held this position until the conservatives were returned to office in  at which time he was appointed as parliamentary undersecretary of state for energy in this capacity one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised british coal industry after the  general election moore was appointed economic secretary to the treasury under chancellor nigel lawson at the treasury moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation most notably he oversaw the privatisation of british telecom in  and that of several other major concerns the privatisation of stateowned industries was a major feature of the thatcher governments these privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices this promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the dean witter business model moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as mr privatisation cabinet careeredit he joined mrs thatchers cabinet in  as secretary of state for transport his tenure of office at transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the m london orbital motorway and the privatisation of british airways the capsizing of the herald of free enterprise car ferry outside zeebrugge harbour on  march  gave moore considerable media exposure these events served to raise moores profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the  general election  what probably clinched his promotion to the dhss yesterday was his tv performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left it was thatcher herself who suggested that moore be used on it the broadcast was according to one observer considered sharp nasty – and effective by now moore was being widely spoken of as a future prime minister the commentator brian walden wrote  he has future tory leader written all over him after the  election he was appointed as secretary of state for social services in this capacity he was responsible for the national health services £ billion annual spend and the payment of over £ billion annually in the form of social security benefits these were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the  government however there were some early misgivings about the appointment julian critchley described moores earlier career in government as the script had been written for him and he had only to learn his lines other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy once established in his new job moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services these speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance similar to the american model specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions taxdeductible and allowing nurses wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups including the royal college of physicians many conservative backbench mps had misgivings about what was being proposed furthermore some of the speeches suggested that moore was positioning himself to be leader of the conservative party during a visit to the us in october  he delivered a speech to the mont pelerin society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the uk this displeased his fellow ministers and other senior party figures moore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set the then chief secretary to the treasury john major was reported to have found moore to be a soft touch the then health minister edwina currie is reported to have described moore as being useless an entry in her diary dated january  reads it became apparent during the first ten days  that moore just didnt know what to do moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at  am moores wife and political adviser sheila had clashes with civil servants and moore was privately warned that she did not understand the british way of doing things it is believed that sheila may have drafted some of moores more controversial speeches in november  moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia he initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered during the meeting he became unconscious he was subsequently admitted to the parkside hospital in wimbledon the fact that this was a private clinic owned by a german healthcare company reportedly charging patients up to £ per day attracted bad publicity union leader rodney bickerstaffe stated how can a social services secretary claim to care about the national health service when he does not even trust his own health care to an nhs hospital end of political careeredit after two months absence due to illness moore returned to work but by now his political prospects were much diminished on  july  he lost the health portfolio to kenneth clarke moore retained his social security portfolio and stayed in cabinet as secretary of state for social security for a further year however his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern britain his attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by conservative backbench mps moore was sacked from the cabinet in july  most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability he was written off by one tory as like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights he gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the  general election and subsequently held a number of directorships with large concerns including credit suisse asset management and rolls royce plc he has recentlywhen retired as chairman of the monitor group europe after leaving the commons in  moore became a life peer as baron moore of lower marsh of lower marsh in the london borough of lambeth a bbc feature in august  reported that after  years in the house of lords moore had still to make his maiden speech while he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective  but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security  and he just bombed referencesedit  lvs homepage  the times  october

the state linkedin google pinterest reddit print order reprint of this story hammond soccer is a family affair don’t believe it how many other high school programs in south carolina can say they feature four sets of brothers if that’s not enough take into consideration  current players have a mother or father who attended hammond that’s a pretty fair number of players who probably have heard the stories of what it means to be a hammond student from their parents “the number of kids that have parents that are hammond alumni is very cool” hammond coach adrian pinasco said “the kids want to represent their school and parents they work very hard representing themselves and the history of this school” senior ross moore and freshman john bailey moore grew up hearing stories about the heyday of hammond soccer their father martin moore played on four state championship teams at hammond before he graduated in  the brothers are glad to be carrying on the family legacy “it means a lot to carry on the tradition” john bailey moore said as the skyhawks prepared for wednesday’s scisa class a semifinal contest against portergaud “it’s amazing how many details he can remember it makes me want to make the most of my time here” the fact that hammond hasn’t won a state championship in boys soccer since  doesn’t sit well with the current roster most people think of football when discussing hammond athletics the players understand for that to change they have to win state championships instead of making deep runs in the playoffs junior isaac mikell whose dad jenkins mikell graduated in  and played soccer for hammond believes the skyhawks are on the brink of breaking through “why can’t soccer win a state championship” he asked “my dad was on state championship teams and he talks all the time about how special that was to experience all of our teams at hammond have the opportunity to be the best” there is a friendly rivalry as well the current players have heard the war stories but they want to be able to equal or top what their parents accomplished sophomore sumpter clarke hears the stories from his dad edward clarke a  graduate he said the biggest thing for him is to oneup his dad “from a personal standpoint i want to top what he did” sumpter clarke said “we have a fun time going back and forth he’s always telling me they were better than us but you can tell he’s proud of whatever we do on the soccer field” pinasco played professional soccer in argentina he has coached on the collegiate level and when he came to hammond  years ago he had a winatallcosts mentality that has changed over the years “it’s about the culture and what it means to be a part of the hammond family” pinasco said “these kids are true hammond products because their parents went here and they’ve been in the school since they started” siblings in the hammond soccer program c rush special to the state never miss a local story sign up today for a  day free trial of unlimited
