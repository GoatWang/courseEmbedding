ask before hiringthere are different kinds of electricians some mostly work with contractors to install and map out electrical circuits inside homes and commercial buildings while others lay wire for large projects such as telephone lines and traffic lights keep this in mind when narrowing your search for a professional if you need a tradesperson to work on your home or building contact an inside or house wire expert these professionals specialize in designing and putting new electrical systems in place for houses and commercial buildingswhen you contact an electrical contractor describe the job that needs completing maybe you have a large project like a remodeling plan that requires new wiring or a small one such as replacing a light switch or socket let the electrician know not every person you call will have the training and knowhow to do more complex workto further hone your search make sure you ask electricians the following questions before hiring are you licensed trades such as hvac plumbing and electrical work require contractors to carefully install complicated systems that could be hazardous if theyre installed incorrectly therefore most states require electricians to receive training and obtain a license before working an electrician thats licensed is one thats competent and knowledgeable enough of his or her trade to install and maintain electrical systemselectricians must complete thousands of hours of training in order to get a license to practice their trade so make sure not only the company you choose but the employees doing the work show you their license when you view the license ensure that its up to date and that its issued by your state are you bonded theres potentially a lot that can go wrong if a tradesperson like an electrician installs wiring the wrong way to spare you and your home or office from subpar work make sure the electrician is bonded being bonded means the professional has an intermediary that can pay for any damage caused to a property or foot the bill if the contractor fails to finish the job are you insured besides a bond you also need an electrician thats insured many states require contractors to carry some form of insurance along with their license insist that whomever you hire has the proper amount of insurance for the work you need done and call the insurer to check the policysee that who you hire for the job has liability and workers compensation insurance so you dont end up paying for injuries or accidents caused by the companys work workers compensation insurance means the business can provide for any of its employees if theyre hurt on the job is your business licensed not only should you check that the electrician is licensed by your state you should also ask if his or her company has the certification to operate in your area both the electrician as well as the business he or she works for need licenses either issued by the state or local municipality who will do the work ensure the person who actually comes out to complete the work is licensed bonded and insured you need to know not just the company thats doing the work but the person theyre sending out to your home or building make sure the employee doing the job isnt an unsupervised apprentice if it happens that the business uses a subcontractor check with both the company and the tradesperson that the same kind of bond and insurance applies for that subcontractor as it would for an employee how much do you charge by the hour if you have a small and simple job that needs completing such as a new light switch then ask the electrician how much they charge for it before hiring him or her when it comes to larger more intensive and timeconsuming work youll want to inquire about the contractors hourly rate many tradespeople will offer to come out to your home or building examine it and give you an estimate as well as tell you how much they charge per hour its best to get this in writing before proceedingwhile youre at it call several electricians to come out to your home to give you an estimate on the work this way you can get an idea of what the average price of the job will be do you offer a warranty many reputable tradespeople provide warranties for their work inquire if both the labor and parts the electrician uses are under warranty and how long the work is guaranteed for do you have or need a permit depending on what kind of repairs or installation you need your city could require a permit for the electrical work ask your electrician if the job calls for one and have him or her put the permit under his or her name ensuring the tradesperson obtains a permit will safeguard you from any blame if the labor turns out to be subparhow to hire a reputable electricianfinding a trustworthy electrician isnt hard but you must do your due diligence make sure whomever you hire is licensed bonded and insured and that the professional can show you proof of all three as well as get the necessary permit for the job besides these important factors you can take further steps to guarantee you obtain a reputable tradesperson get referrals ask your family friends or neighbors if they can recommend a professional to you and inquire if theyre pleased with the work better yet ask them if they can show you the project the electrician completed and ask them how long it took the worker to complete it look online it cant hurt to also check electricians out online look for reviews ratings and most importantly see if they have any complaints on file with your municipality or with your local business bureaus if former customers filed grievances against them you may want to steer clear ask for a quote reputable electricians will give you a quote for small work over the phone if you ask and will travel to your home to quote you a price for larger jobs be wary of one that declines to give you an estimate or insists that he or she charge you for coming out to your house ask them about their experience being bonded licensed and insured is all well and good but you also need an experienced professional to do the work with that said interview electricians about past projects they completed and how many years theyve been in business or how much training they have be wary of suspiciously low estimates watch out for contractors that greatly underbid other electricians if the price seems too good to be true it probably is also always remember to get the estimate in writing before settling on a companyareas of specializationwhile all electricians need a license not all of them do the same types of jobs they are usually split up into three groups outside inside and residentialoutside these types of electricians work outdoors on electrical lines that connect to power plants inside inside experts typically focus on commercial and industrial buildings that require a lot of power residential if youre a homeowner youll most likely need to hire an electrician that specializes in residential wiring residential electricians work with lowvoltage systems and wiring to install fuse boxes and light fixturestraininglike many trade groups electricians learn their craft by going to vocational schools and shadowing professionals on the job in order to become a fullfledged professional a person must undergo an apprenticeship with master and journeyman electricians an apprentice needs  hours of practical work before graduating to the journeyman levelif an apprentice reaches journeyman status he or she can complete most electrical work but cannot design it until completing more testing along with  more onthejob hourssafety tips to keep in mindmany doityourself enthusiasts might be inclined to fix electrical problems around their home but they risk shock and bodily injury its always best to call a licensed electrician even if you have something as small as an improperly working wall outletkeep the following safety tips in minddo not operate any electrical equipment while sitting or standing in waterdont overload extension cords or surge protectorsput caps on your electrical outlets if you have small childrencall an electrician if you notice your sockets or switches are warm to the touch discolored or if they make noisekeep electrical cords away from stoves ovens and other sources of heatdo not use an appliance that has a frayed corddo not staple extension cords into place or cover them with carpets or furniturewhen using extension cords make sure to unwrap them before plugging them indont overuse extension cords have an electrician install extra outlets if you need a power source closer to youonly use light bulbs with the correct wattage for your lamps and light fixturescontact a licensed electrician if you frequently blow fuses since this can be a sign of an electrical wiring problemhave an electrician look at your fuse box to ensure you have the right size fuses and circuit breakers the wrong size fuse or breaker can be a fire hazardif you have fault circuit interrupters installed in your electrical panel make sure you test them at least once a month by turning them on
