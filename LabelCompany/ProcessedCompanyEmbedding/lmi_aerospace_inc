minerals the registrant must annually submit a conflict minerals report to the sec that includes a description of those due diligence measures undertaken pursuant to the rule per sec guidance if a

information on our products please see the company’s form ka filed with the sec on april   which is available on our website at httpirlmiaerospacecomsecfilingcfmfilingidcik   reasonable country of origin inquiry and due diligence we developed a listing of suppliers that provided us raw materials and components with the possibility of providing conflict minerals and whether those conflict minerals were necessary to our products production or functionality as a result of this analysis we established with a considerable degree of confidence that certain raw materials and components we purchase contain conflict minerals we then surveyed all direct raw material and component suppliers in our supply chain where opportunity existed to provide raw materials and components that contained conflict minerals due to the complexity of our products and the number of suppliers in our supply chain we rely on our direct suppliers to provide the relevant information on the origin of any conflict minerals that may be contained in the products they supply to us to conduct our rcoi commercially available software which utilizes the conflict minerals reporting template cmrt developed jointly by the electronic industry citizenship coalition and global esustainability initiative “eiccgesi” was utilized to request and consolidate conflict minerals information from our suppliers this same process was used as newly identified suppliers were added after our initial survey circulation reminder requests were sent or phone calls were made to suppliers that failed to provided responses to our survey or that were incomplete or otherwise required further clarification or provided responses to our initial survey that indicated that their components contained conflict minerals that may have come from a covered country we received responses from approximately  of the more than  suppliers surveyed and are continuing efforts to followup with unresponsive suppliers or responsive suppliers with incomplete or unclear answers there were a number of suppliers whose responses and documentation indicated that their components did not contain conflict minerals and thus required no additional followup we conducted additional followup with the remaining suppliers to clarify certain responses that were provided it will take time for the remaining suppliers to verify the origin of all of the conflict minerals that are included in the raw materials and components we purchase from them the majority of responses that were received provided data at a broader company level and as such the information provided may not be directly applicable to the specific products supplied to lmi additionally a number of these suppliers were not able to determine with any certainty the country of origin of the conflict minerals in their products these suppliers were also unable to represent to us the smelters or refiners that they use as the source of the conflict minerals actually included in the product they supplied to us therefore we are unable to provide any smelter or refiner names to list in this report we expect that our continued communication and coordination with our suppliers will further develop transparency into our supply chain   conflict minerals analysis and conclusion we believe our due diligence process was reasonably designed conducted in good faith and generally consistent with the organization for economic cooperation and development due diligence guidance “oecd guidance” to determine the origin of the conflict minerals identified as necessary to our products’ production or functionality however we do not currently have sufficient information from a number of our suppliers or other sources to determine the country of origin of the conflict minerals contained in some of our products accordingly the company cannot rule out the possibility that some of these conflict minerals may have originated from a covered country and may have been used to finance or otherwise benefit armed groups operating in those covered countries  next steps the company has implemented the following conflict minerals policy which is available on its website at httpwwwlmiaerospacecomsuppliermanagement  lmi is committed to compliance with section  of the us wall street reform and consumer protection act to satisfy customer requirements and the goals of the act lmi and its suppliers will strive to provide only conflict free products through responsible and appropriate sourcing activities lmis approved suppliers both public and private are required to conduct due diligence on the presence of conflict minerals in their supply chain and provide accurate reporting and certifications on the presence of conflict minerals in products provided to lmi suppliers unwilling to implement procedures which assure only conflict free products are supplied to lmi may be ineligible for lmi approved supplier status additionally the company has included instructional information on its website for the use of its suppliers an overview of conflict mineral reporting and instruction on how to properly complete a conflict mineral reporting template the company will continue to look to industry guidelines and best practices to further refine its policies and procedures consistent with its conflict minerals policy specifically moving forward the company will take the following steps to improve its due diligence to mitigate the risk that conflict minerals in company products benefit armed groups in the covered countries • continued refinement and strengthening of the company’s established due diligence framework consistent with the oecd guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and high riskareas • evaluation of additional consequences for the company’s new and existing suppliers that fail to comply with the company’s conflict minerals policy • coordination and communication with suppliers regarding their need to develop a robust chain of custody or traceability systems • additional evaluation of alternate commercially available software that leverages the eeicgesi template to improve the rcoi process while providing improved compliance tracking and • additional training and outreach as needed on compliance with the conflict minerals policy  lmi aerospace inc  current report print email pdf word
