reinvention youtubers and the one product she cant live withoutby kristen batemankristenvbatemanjune  facebook dialogpinterestfacebook dialogpinterestemailmegan thomasits been just a little over six months since bobbi brown announced shed be leaving her namesake makeup line yet already shes released her ninth book beauty from the inside out makeup wellness confidence and announced her plan to renovate a hotel in her hometown of montclair new jersey with her husband steven plofkerthe iconic makeup artist author former editor and brand founder launched her brand at bergdorf goodman in  and sold it to estee lauder just a few years later in  she made a name for herself with products that suited a wide variety of skin tones as well as products that were made to look more your real skin lip color and cheeks than actual makeup i got a lot of inspiration and i still do from peoples skin and their faces she said referring to the time she created a lip stain inspired by the way her three sons lips looked after eating popsiclesyou may also likemakeuphayley williamss makeup artist spills her behindthescenes beauty secretsmakeupthe anastasia beverly hills subculture palette was just leaked on redditi think the most important thing is the overall message which to me is about how to take care of yourself from the inside out said brown of her brand new book during a conversation with christene barberich at the fresh themed popup concept shop story on a grey and humid new york city nightbrown curated a few of her favorite wellness products for the shop which rotates themes every four to eight weeks this time was in partnership with jetcom and was inperson to talk about everything from her views of teenage beauty today to her morning routine at the end of the talk she responded to an audience members question of whats next with the possibly of doing more in the wellness space too — though she couldnt divulge just what exactly shell be up to yetwe sat down with brown right before the event to talk about nomakeup makeup youtubers beauty regrets and moreyour latest book is about beauty from the inside out but theres also a bit about personal reinvention is there a specific moment in your life when you feel your reinvented yourself with makeupi reinvented myself in october when i left the company now i honestly wear so much less makeup than i normally would have worn i kind of think i look better everyday is different and it seems like everyday i’m either photographed or on tv or facebook live or something but normally i’ll do my makeup in the car i always put moisturizer on sometimes face oil because my skin is dry corrector concealer mascara eyebrows sometimes i do liner i’ve been skipping foundation though and just putting blush onif you could only wear one product what would it bei would say it would have to be a pinky bronzey creamy formula that i could put on my lips my cheeks and my eyes one of my favorites was a bobbi brown cream blush and it was exactly that color i never liked blushes that were creamtopowder i liked fullon creambut i’ve been using a lot of coconut oil on my skin and i’ve been using a bunch of rms’ undertheeyes concealers and they are really natural looking i use coconut oil on everything though i take my makeup off with it at night then i put more of it on i use it on my hair my feet my everythingyou launched your makeup line in  and have worked in beauty for decades how do you think the concept of beauty as identity has changed over the yearsit’s changed immensely i was a middle schooler going into high school and if you weren’t barbie or cheryl tiegs you weren’t considered attractive with blonde hair and blue eyes — that was it then as i got older i started to look at some brunettes ali macgraw she had very strong eyebrows and not a lot of makeup she was so natural she was a beauty icon then i moved to new york and girls from all over the world were modeling the models started looking differently they were mixed nationality things changed style has definitely evolved girls can walk in with green hair piercings — it’s honestly about individuality and i like thatif you started your makeup line today versus in the s would it be differentit would be  percent different it would be a lot smaller my original idea was to have a really simple line because it was so successful we had many opportunities and requests and it grew really big it would probably be quite different if i started todaydo you think it would still revolve around the concept of nomakeup makeupwell thats what i wanted it to be but that’s not really what it ended up being it was really about individual beauty i think that when and if i ever go back in the cosmetics industry it will definitely be my original concept which is simplifying beautydo you think the concept of nomakeup makeup has evolvedi do i think that a lot of companies and makeup people have “nude” makeup in their line it’s not nude it’s like beige so it kind of takes the color out of people’s skin so for me nude makeup is actually the color of people’s skin whether you’re african american or you’re white or asian you have certain colors in your skin and if you take all the color away that’s not nude that’s kind of beige makeupi think it’s what colors you choose from each line because we all have different skin colors we have different skin conditions so it really just depends the end result has to look like you’re not wearing a lot of makeup but just that you’re vibrantly healthy hopefully if you are vibrantly healthy and you take care of yourself makeup is not that difficultthe youtube beauty community has really changed the entire landscape of the industry — especially during the past few years how do you feel about iti think it’s fascinating i think it’s interesting i think some of it is just like a car wreck where you just can’t believe it there’s some really talented teenagers that are doing these things to themselves it’s crazy but i personally like the way they look without makeup better than when they’re all done up but it’s fascinating to watch i don’t have that kind of talent i can’t do that so i respect everyone that doeswould you ever start a youtube channeli’ve always done videos both when i was at bobbi brown cosmetics and when i was a yahoo beauty i just started doing then again not tied to a makeup line and i think it’s definitely a place i want to be i like to teachdo you have any favorite youtubersbesides michelle phan there’s not one particular one that i watch i’m much more of an instagrammer beauty is boring is one of my favorite sites i actually got to work with her when i was at yahoo i’m always reaching out to people i like on instagram and doing things with them there’s some really talented people out thereyour own brand has been very inclusive in terms skin tones from the very beginning how well do you think other brands have progressed in terms of thati think it’s gotten a lot better the reason it’s gotten better is a lot of marketing and sales people realize that it’s important to the business but i think the essence of it is that i don’t want a woman to come up to the counter and not find a color of her no matter what the range whether it’s lips or cheeks i want the darkest of women to have a foundation that matches their skinwhats the biggest change youd like to see in the beauty industryi’m really not feeling contour i honestly don’t think people need contour and i think that young girls should feel beautiful as they are without makeup i’m not saying not to wear makeup but go both ways i love the way you look but i also bet you look great without makeupi think it’s about being comfortable in your skinany makeup look you’ve done on yourself that you regretso many and luckily it washes off i regret taking my eyebrows off when it was popular and making them very thin back in the ‘s as far as makeup i look terrible with a red lip i’ve tried i don’t look good with a real smoky eye i’m just someone that looks better with more natural makeupi think i’ve always been really interested in makeup and what it does though i was the person who was the only makeup artist in the room who would take a taupe eye pencil and put it on my lips to see what happens to it i would just try things i think i was always more of an entrepreneur than a transformer i wanted to see what it was like i lined my eyes once with a black mascara you know what happened bobbi brown gel linermore on bobbi brownbobbi browns
