lazardnet mutual funds – closedend funds lazard world dividend  income fund the lazard world dividend  income fund is a closedend management company that seeks total return through a combination of dividends income and capital appreciation the fund will pursue this objective through a world equity strategy and a shortterm emerging markets and debt strategy the fund will invest substantially all of its net assets in between  to  world equity securities that are financially productive and high dividend yielding it seeks to enhance income through exposure to shortterm emerging market forward currency contracts and other emerging markets debt instruments limited to  or less of the fund’s total leveraged assets which will provide exposure to emerging market currencies these two strategies are complementary with historically low correlation to one another which may reduce volatility there can be no assurance that the fund will meet its investment objective potential for portfolio diversification for portfolios primarily invested in us assets diversification by investing in historically low correlation assets such as nonus stocks and emerging market currency and debt instruments may reduce volatility and overall risk which may in turn enhance return lazard world dividend  income fund’s world equity strategy will be broadly diversified consisting of us and international equity securities in both developed and emerging markets securities also span industry sectors and the capitalization spectrum investing in small medium and largecap securities the fund’s emerging market currency and debt strategy will also be broadly diversified across countries and regions offering the potential for portfolio diversification with the possibility of credit and duration protection and limited interestrate sensitivity why dividends matter while the fund’s equity investments are not chosen for yield alone they will generally include the highest dividendyielding stocks on lazard’s equity platform as well as a selection of stocks that may potentially have significant dividend growth this is important because typically dividends are real earnings not hopedfor earnings based on the potential future growth of a stock they also offer the potential for stable income the  tax bill significantly lowered the us tax rate on qualified dividend income of us taxpayers there is no assurance as to what portion of the fund’s income if any will consist of qualified dividend income unique leveraging strategy the fund’s unique leveraging strategy allows greater flexibility risk management and economic efficiency to enhance the income potential for investors the fund intends to employ financial leverage initially up to approximately   of total assets by investing in forward currency contracts andor borrowings leveraged assets will be used for investing in emerging market currency or debt instruments it should be noted though that the lazard world dividend  income fund does not seek to profit from utilizing a leveraged spreadplay that is to say the fund is not borrowing at the shortend of the yield curve in order to invest at the longerend of the yield curve and profit from the spread on the contrary the leveraged portion of the lazard world dividend  income fund invests in very short duration instruments typically less than months and instead seeks to profit from accessing the high yields available in emerging market local currency debt using leverage is a speculative investment technique and involves certain risks anticipated asset allocation and emerging income leverage investing around the world today the world’s nonus countries provide  of the world’s stock market capitalization and  of the world’s gdp a broad universe of investment opportunities to optimize a us portfolio for a portfolio of primarily us assets investments in other low or uncorrelated assets such as nonus stocks and emerging market

involves certain risks these include higher volatility of net asset value and possibly more volatility in the market value of common stock of the fund the potential that the fund’s return will fall if the interest rate on any borrowings rises and income levels may fluctuate if the interest rate of borrowings varies the management fee may be higher as a result of leverage because it will be calculated on a basis that includes the leverage used it should be noted though that the lazard world dividend  income fund does not seek to profit from utilizing a leveraged spreadplay that is to say the fund is not borrowing at the shortend of the yield curve in order to invest at the longerend of the yield curve and profit from the spread on the contrary the leveraged portion of the lazard world

active management over the past  years which shows that it is possible to earn high riskadjusted returns by purchasing emerging market forward currency contracts and debt instruments while diversifying currency devaluation risk both within each region and across regions defined as latin america central and eastern europe africa the middle east africa and asia the key is that historically correlations between emerging market forward currency contracts and debt instruments are very low hence the diversification benefits on a portfolio level are significant the strategy is predicated on two assumptions first that correlations between currency movements are low enough to make diversification efficient and second that the returns are high enough to compensate for the risks historical data have supported both assumptions an investor should consult the prospectus for a complete discussion of the associated risks how are shares of lazard world dividend  income fund
