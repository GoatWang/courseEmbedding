centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do
