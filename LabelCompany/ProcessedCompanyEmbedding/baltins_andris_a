letters  about the author andris a baltins minneapolis minnesota excerpts reviews  interviews author contact grief resources home about the author andris a baltins these  stories evolved from a homework assignment of sorts after nancys death the facilitator in one of my grief groups suggested that each participant write a lettera grief letterto the deceased the letter said the facilitator was intended to finish unfinished business i didnt think there was much unfinished business between nancy and me id known nancy since we were eight years old at kenwood grade school in minneapolis nancy claimed she already knew in third grade that we were destined to spend our lives together we were married shortly after i graduated from yale she from smith college while i was in law school and she at the school of social work at the university of minnesota since nancy was a therapist and a spiritual director we were in the habit of processing a lot of stuff i didnt think i needed to write a letter to deal with unprocessed emotions but im a compliant student i had a homework assignment i wrote my first letter aboard a flight to boston for a business meetingwhen not writing letters to bridge the space between this world and the other world i practice business law and sit on a number of public private and nonprofit boards the rest of the letters were written in the study of katagiri roshi the former head teacher of the minnesota zen center who died a few years before nancy the space was imbued with the quiet of practitioners who had been sitting zazenmeditation practiceearlier in the morning the letters to nancy poured out one after another during a sixmonth sabbatical from lawyering i guess there was some unfinished business after all nancy died shortly before our twentyeight wedding anniversary we have two children i continue living in minneapolis i continue lawyering i continue writing and i continue loving nancy sitemap  contact  home copyright     andris a
