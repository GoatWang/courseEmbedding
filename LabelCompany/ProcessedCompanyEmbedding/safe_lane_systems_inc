estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   stock based compensation the company accounts for sharebased payments pursuant to asc  “stock compensation” and accordingly the company records compensation expense for sharebased awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options and restricted stock awards using the blackscholes option pricing model   stock compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the vesting period of the award or expensed immediately under asc  and eitf  when options are given for previous service without further recourse the company issued stock options to contractors that had been providing services to the company upon their termination of services under asc  and

  going concern and managements’ plans   as shown in the accompanying financial statements for the period ended june   the company has a limited operating history   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to do so  the financial statements do not include any adjustment to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   the company has a plan in place to remove this threat through the issuance of notes payable and common stocks offerings  if the offering raises at least  then the company’s estimated expenses related to the offering and the expenses related to initial projected operating costs of the company will be covered however the company will need to generate more than the expenses of the offering in order to have enough capital to execute its business plan            recent accounting pronouncements   the company has reviewed all recently
