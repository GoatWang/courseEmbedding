et share edgar online via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto overview nature of our business dennys corporation dennys is one of americas largest franchised fullservice restaurant chains dennys through its whollyowned subsidiary dennys inc owns and operates the dennys brand at december   the dennys brand consisted of  franchised licensed and company operated restaurants of this amount  of our restaurants were franchised or licensed representing  of the total restaurants and  were company operated our revenues are derived primarily from two sources the sale of food and beverages at our company restaurants and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the dennys name sales and customer traffic at both company and franchised restaurants are affected by the success of our marketing campaigns new product introductions product quality enhancements customer service and menu pricing as well as external factors including competition economic conditions affecting consumer spending and changes in guests tastes and preferences sales at company restaurants and royalty income from franchise restaurants are also impacted by the opening of new restaurants the closing of existing restaurants the sale of company restaurants to franchisees and the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees our operating costs are exposed to volatility in two main areas payroll and benefit costs and product costs the volatility of payroll and benefit costs results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses such as medical benefit costs and workers compensation costs additionally changes in guest counts and investments in storelevel labor impact payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are therefore subject to price volatility this volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable in general we purchase food products based on market prices or we set firm prices in purchase agreements with our vendors in an inflationary commodity environment our ability to lock in prices on certain key commodities is imperative to controlling food costs in addition our continued success with menu management helps us offer menu items that provide a compelling value to our customers while maintaining attractive product costs and profitability  summary of operations during  we achieved domestic systemwide samestores sales growth of  comprised of a  increase at company restaurants and a  increase at domestic franchised restaurants in addition to growing systemwide samestore sales in  of the past  quarters dennys achieved its sixth consecutive year of positive systemwide samestore sales a total of  remodels were completed during  comprised of  at company restaurants and  at franchised restaurants these remodels were in our heritage image which we launched late in  this updated look reflects a more contemporary diner feel to further reinforce our americas diner positioning we anticipate over  remodels will be completed systemwide in  by the end of  we expect  of the system will have been remodeled to the most current image during  we implemented a new franchise agreement which included a royalty rate of  and an advertising contribution of  excluding any incentives there were approximately  franchised restaurants  operating under this agreement as of december   and we expect there to be approximately  franchised restaurants  operating under this agreement by the end of  we anticipate that existing franchisees will elect to migrate to the new fee structure over the next decade as incentives under previous franchise agreements expire due to the longterm migration of existing franchisees we will not see the full benefit of the higher royalty rate for some time for  our average domestic royalty rate was approximately  during  our board of directors approved the termination and liquidation of the advantica pension plan the pension plan during  we completed the liquidation of the pension plan accordingly we made a final contribution of  million to the pension plan and recognized a settlement loss of  million reflecting the recognition of unamortized actuarial losses that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result operating income decreased  million to  million in  from  million in  net income decreased  million to  million or  per diluted share in  compared to  million or  per diluted share in  growing the brand over the last five years our growth initiatives have led to  new restaurant openings during  we had net restaurant growth of  restaurants with  openings and  closures our openings included  franchised international locations including four in canada three in mexico two in honduras two in the philippines one in the united arab emirates one in trinidad and one in puerto rico our goal is to increase net restaurant growth through all avenues balancing the use of cash we are focused on balancing the use of cash between reinvesting in our base of company restaurants growing and strengthening the brand and returning cash to shareholders during  cash capital expenditures were  million comprised of  million in capital expenditures and restaurants acquisition costs of  million the capital expenditures included approximately  million allocated towards the remodel of  company restaurants the restaurant acquisition costs include  million for ten highvolume franchised restaurants and  million related to a franchised restaurant that was acquired during  in november  as part of our previously authorized share repurchase programs we entered into a variable term capped accelerated share repurchase the  asr agreement with mufg securities emea plc mufg to repurchase an aggregate of  million of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the  asr agreement we paid  million in cash received approximately  million shares of our common stock which represents the minimum shares to be delivered based on the cap price and recorded  million of treasury stock related to these shares the remaining balance of  million is included as additional paidin capital in shareholders equity as of december   as an equity forward contract the total aggregate number of shares of our common stock repurchased pursuant to the asr agreement will be based generally on the average of the daily volumeweighted average prices of our common stock less a fixed discount over the term of the  asr agreement subject to a minimum number of shares subsequent to the year ended december   we settled the  asr agreement see note  to our consolidated financial statements during  including shares repurchased under the  asr we repurchased a total of  million shares for  million in addition we recorded  million shares and  million in treasury stock as a result of settling the  asr since initiating our share repurchase programs in november  we have repurchased a total of  million shares of our common stock for  million as of december   there was  million remaining under the current repurchase program factors impacting comparability for   and  the following items impacted the comparability of our results company restaurant sales have increased from  million in  to  million in  primarily as a result of the increase in samestore sales and acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees royalty income which is included as a component of franchise and license revenue has increased from  million in  to  million in  primarily as a result of the increase in samestore sales and a higher royalty rate initial franchise fees included as a component of franchise and license revenue are generally recognized in the period in which a restaurant is sold to a franchisee or when a new restaurant is opened these initial fees are completely dependent on the number of restaurants sold to or opened by franchisees during a particular period and as a result can cause fluctuations in our total franchise and license revenue from year to year occupancy revenues also included as a component of franchise and license revenue result from leasing or subleasing restaurants to franchisees when restaurants are sold and leased or subleased to franchisees the occupancy costs related to these restaurants move from costs of company restaurant sales to costs of franchise and license revenue to match the related occupancy revenue as leases or subleases with franchisees expire franchise occupancy revenue and costs could decrease if franchisees enter into direct leases with landlords at the end of  we had  franchise restaurants that are leased or subleased from dennys our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in december as a result a fiftythird week is added to a fiscal year every five or six years we had a  week year in  and  and a  week year in  which impacts the comparison of our financial information we estimate that the additional  operating week added approximately  million of company restaurant sales and  million of franchise and license
