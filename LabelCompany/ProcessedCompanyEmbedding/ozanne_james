ozanne is letting laird off the hook  james timbers jun   i can hardly believe the incredible weakness of dane county district attorney ismael ozannehe was handed a felony conviction on a silver platter and still cannot do his job his weakness and racism amounts to making genele lairds behavior at east towne mall acceptable in our society ozanne is quoted that in light of the attention the case has received he supported this outcome a little bad press from the uninformed public and ozanne is willing to sell our safety the real kicker is he believes laird has accepted responsibility for her actions i have yet to see any such statement from her let alone an apology to those she assaulted if im at the mall in broad daylight and someone threatens my life and pulls a knife it may be time
