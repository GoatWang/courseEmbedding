clicking in hopefully either we are currently engaged in or about to begin a business relationship before i do that however i would like to tell you a little about myself and my company as you may or may not have read this family business has been around in some form since  originally my great uncle john aiello ventured north from new york city about  getting accustomed to the landscape he sent for his brother my grandfather and the original joe aiello who’s the joseph aiello of joseph aiello  sons and in  they set up john aiello  brother the original aiello produce company as both families grew john’s sons one being tragically killed and another opting for a more scholarly profession did not succeed their father while joseph’s sons my father and uncle took up the profession my uncle a george aiello who passed in  could regale you with great colorful stories about the “olden days” in the produce business he would recall with great detail about how they used to deliver fresh vegetables with horse and wagon he had very vivid dreams maybe sometimes nightmares about loads of strawberries cantaloupes and iceberg lettuce which by the way received its moniker from the mountains of ice they used to load on top of the product when it was placed in railcars sorry to say however that with the passing of the “boys” in the early part of the decade all that is left is nostalgia the stories were far livelier when the two “sons” were together thus the “roots” no pun intended were planted very deep for the third generation of aiello’s to break into the business with good labor always at a premium i was recruited early and often as a young man being on the loading docks at the age of  my father and uncle were always very proud of my academic accomplishments first at st catherine of siena school then at christian brothers academy and encouraged me very openly to choose another life than the one they had lead yet during all this encouragement the “boys” would readily recall all the good times they had working together the various characters they met and employed over the years and the advantages to their own health in being surrounded by a plethora of fresh fruit and vegetables thus after  years at colgate university where i was awarded a bachelor of arts in history i came back out of loyalty to both my father and uncle and to help them as they struggled with the plight of tackling the day to day challenges of business so here i am today scribing this introductory piece for our company website it is hard to imagine that i can speak simultaneously to a variety of people using this mass of silicon and optic wiring when only about  years ago we were using horse drawn carriages to transfer product between our warehouse and your establishment i hope to continue to embrace all the new technology available and maybe some day one of my sons will use this space to project live images of strawberries being received and shipped or iceberg lettuce as it arrives at our distribution center there are days however when i wonder if it would be the right thing to do to encourage a fourth generation if you could ask my great uncle john and my grandfather joseph if they could have imagined their success four generations later i wonder what they would say joseph j aiello jr president joseph aiello  sons  ps if you would like to gather further insight into my life including hobbies interests and loyalties please feel free to email me  jaielloaielloscom i am fairly well read on subjects such as nutrition politics sports business including marketing and investments and i make it a priority to attend the saratoga thoroughbredracing meet you can also catch me on the various squash courts around the area as not only do i sell squash but also play it as well sometimes i get confused ja      dongan avenue albany ny    copyright  by aiello  sons  dongan avenue albany ny   website design albany ny wwwgroupieheadcom   john aiello  abebooks abebookscom

lsw firmware update audio products darwinosx darwinosx   utc  the os x firmware is out i updated with no issues kef ls wireless  roon ready johnaiello john aiello   utc  link where can we find it is t the same as the windows version that was released a few weeks ago ratbert   utc  mac link jnanroon jnaneshwar   utc  i saw this but did not know how to update the firmware for mac version is there a link regarding how to ratbert   utc  its in the download just click on the mac link and read the pdf jimmykl   utc  i wish they would document features more clearly i cant figure out how to disable the autostandby time even though it was added in this update and i randomly found out in the comments section of a review that you can change the sleep timeout to min by holding down the deskstand button until the lights blink but no sign of that in any kef documents ive seen the ability to turn off the startupshutdown strum sound would be a good feature too darwinos   utc  i found how to configure out how to configure auto standby by looking at the faqs for the speaker odd place to put it but thats where it is they must have just added it in darwinos   utc  the windows version has not been updated yet so i dont think they are the same darwinos   utc  attached some screen shots to show update versions and how to adjust autostandby untitled jpegx  kb untitled jpegx  kb disablejpegx  kb osss   utc  thanks hard to find intel indeed darwinos   utc  i just got an email from kef saying there is an update for the speakers i noticed both updates are dated may nd even though the mac one just came out johnaiello john aiello   utc  i got the same email i am guessing that its not a new update but i will probably try it this weekend osss   utc  nope its not according to this link thanks ratbert the latest firmaware update is this one date maymcu vwifi dsp  johnaiello john aiello   utc  okay i just tried the update and its the same version as are installed my my speakers from the last update so nothing new here i think though the thing i missed about this is that the mac updater is now wireless it seems to me when i did the last update via a windows laptop i had to connect the speaker to the laptop via usb this is  times better darwinos   utc  we dont know for sure the os x and windows update are the samethey have the same date for both and we know the mac version just came outthe release notes are so minimal as to tell us practically nothingjust saying its the same point version doesnt mean its the exact same code they can give it whatever number they wanti didnt notice the mac version as wireless the directions said to do it by usb cable and turn on wireless but the update looks like it took place over usb and wireless was too be turned on to make sure that component was updated that was my assumption anywayanyway im glad to see it finally had some sort of update along with the ios appmy next step is to connect a microrendu to mine for roonim also getting some isoacoustic stands and maybe higher end power cords johnaiello john aiello   utc  when i tried the update the updater said the version on my speakers was the same as the one in the updater so i did not do it not sure what you mean about the directions needing usb it is  wireless on a mac i was able to access the speakers without a usb cable connected darwinosx darwinosx   utc  im saying the directions say to connect directly to the speakers via usb and also select wifi as the sourceon another note i changed auto standby to  minutes which worked st first but now they just stay on all the time nice work kef still issues with the speakers retaining settings i would email them but there never seems to be a reply johnaiello john aiello   utc  are you using windows or a mac when i did the update via windows it was via usb when i tried it via the mac it was wireless darwinosx darwinosx   utc  macintosh johnaiello john aiello   utc  well then all you did was read the directions because the updater is wireless next page → audio products  roon labs community log in audio products about the audio products category audio products  roon tested audio hardware formerly
