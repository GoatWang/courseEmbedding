states and the district of columbia it had over  million attendees and has theaters in all of the top  us designated market areas the movie theater industry is highly competitive due to the large number of players and the lack of control theater companies have on suppliers in addition regal entertainments movie theaters must compete with inhome theater services television movie providers and other forms of entertainment such as sporting events and music concerts to combat such competition regal entertainment and other theater chains such as amc entertainment and cinemark usa have moved to the megaplex theater format today regal entertainment has an average screentheater ratio of  which is about twice the industry average by providing a centralized location for multiple screens regal capitalizes on economies of scale by minimizing labor and concession costs regal entertainment’s revenues are directly tied to the success of the films that its theaters show regal entertainment’s value is also contingent upon the financial wellbeing of national cinemedia inc the largest digital intheater advertising network in the us regal holds a  interest in the advertising firm and ncm’s

experience  competition  how is regal entertainment different  how is regal entertainment similar  notes business overview geographic breakdown regal entertainment operates in  states and washington dc the company has locations in the top  us designated markets and  of the top  regal specifically targets midsized metropolitan areas and highgrowth suburbs of large metropolitan areas as locations for acquisition or development financials theater chains have compensated for declining movie attendance in recent years by increasing ticket and concession prices this has been successful in keeping revenues steady as regal entertainments revenues have continued to climb in the  range over the past  years revenues come predominantly from ticket and concession sales and in  regal posted total revenues of  billion compared to its  revenue of  billion as a result of this increase in revenues regals net income increased as well for  regal had total net income of  million compared to the previous years  million trends and forces regals revenues rely on the popularity of films a movie theater companys success is tied closely to the quality of the films that it shows for example in  the movie film industry produced multiple hits including avatar transformers revenge of the fallen harry potter and the halfblood prince up twilight saga new moon the hangover among others as a result for the first time ever us box office revenues were more than  billion as a result  attendance volume increased by over  resulting in gains in revenue as well as net income success of national cinemedia inc impacts regal entertainment regal entertainment has a  interest in national cinemedia inc the largest digital intheater advertising network in the us ncm ipoed in  selling  million shares of common stock for  per share despite the selling of shares to the public regal entertainment retained its position as the largest corporate investor in ncm more than amc entertainment and cinemark usa regal entertainment has contractual agreements with ncm that will impact regal entertainments revenues in the future for instance ncm pays regal entertainment an  per digital theater and  per patron access fee rising movie prices will add revenues per ticket but may drive away customers the prices of movie tickets and concession items have been rising dramatically this may be to compensate for declining ticket sales and other revenuegenerating factors the price increases are also due to higher transportation costs due to rising oil prices pressure to remain competitive in the industry and rising inflationary pressures ticket price increases have offset revenuelosses due to declining attendance however too much of a price increase will cause attendance to decline to the point of revenue losses digitization of theaters will improve the moviegoing experience one of the primary ways that regal entertainment and other industry leaders are attempting to corner larger market share is through investment in digital projection theaters regal entertainment will begin digitizing its theaters in the second quarter of  two new theaters have already successfully been built with digital projection capabilities and regal entertainment hopes to be finished upgrading to digital technology within three to four years to finance this investment regal entertainment amc entertainment and cinemark usa have set up a joint venture called digital cinema implementation partners llc dcip is still in the process of finalizing finance plans regal entertainment sees the upgrade to digital projection theaters as a growth opportunity through both increased quality and the compatibility of digital projection with d and imax format movies since both amc entertainment and cinemark are also upgrading theaters installing digital theaters is a capital expense that will not differentiate regal entertainments brand from others though the investment will not provide additional value from an enhanced product it will keep regal entertainment competitive thus protecting against a deterioration of market value competition regal entertainment along with other theater chains faces substantial competition from other theater chains inhome movie services television movie providers and from other forms of entertainment because the theater industry is so competitive individual theater companies have little influence over suppliers the movie theater industry is topheavy the largest  companies regal entertainment amc entertainment cinemark usa carmike cinemas and national amusements control  of the market share while the next  only control  national amusements is a private company how is regal entertainment different as the largest theater chain regal entertainment operates with the greatest economies of scale and thus the highest operating margins of any theater company how is regal entertainment similar below the largest companies the movie theater industry is fragmented and highly competitive few barriers to entry exist and studies have shown that consumers are not loyal to a particular company instead moviegoers base their decisions off of proximity the films showing and amenities for this reason the movie theater industry lacks expansion opportunities especially in the growth of internal operations regal entertainments growth potential lies primarily through
