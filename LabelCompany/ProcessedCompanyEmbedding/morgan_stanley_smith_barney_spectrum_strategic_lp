futures interests trading accounts established for each trading advisor such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the partnerships trading the assets are held either in noninterest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the cftc for investment of customer segregated or secured funds since the partnerships sole purpose is to trade futures interests it is expected that the partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes the partnerships investment in futures interests may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single trading day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way capital resources the partnership does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets the partnerships only assets are its i investments in the funds ii interest receivable and iii cash at bank redemptions of units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures interests in subsequent periods it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future outflows of units there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time results of operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisors and the ability of each trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forwards and options markets aventis trades its aventis diversified commodity strategy formerly the barbarian program on behalf of the partnership the aventis diversified commodity strategy is based on an ensemble of three discretionary subprograms pgr trades its pgr mayfair investment program formerly the pgr mayfair program on behalf of the partnership pgrs futures investment program seeks to profit over the medium term by exploiting inefficiencies in futures and forward markets across a broad range of asset classes and geographic regions proprietary models developed by the founding partners are implemented in an inhouse trading system which systematically processes realtime data and executes trades automatically on electronic future exchanges and foreign exchange trading platforms prior to its termination on january   blenheim traded its global markets strategy  futuresfx on behalf of the partnership the objective of the global markets strategy was to capture substantial profits through the establishment of risk controlled strategic investment positions in markets where blenheim had identified an unsustainable level of market disequilibrium that had not been reflected in the current market price the essence of blenheims trading approach was its ability to use discretion in formulating the most effective mix of trading methodologies investment vehicles and markets to maintain performance objectives as trading opportunities were identified blenheim analyzed potential trading applications in order to achieve maximum capital appreciation with prudent risk management procedures the following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the partnerships net assets allocated to each trading advisor for the periods ended december   and september   respectively and the change during the applicable period allocation as of allocation as of allocation as of allocation as of change december  september  december  september  during the trading advisor         period  pgr        aventis      the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisors or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized gains losses on investment in bhm i llc pgr master fund and mb master fund respectively for open contracts and recorded as net realized gains losses on investment in bhm i llc pgr master fund and mb master fund respectively when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the fair value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees general partner fees ongoing placement agent fees incentive fees and brokerage fees of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts for the year ended december   the net asset value per unit decreased  from  to  for the year ended december   the net asset value per unit decreased  from  to  for

weather conditions in the us and brazil lowered crop estimates for an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of  trading results refer to the partnerships annual report to limited partners for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k the partnerships gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources market risk the partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of offbalance sheet market and credit risk the partnership trades futures contracts options on futures and forward contracts and forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity interests including but not limited to foreign currencies financial instruments metals energy and agricultural products in entering into these contracts the partnership is subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions such as interest rate volatility resulting in such contracts being less valuable if the markets should move against all of the positions held by the partnership at the same time and the trading advisors were unable to offset positions of the partnership the partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to  of their capital accounts in addition to the trading advisors internal controls the trading advisors must comply with the partnerships trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained the trading advisors and ceres monitor the partnerships trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and ceres can require the trading advisors to modify positions of the partnership if ceres believes they violate the partnerships trading policies credit risk in addition to market risk in entering into futures interests there is a credit risk to the partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the partnership the ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the partnership for futures forward and options contracts traded in the united states and most foreign exchanges on which the partnership trades is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange in general a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of nonperformance by one of its members or one of its members customers which should significantly reduce this credit risk there is no assurance that a clearinghouse exchange or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the partnership and ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the partnership against a default by such parties further the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the brokers customers in cases where the partnership trades off exchange forward contracts with a counterparty the sole recourse of the partnership will be the forward contracts counterparty ceres deals with these credit risks of the partnership in several ways first ceres monitors the partnerships credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis the commodity brokers inform the partnership as with all of their customers of the partnerships net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions and ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the partnerships potential net credit exposure exchange by exchange by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange if any to the partnerships margin liability thereon second the partnerships trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the partnerships trading usually over several different products and exchanges historically the partnerships exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and on those relatively few occasions where the partnerships credit exposure climbs above such level ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than  of units then outstanding third with respect to futures interests trading the partnership trades with only those counterparties which ceres together with msco has determined to be creditworthy the partnership presently deals with msco as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency forward contracts for additional information see note  financial instruments under notes to financial statements in the partnerships annual report to limited partners for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k inflation has not been a major factor in the partnerships operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the general partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period as a result actual results could differ from these estimates a summary of the partnerships significant accounting policies is described in note  to the partnerships financial statements included in item  financial statements and supplementary data the partnerships most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its investments in futures interests and us treasury bills as applicable the fair value of futures interests is determined by the various exchanges and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges the fair value of nonexchangetraded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options using as inputs the spot prices interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period us treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of futures interests the marketsensitive instruments held by the partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and as a result all or substantially all of the partnerships assets are at risk of trading loss unlike an operating company the risk of marketsensitive instruments is inherent to the primary
