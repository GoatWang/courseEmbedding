signup five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuels october  share this pagefacebooktwitterlinkedin click to view pdf version since fall  colleges churches and cities have been leading robust discussions and moving to divest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry inspired by these actions individual investors also have been moving their money out of coal oil and gas companies green century has nearly a decade of experience with fossil fuel free investing and more than two decades of success with shareholder advocacy this moment in history offers investors a unique opportunity to make a difference on climate change while saving for their future here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies  get your investments in line with your values climate change is a serious threat to our society and burning fossil fuels is a main cause of worsening floods droughts and wildfires many investors want to keep their investments away from the industry that is principally responsible for causing a changing climate divesting allows you to align your beliefs with your investment decisions – an alignment that is being increasingly sought by young and old alike  reduce corporate influence on energy policy fossil fuel companies have tremendous influence over legislation and regulations through lobbying in state capitols and congress for years this power has helped thwart progress on the policy solutions to climate change the fossil fuel divestment campaign is inspired by the successful south african divestment campaign and aims to exert similar pressure on the companies and institutions standing in the path of needed change  strengthen the climate movement climate change is so profound and the solutions so wideranging that it is often a challenge for people to find a way to make a powerful difference the divestment strategy is successfully engaging the public a coordinated and organized climate change network – that includes mayors church leaders and college students – is essential to passing needed energy policies  may reduce exposure to stranded carbon assets the fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal oil and gas that – if extracted and burned – will release five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe if governments restrict carbon emissions companies owning those fossil fuel reserves may not be able to extract and sell them the reserves may become stranded assets and investors may then be left with devalued assets divesting now could allow investors to reduce their exposure to a possible collapse of the socalled “carbon bubble”  reinvest in the solutions once divested from fossil fuels investors have the opportunity to invest in forwardlooking climate solutions like companies specializing in energy efficiency renewable energy or other related climate mitigation strategies to learn more visit greencenturycomfossilfuelfree or call green  the green century balanced fund is
