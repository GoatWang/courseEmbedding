fumbled passes in other words lots of failure and frustration having alligator arms is an ideal analogy for fearfully holding back rather than living life fully in do you have alligator arms moore explores what it means to let go of fear and purposefully embrace life commitment faith hope love god and others author bio▼▲ james w moore is a bestselling author of more than  books and an acclaimed
