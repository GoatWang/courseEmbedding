on the top line it got there through a  uptick in its online recruitment services a big deal since that accounts for  of its business other human resourcerelated revenue accounting for the other third of jobs business managed to grow  since the prior year  theres no longer a need to break out its print publishing business job ceased publication of job weekly  the weekly job listings that it would
