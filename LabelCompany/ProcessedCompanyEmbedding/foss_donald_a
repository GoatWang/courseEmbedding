operations special finance® on the lot with don foss march  fi and showroom  feature by tariq kamal print more than  years after he opened his first usedcar dealership in detroit don foss is still in the special finance game along the way he became the largest independent dealer in michigan and founded credit acceptance which has been buying subprime contracts since  special finance caught up with foss to learn his secrets for lasting success in subprime auto retail sf how did you get started in the car businessdf you could say i started small i bought an old tow truck and went around town buying and reselling junk cars eventually i was able to buy better cars and sell those — first out of my driveway then from my first lot in  sf was it your focus on the subprime market that allowed the business to grow and what led you to start credit acceptancedf well at that time those were really the only customers i had the business did grow and we were able to open a couple more lots but i began to realize that even as i worked as hard as i possibly could at selling cars we would have to do better on the collections side we decided to start the finance company in  the two people i put in charge were not all that experienced in finance but they were experienced in collections it worked out well for me — i could still be the friendly salesman on the lot and not have to turn around and play the mean collector the next week sf at what point were you able to offer your lending services to other dealersdf it was nine years before we took on another dealer — and before credit acceptance turned a profit by the way — but that wasn’t necessarily the plan i thought i would just be a big retailer but a friend of mine wanted to open a lot and he knew it was the financing that made it work for me it spread by wordofmouth from there sf did bringing on other dealers require special finance training as welldf absolutely we had to train our new dealers on process inventory … you have to understand that most dealers are trained to sell the customer on the car and its features the problem is that might not be the car that the customer can afford in special finance you’re selling the benefits of financing sf do you believe that’s the reason many dealers are wary of the subprime marketdf a lot of dealers will always ignore those customers now that creates a bigger market for me but what i hate to see is dealers who don’t show any respect for those customers sales guys may feel that if they can’t finance the customer they’re wasting their time but you really just have to match the customer to the right vehicle i’ve often said that if you’re telling the customer “you don’t have enough of a down payment you have to go get more money” you’re making a mistake even if they do manage to get more eight or nine months later making the payments has become a big problem sf having been in the business since the ’s you’ve been through several downturns what advice can you offer to other dealers to help them stay in business nowdf one secret to our survival is that we’ve always had very little debt we’ve managed our overhead well it’s so easy for a buyhere payhere dealer to sell himself into oblivion with credit acceptance we were at least always able to finance the lots the early ’s was as bad as i’ve ever seen it we had a banner up at that time that said “we buy cars bring your title” every day we would have a customer with his title wanting to sell his car because he was moving to texas the joke was “will the last person out of michigan please turn out the lights” but as rough as it got we were able to survive and thrive when things were at their worst and my friends would ask me “don what do you think is going to happen” i would just say “hey people still need cars when i see them walking down  mile road rather than driving i’ll start to worry”  request more info about this productservicecompany  request more info fill out the form

depthas no answers they havent finished their process of checking the car to see what they believe the problem is while i was waiting in negitive  degree weather in a car with no power and a  year oldthe roadside assistance man steve stated it was a valve cover casket bad altinator and bad power sterring pump my question is this if you are brand new to the neighborhood and somebody buys a car you did not inspect before selling and she has a problem of this size within  hours of purchase wouldnt you tell that customer that you will cover the repairs or split the cost with me this manager hasnt had a conversation with me yet i know the car was bought as is but the michigan law says i can have my money back which is all i want at this point and i have made clear my next step is to call the local news station and put jose and carite in the hall of shame  bob  may    am  ha ha  cory  september    am  unfortunately michigan law says no such thing with regards to buying a used car you buy ityou own it period  robert p  march    am  not to have consumer protection laws is not right especially when car loans from banks have to disclose all options in the car why does the dealer not have to disclose all issue with the car to banks it a federal offense to power book a car but it legal to sell a used car that breaks down the same day and has no recourse these types of laws are meant to protect only banks not consumerscarrite should be ashamed about this post since they have a mission statement says its all about the customers blah blah blah sounds like cac running a car
