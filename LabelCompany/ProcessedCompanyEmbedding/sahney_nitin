omnicare specialty care group a conversation with nitin sahney omnicare specialty care group may   since the 990s omnicare cincinnati has been one of the leading pharmacy supply services to the longterm care ltc market starting in the mids the company made a series of acquisitions and in november  unified them as the omnicare specialty care group scg nitin sahney who had founded one of the acquired companies rxcrossroads in  was appointed president of scg in  and recently became president and chief operating officer of omnicare   scg has five “platforms” for services to the biopharma industry brand support services supply chain solutions patient support services specialty pharmacy and end of life care the first three are offered on a feeforservice basis to manufacturers making scg a marketing support organization a specialty hub provider and a specialty distributor the latter two involve consigned pharmaceutical products some of which flow into the parent’s ltc business currently scg is growing at a  per year clip and reported revenue of about  billion in  representing more than a fifth of the parent company’s business   pharmaceutical commerce sat down with mr sahney to talk about specialty distribution the healthcare market and industry needs here’s what he had to say    omnicare specialty care group is made up of four businesses—pbm plus rxcrossroads excellerx and acs all of whom maintain their own identity how did these companies come together and how is it planned for them to work together going forward   little more than two years ago the specialty care group essentially did not exist instead it was a collection of five separate businesses that omnicare had acquired over the years each operating independently and unaware of any operating and strategic synergies that may have existed these businesses also lacked direction and the structure required to generate consistent operating improvements and sales results today the specialty care group is an integrated welloiled operating entity that is competing very well in the marketplace   we achieved this by laying a very solid foundation operationally and strategically by constructing a very good operational team and developed a brand new sales function what we did was to integrate these four entities into five distinct platforms you can notice these are five platforms four of them are pointed toward biopharmaceutical services that is brand support services supply chain patient support services and our specialty pharmacy business   three out of our five platforms are feeforservice which is very exciting for us and we feel there’s a lot of opportunity in that area in three of the five platforms the manufacturer owns the product so we do not have any inventory risk on the other two that are focused on dispensing to the patients our specialty pharmacy has been growing very robustly and we expect that to continue we want to be a fullservice commercialization partner for challenging products of today’s biopharma industry we also promise to provide the quickest possible access to patients for these specialty products   we’ve also made substantial capital investments in the past two years building or expanding two logistics centers in kentucky and opening another patientsupport call center last year specialty pharmacy is headquarted in orlando fl and is backed up by facilities in memphis louisville and philadelphia    how much overlap is there with omnicare’s main line of business which is focused strongly on the ltc market   we believe our specialty care group adds tremendous value to omnicare in addition to being closer to the manufacturer the business also diversifies omnicare’s payer mix with the substantial amount of ebitda now coming from nongovernment resources   within our scg business our focus remains on accelerating growth within our feeforservice business and we are actively developing new solutions for our biopharma clients our specialty pharmacy platform is also gaining traction through limited distribution networks one unique example is the drug xenazine ed note tetrabenazine a therapy for huntington’s disease marketed in the us by lundbeck where we have utilized our ltc footprint to become the exclusive provider of this product within the ltc channel we will continue to evaluate opportunities like this to better leverage our assets with both our businesses now under the leadership of one team we believe we are in a better position to do so now that both our businesses are in the single management team we are focused in a very standardized way on metrics and with the same sense of urgency that helped us construct the specialty care group our multiphase plan for our longterm care business is underway and we’ll focus on omnicare’s key differentiated services clinical operations and technology    brand support and supply chain solutions are focused very clearly on serving manufacturers what does omnicare do that differentiates it from other players in this market and what do these differentiators mean for your biopharma clients   we believe our specialty offering is very differentiated from our competitors due to the integrated nature of our services and that is resonating very well with our customers our structure allows us to provide a complete turnkey alternative for some of the manufacturers while we can handle selected services for our clients it is our integrated endtoend approach from sales support to dispensing where we can be a true partner with our pharma clients   one of the key differentiators is that we can represent a manufacturer so we’re out there to help them in the feeforservice business vs somebody else who may be offering a multitude of products for that therapeutic class this aligns us perfectly with the manufacturer we have an internal physician sales staff—of not insignificant size—that calls on physicians to help with accessing specialty pharmaceuticals and again due to the fact that we have the specialty pharmacy we are unique as we’re the only company to cross all these different platforms    how are the patient support services structured and delivered does omnicare specialty have an advantage in providing both supplier services and patient services   we try to make certain through the solutions that we develop for these branded products that we are engaging the patients and making them involved in their therapies and then we leverage our distribution expertise to deliver either to practitioners directly to patients directly or to make use of what we have in the institutional pharmacy side of our business—the footprint that we have nationally besides the specialty pharmacy network we have more than 0 institutional pharmacies serving  states the district of columbia and canada   patient support is two things one how do we create access to the products and get patients on therapy tools include a reimbursement support program and hub access services to address the barriers in the marketplace again we’re doing this on behalf of our manufacturing partners   two on the back side we want to make certain we maintain that patient on therapy through these tools such as compliance and persistency copay support programs and ultimately the distribution with the product the end result is we want to make certain that the patient remains on therapy and mitigate any of the challenges that are in the marketplace today    what is the nearterm outlook for scg   since our specialty care group was formed in late  we laid a foundation for significant growth we invested in our operations and infrastructure including building a new sales force for the last eight quarters we’ve seen this performance show itself in doubledigit revenue and ebitda growth   while i’ll tell you that we don’t believe that we can continue to grow at the  to  rates we’ve seen thus far we do believe that this is a doubledigit longterm growth story for two reasons   first the industry grows in the high single digits we have already seen significant increases in specialty molecule drugs over the last several years and that will continue into the future if you look at today’s pipeline there is a saturation of traditional drugs in the marketplace but we see continued increases in the pipeline of specialty drugs today there are more than 9 specialty products in the current pipeline   secondly the number of drugs that we have in our business today is very small relative to the number of drugs in the marketplace and the growth that’s coming there are good opportunities ahead for us as the market has yet to mature in our view we will continue to enhance our structure where warranted adding key talent to further our credibility with our biopharma clients we will also look to penetrate additional disease states to open up markets in underserved therapeutic states like orphan drugs we also will look at ways to leverage both the scg and ltc assets collectively especially with both businesses now being under one management team taken together we believe our specialty care group is well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities    as you put yourself in your pharma customers’ shoes what are the big problems or challenges to be overcome in today’s healthcare market what would you advise pharma companies to do to meet them   from a market dynamics challenge we’re in an interesting time right now in that specialty pharmacy and specialty products are taking a larger segment from a cost standpoint so we’re seeing the payers come forward with a number of initiatives to help control and contain costs leveraging tools such as prior authorization and step added therapies to contain costs and barriers to access   at the top of the list of challenges are growing healthcare price and budget pressures followed by the growing need to demonstrate cost effectiveness this not only impacts fda approval but also can have implications to reimbursement and coverage   from the governmental side the patient protection and affordable care act is going to create more complexity in this marketplace it will challenge consumers with how they are going to obtain insurance we believe there’ll be an increase in the number of underinsured individuals creating an opportunity for us to help support these patients as they try to access complex therapies   finally there’s just the unique nature of the products that are coming to market whether they’re coldchain limited distribution or orphan drugs for small patient populations supply chain challenges and developing the appropriate strategy to get products to market are causing biopharma to really look beyond a traditional marketing and channel management strategy and to execution of specialty services and specialty distribution   payer actions like restricted access step edits prior authorizations and the like are understandable scrutiny of high prices for specialty drugs is warranted at the same time i worry that payers are not paying enough attention to the overall cost of healthcare restricted access to new therapies can mean higher hospitalization costs and lower quality of life look at how the scene has changed for multiple sclerosis with multiple therapies available now that vastly improve the quality of life we remain on the side of the manufacturer in these regards new medications can lessen overall patient cost and reduce human suffering    looking back to your early days in the industry—and looking ahead at the prospects for scg how has all of this affected you personally   i’m an entrepreneur at heart when i first came to the us from india i had wonderful opportunities to learn working at a home infusion company and then at a major wholesaler—this was in the early 990s before wholesaling became so consolidated and before pbms i saw the need for patient support services as the pharmaceutical industry evolved and that led to the founding of rxcrossroads in  we started from scratch   after that company was sold to omnicare i left and spent considerable time back in india doing pro bono work and becoming more knowledgeable about the pharma industry there which is dominated by the generics makers by now i had a family with two daughters and they’ve spent considerable time in india as well   the india market is very dynamic and has a bright future logistics is the problem there—how to distribute drugs across a vast subcontinent with a population of  billion no cold chain few wellperforming supply chain services they’ll work that out over time the other point i would make is that specialty products have a future there in the past people believed that complex conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis are effects of developed western economies they’re not—they are universal problems specialty products will be needed   when i returned to omnicare i
