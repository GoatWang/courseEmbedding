of marvel entertainment in  and lucasfilm in fast forward to  which marks the first time that each of the acquired companies is releasing a film in the same year underscoring the central role they now play in the disney empirebut the acquisitions didnt always look like sure thingsthese deals were questioned by analysts on wall street including me said tuna amobi an analyst for sp capital iq but with the investors i speak to the perception is that the deals could be the best deals in the media space of all time pound for poundthe acquisitions are a big reason disneys stock price has more than quadrupled during igers tenure beyond that they kept disney from a fate that has befallen many a corporate giant that tried to live off its past success sears roebuck  co us steel eastman kodak pan am — the annals of american business are filled with companies that either failed or fell from their peaks because they didnt adapt to competition and changing technologyin the rare case of a company getting back on top it is usually rejuvenated by an outsider — like louis gerstner jr who revived a battered ibm in the s — rather than an insider like iger who had been at disney for nearly a decade before becoming chief executivelike many successful corporate leaders iger  decided early on to try to control events rather than react to them to be fearless as he put it in a recent interviewi just was built with an innate ability to not let fear guide me in how i run my life he said you can look at all the numbers in the world but at some point somebody … needs to dig down deep search his soul analyze or get in touch with his own or her own instinct and decideformer colleagues say iger possesses an expansive vision for disney and is daring enough to act on it he solicits opinions notes former disneyland international chairman jim cora but ultimately goes where his gut tells him to gofact file robert igers bio favorite disneyland ride and moreiger has not been infallible disneys liveaction studio business has had its share of misses including the disastrous lone ranger in  and its current disappointment tomorrowlandit also remains to be seen how igers million gamble last year to buy maker studios which produces lowcost videos for youtube will pay offstill if iger were to step aside tomorrow he would have left disney in far better shape than when he became chief executive iger is expected to retire in  when his contract expires and this year thomas staggs was named disneys chief operating officer making him the top internal candidate to become the next ceowhoever it is disneys next chief executive can be expected to face an entirely new set of challenges but its also likely that its next leader will be studying the iger playbookaiming for pixaremerging from the oct  board meeting iger began mapping out a possible purchase of pixar the next day he directed a small group of trusted advisors staggs among them to do more homework and he told them he planned to call jobsthe team wasnt sold on the idea but iger made the call anyway reaching jobs that afternoon as he drove home from disney headquarters in burbanki said steve ive got a crazy idea iger recallediger told jobs that he wanted to visit him to make a proposal but jobs insisted on knowing what was on igers mind right awayi hesitated i was kind of nervous because the last thing i wanted was for him to basically hang up on me iger said at first he struggled with how to articulate his pitchi figured i might as well just cut to the chase and i said you know — disney acquiring pixar and there was complete silence iger said my heart was racing and he said you know what its not the craziest idea in the worldiger said the importance of pixar to disneys future had become clear to him during opening ceremonies for hong kong disneyland in september  just a month before he became chief executive he noticed the many characters from pixar films featured in the kickoff parade but there was nothing from disneys recent animated movies whose latest characters werent popularit was a light bulb at a very high wattage iger recalledthe phone conversation with jobs eventually led to disneys purchase of pixar at a  premium to its stock price the deal which made the mercurial jobs disneys biggest shareholder was widely questioned by analysts who believed the price was too dear but the acquisition arguably saved disney animation from a long decline that had been punctuated by flops such as s treasure planet the animation units boxoffice prospects were quickly lifted and disney also netted pixars leaders john lasseter and ed catmullin an effort to convince the animation gurus that they could thrive at disney iger shared with them his own experience of working for a company that was acquiredin  disney bought capital cities and its abc tv network for  billion iger was president of the company having risen through the executive ranks for two decades such acquisitions often lead to executive departures but thendisney chairman eisner retained iger who was promoted to president and chief operating officer of disney in i was a living breathing example of how someone could not only survive an acquisition but thrive he saidand in the same way that he was given an opportunity at disney iger gave lasseter and catmull a big one too putting them in charge of disney animation the division has since released hits including frozen the topgrossing animated film of all timebuying pixar iger said was the single most important thing that has happened to me in the  years ive been in this joba film giantby most accounts disney is king of the hill in hollywood the worlds largest entertainment firm it owns television networks a film studio and growing theme park and consumer products businesses — all of which work together to get maximum mileage out of the companys stable of intellectual propertyalthough the financial performance of each disney division has improved under iger he has arguably made his biggest impact in film in  disney was fifth among the six major studios in domestic boxoffice receipts according to rentrak now its near the top in  disney was no  behind th century fox so far this year disney again is in second place trailing warner bros by a narrow margin despite having released fewer filmsthe difference the pixar and marvel acquisitions which have turbocharged walt disney studios providing the division with a slew of blockbuster franchises including cars and iron manthose films are exceedingly valuable to disney because theyve become a centerpiece of the companys strategy of integrating intellectual property throughout its five business unitsin disneys hands a movie like frozen which was released in november  can spin off cash years after it exits theaters the films merchandise sales for example were credited with helping boost the consumer products divisions operating income  in the quarter that ended march disney monetizes its content better than anyone else out there said scott krisiloff chief investment officer at avondale asset management they dont just sell you the movie ticket they sell you the figurine the theme park ticket they sell you on the experiencedisney generated  billion in profit last year dwarfing the earnings of rivals such as time warner viacom and st century fox comcast posted a bigger profit than disney in fiscal  but the bulk of that companys net income comes from its telecommunications businessiger has reaped his rewards for disneys success he was paid  million last year and he holds about  million shares of disney stock according to recent regulatory filings his stock holdings were worth more than  million as of fridaybut not everything iger has touched has turned to gold in  he put tv veteran rich ross in charge of the film studio three years later disney parted ways with ross after the release of john carter the poorly received scifi epic that resulted in a million writedown ross had also put lone ranger into productionbut after ross exit iger moved swiftly to correct course he brought in a veteran studio hand former warner bros president alan hornthat willingness to make a decisive move is also evident in igers approach to dealmaking iger said that when hes considering an acquisition he doesnt get caught up in whatifsits not that im a daredevil iger said but im just generally not a fearful person i dont conduct my life worrying about what could happen what may happenpivotal purchasesthe pixar deal may be the one that established igers acquisition bona fides but disney wouldnt be where it is today without the marvel and lucasfilm purchasesmarvel had long been a gleam in disneys eye the company had a stable of popular comic book characters such as iron man spiderman and wolverine and by the mids had found success releasing superhero movies with rival film studiosto get marvel disney would have to convince owner isaac perlmutter a sharpelbowed israeli american businessman that it was time to sellike was difficult to reach didnt engage very much and never came to hollywood iger saidiger eventually got on perlmutters schedule they would meet in june  at the inscrutable marvel executives offices in manhattaniger walked into perlmutters office by himself and told the story of buying pixar hammering on the opportunities it created iger also suggested that perlmutter telephone jobs who could share his experience of selling pixar to disneyi basically tried to convince him that i was a trustworthy guy — not only was my handshake good but id be a good steward of his people and the brand iger saidhe said that the billion deal was effectively clinched over dinner with their wives at an upper east side steakhouseunder disney marvel has released three films that have topped  billion at the box office the avengers iron man  and avengers age of ultronstar wars is nextas with the marvel deal disneys acquisition of lucasfilm — the producer of the scifi franchise — hinged on a pivotal meal iger and lucasfilm owner george lucas met for breakfast at walt disney worlds hollywood brown derby patterned after the longgone la eateries in  while both were in florida to unveil a new d star tours attractionigers pitch invoked the successes of marvel and pixar and drew a tantalizing response from lucas what he said to me was if there is anyone i want to sell to it is you iger recalledsix months later lucas rang him remember that breakfast iger recalled lucas sayingthe billion deal was announced in october  star wars the force awakens will be released dec  the first of several new films planned for the franchiseproducer brian grazer who has known iger for more than  years believes that the executives toughness — hes kind of black ops — has made him impervious to pressure but it is igers ability to connect personally with leaders like lucas that may be his secret weapon grazer saidall of these guys — beginning with steve jobs then ike perlmutter and george lucas — are the most discriminating founders when you are a founder you really look for vision and trust i think bob has that in the highest order grazer said that immediately gave him a competitive edgedigital futurelast week disney gathered reporters to show off a new line of toys called playmation aimed squarely at a demographic the company calls the digital generation iger didnt preside over the reveal — those duties fell to staggs marking the first time hes been given such responsibilities in his role as the companys no dressed in a trim gray suit staggs explained how playmation would showcase disney film franchises starting with avengerssince its inception the walt disney co has been about imagination innovation and storytelling he saidbut now more than ever digital innovation will be important to disneys future its almost certain that the big challenge for the next ceo of disney wont be animation or liveaction film as it was with iger but with the digital revolutionon this front established media conglomerates like disney are fighting hard to establish beachheads in areas where upstarts such as netflix and amazon have found quick success its a sea change that affects many areas of the company but especially television disneys most lucrative businessit also remains to be seen what will come of disneys purchase of maker a major digital bet that could end up costing disney as much as  million if the company meets certain goalsthe presumption of many is that these will be battles for staggs now seen as the internal frontrunner for the ceo job but his ascension is not preordained between now and  his leadership will be scrutinized by disneys board which will select the companys next leader the company could also eye an outsider for the jobstaggs seems to be cut from the same cloth as iger both are fitness buffs both are experienced in acquisitions staggs was involved in the capital citiesabc deal and are said by former colleagues such as cora to have a similar management stylehe listens to people he trusts those who work for him or those in other divisions of the company cora the former disneyland international chairman said of staggs he gathers opinions toosimilar or not iger who was made disneys chairman in  has set the bar high and his successor will have to contend with outsized expectations disneys successes have been so grand and so regular — it has delivered record net income earnings per share and revenue four fiscal years in a row — that wall street has become accustomed to home runsthats a heavy burden for any ceoiger in talking about the risk of acquisitions noted that the chief executive is always the one in the spotlightyes youre putting risk on a company he said but from a reputational

disney isn’t ready to completely reinvent the way it gets its movies and tv shows in front of audiences or merchandise in the hands of consumers but walt disney co chief bob iger has a few ideas in mind that could impact the company’s bottom line in the nottoodistant future “what’s next for disney are much more directtoconsumer product offerings” said iger during a discussion with variety coeditorinchief claudia eller at the dealmakers breakfast on wednesday “the question is how fast we bring that product to market and challenge business models that are so valuable to us today” what iger is considering are ways that disney can more directly interact with its consumers he gave examples of how people who see disney’s films are the customers of movie theaters not disney “the theater owners own the customer we don’t” iger said similarly consumers who purchase disneybranded merchandise do so at bigbox retailers like walmart and target not necessarily disney stores “they’re walmart customers not disney customers” iger said but that’s not to say that disney plans to get into the exhibition business to create a closer connection “we’re not going to go into the business of building movie theaters” iger said but it already has launched disney movies anywhere an app through which it is selling and storing digital copies of disney pixar and marvel films apple’s itunes google play and walmart’s vudu support the service at its theme parks it’s launched my magic plus a wristbandbased system through which guests can store fast passes for attractions and room keys when visiting walt disney world but also save credit cards through which they can purchase food and merchandise photosvariety’s dealmakers breakfast the overall idea is to find ways to better understand who disney’s customer is and customize experiences for them that could include online retail destinations built around “star wars” marvel’s superheroes or pixar’s properties that package publishing tv shows and films and offers access to those for a fee as disney focuses more attention on its brands “there are opportunities where we can use these brands and the affinity customers have with them to sell directly to them” iger said “long term for our company that’s what we’re concentrating on” iger singled out espn given the popularity of the sports network and its audience’s loyalty to the brand he noted how hbo is launching a standalone overthetop service to reach audiences who don’t want to pay for the cable channel through traditional methods espn has its own ott service in the works “we could do that in a second” iger said but “in doing so do we want to disrupt in an extreme way the multichannel subscription model that’s delivered to us so much profitability to our company for so long i don’t think we need to hasten that by not doing it now we don’t lose anything we can always do it” during the qa iger provided further insight into the future of disney’s various divisions including its studio tv networks and theme parks event held inside the palm restaurant at its new location in beverly hills presented by bank of america and sponsored by delta that included plans to add “star wars” attractions at its theme parks around the world driven by what will appear in future films the first of which is “star wars the force awakens” directed by jj abrams see more‘star wars’ theme park attractions based on new not old films on his decision to stay at disney through  in october iger extended his contract to remain chairman and ceo of the walt disney co through june   he will appoint a chief operating officer in  with the individual most likely groomed to replace iger when he does retire “it’s not the easiest thing in the world to walk away from” said iger of disney he dismissed any notions of wanting to run for public office a longtime rumor concerning iger’s plans after disney “i don’t think that would be fun” iger said “i know it wouldn’t pay as well” he joked while iger’s successor has yet to be named iger acknowledged that he’s working closely with disney’s board of directors on finding his replacement and planning a smooth transition for the next disney chief “there’s a time for anyone to step off the stage” iger said “i will have been ceo for  years that’s enough” on plans for new acquisitions after maker studios lucasfilm marvel and pixar “i don’t rule out a possibility for another large acquisition” iger said but noted that “there’s nothing imminent we don’t have strong strategic holes or deficits there’s no big need right now we’re fortunate as a company that we have an unbelievably strong balance sheet we have more than enough to do” recent acquisitions like maker studios lucasfilm marvel and pixar all fulfill a purpose at the company iger said and when it comes to future deals deals must flow through an “acquisition sieve” and provide the company with either new intellectual property that disney can build brands around or provide it with new forms of technology that disney can use to distribute its content or entertain its fanbase the impact technology has on entertainment conglomerates today “disruption is happening” iger said “there’s no question about it we’re seeing it more on the tv side than anywhere else” that disruption is largely happening through technology and the ability of consumers to access tv shows and movies on mobile platforms smart tvs videogame consoles and other devices which is impacting longstanding business models and revenue streams “just about anywhere you look there’s something happening that is shaking the foundation of the business model that’s shaped the underpinning of these great businesses” iger said with that said iger is upbeat on the prospects of what new technologies provide companies like disney “i like to look at this change as a glass half full versus a glass half empty” he said “you have to have a degree of optimism people don’t want to follow pessimists i can’t ignore the changes going on you have to admit the disruption taking place don’t be in denial about it don’t will it away embrace technology not push it away or deny its existence embrace technology every step of the way even in ways that disrupt our business” disney however finds itself in an enviable position given that “when you make great content you tend to be in demand by consumers and distribution platforms all over the world” iger said “if a new distribution platform emerges the first call they make is to disney” on the increase in entertainment options on new digital platforms “distribution isn’t a differentiator anymore” iger said “distribution is a commodity” which has forced streaming services and other online platforms to get into the original content game “content is still king” iger said “there’s just more of it” and that doesn’t surprise iger “there are many more ways you can get content distributed than ever before that’s a good thing” the bad side is that “there’s more content but not more fantastic content the quality hasn’t expanded as much as the content has expanded there are things to be said for things that are great” on the studio’s decision to make fewer movies under the reign of rich ross disney’s film studio produced fewer movies reducing the slate to around  a year over the last three years that figure will increase to  over the next three “it’s not about how much you make it’s about how good the quality is” iger said “you’ll be better off as a company making fewer things and concentrating on those and how you bring those to market … in a very less cluttered way even though the marketplace is more cluttered” why the studio makes movies like “million dollar arm” “million dollar arm” may have generated praise from critics but the  million film starring jon hamm as a baseball scout who recruits new players in india earned just  million earlier this year that film will be followed by another feelgood sports film in “mcfarland usa” with kevin costner in february “you can quickly lose  million on a  million movie these days” iger said “we need to be even more careful about them today than a couple years ago” but the point of making those nontentpoles at the studio is to produce what it calls “brand deposits” “we like making these kinds of movies” iger said “when people think of disney they think of a collection of experiences we want them to have positive thoughts about the brand” and profitability isn’t always necessarily the end goal on whether tv is a good business television is “not a high margin business as some of our other businesses are” iger said “it’s a perfectly fine business to be in” especially if a company can create the shows and own the network they are on “it helps a lot” overall cable is experiencing slower growth as new platforms compete for consumers’ time but iger still called it a good buy when it comes to branding abc family is said to be rethinking its image now that many of its series appeal to teen and tween girls rather than the entire family “over time the programming mandate was one that was aimed at young female adults” iger said with shows like “pretty little liars” iger said he would support any suggestion of a new way to brand the cable channel should the right strategy be developed how espn will compete with new players like fox sports “fox sports and the other challengers right now are all competing to be a distant no  because of the rights espn has managed to buy over the years” iger said noting that espn has spent considerable coin to lock down broadcast rights to nfl ncaa mlb and nba games “we made a very conscious decision to do that for competitive reasons we will buy the cream of the crop even if it costs a lot of money” iger said espn needed to in order to continue to grow the venerable sports brand but while it’s spent heavily on rights deals those pacts also include the necessary digital rights to enable espn to go directly to its audience and make the viewing experience more flexible and compelling to consumers iger said iger did note that the cost for sports rights is increasing due to increased competition but “there’s a misconception that rising costs are eating into espn’s profits” iger said “it’s not growing at the rate it used to grow but it’s continuing to grow and will continue to grow its profitability in the next five to ten years” on the move of marketing dollars to digital platforms iger showed some annoyance in the current state of advertising and how it’s impacting tv buy rates marketers are increasingly shifting their budgets to digital platforms considering that’s where more viewers are accessing entertainment “there are people in denial about this” iger said and called it “ridiculous” “of course there’s money that’s moved over we’ve moved it” the issue that needs to be solved is how to track which ads are viewed and on what digital platforms “there’s a strong sense that online is where the consumers are” iger said but a solution to measure that audience needs to be more robust he said “there’s a lot of money being invested in solving this” did disney kill the merger of hasbro and dreamworks animation iger adamantly denied reports that disney forced hasbro to back away from a merger with dreamworks animation given that the toymaker has licenses to produce playthings based on “star wars” marvel’s superheroes and now “frozen” and its popular disney princess line too which previously was handled by rival mattel “it’s absolutely not true” said iger who also stressed that disney is not looking to buy a toy company “we got way too much credit” however iger simply presented disney’s position on working with partners “you can be a good partner or you can be a bad partner” iger said cautioning that “we fully expect that given the size of our business at hasbro that they will behave as the licensee they were when we decided to do the deal and give more business to them” it was a very diplomatic way of saying a merger with dreamworks animation would have created a different kind of hasbro that may not have sat well with disney “if you choose to be a bad partner there can potentially be ramifications” iger said “there’s a difference in saying if you do that deal you’re dead we didn’t have to other people did it” filed under bob

specifically espn says steven birenberg of northlake capital the street is very skeptical the shanghai park represents a legacy play for iger which made recent comments by wang jianlin chairman of dalian wanda and chinas richest man especially irksome they shouldnt have entered china said wang who is launching his own parks we have a saying one tiger is no match for a pack of wolves disney has been attacked in the us this year as well for its use of the hb visa program which led to laidoff disney employees having to train their outsourced replacements and iger a democrat and hillary clinton supporter whom many believe has his own political aspirations got into a public spat with bernie sanders via facebook of all places over sanders claim that disney underpays staff even outside of disney iger suffered a setback in february when the nfl relocated the rams to inglewood over a plan iger pushed to bring two teams to la and then theres igers biggest challenge of all replacing himself before his retirement in  a task he admits he has yet to fulfill after chosen heir tom staggs failed to impress the board none of these topics were offlimits when iger sat for a minute interview in his office suite which features a giant photo of daisy ridley in star wars and a wax statue of legendary nfl coach vince lombardi which iger found at an espn zone restaurant before you got this job you explained your vision to the board for many months will that vetting process go on now with your potential successor yes it has been a rigorous process the process is far from over obviously and the people being considered will be asked very much about who they are and what they are made of what makes them tick what their passions are what their curiosities are what they bring to the table in terms of their ability to run a company as large as complex as important as valuable as this the question you hate if you cant find someone would you stay on laughs i said repeatedly i have no intention of staying on but that phrasing leaves it open thats what everybody else says im leaving in  tom staggs is said to have failed to impress the board with his vision for what he would do with the company i think thats a little too specific it wasnt about vision i dont want to go back over old territory but tom spent a year as coo and the succession process took place during that period of time so it gave the board and myself included a chance to fully assess who tom was even though he worked for the company for a long time what he represented what he could do how he fit in how he might live up to the criteria that the board and others would expect of the ceo of the walt disney co and what was ultimately concluded is something i dont really need to discuss but that very much was part of a succession process does that make sense yes without characterizing what he lacked what he had etc pixar marvel and lucasfilm are run by individuals who operate outside the traditional hollywood system and report to alan horn john lasseter and ed catmull do their thing in the bay area mostly kevin feige at marvel operates as an island and kathleen kennedy is running lucasfilm from london and san francisco and here i would turn that around the essence of what they do is they are extreme insiders at how they manage how they care for where their passions lie for their own storytelling their own brands and the meaning of star wars and lucasfilm marvel pixar disney animation no one knows and has more passion about those stories and storytelling and those brands than they do and that contributes greatly to their successes what ive really tried to do is to not disrupt that catmulls book is very much about how he and john maintain the separate cultures of pixar and disney animation while imparting to disney animation the essence of what was working at pixar thats very tough i spent a full day at pixar thanks to steve jobs and john lasseter and ed catmull when i had broached to steve the idea of buying pixar we began a conversation and i said i need to spend a day there i need to go into the tent for a day and he said absolutely i went completely alone i didnt have a piece of paper and a pen i had nothing to take notes on i met every director they each pitched me seven or eight films i met everyone and my takeaway was that there was a culture there that was extraordinary and that the worst thing that we could do as a company would be to destroy or damage it in any way when we valued pixar everybody said we spent too much for those assets but a large chunk of what we were valuing was what would happen if we could actually infuse in disney animation a culture that wouldnt be exactly like pixar but borrowed elements from it and ultimately turn the fortunes of disney animation around here we are in  we look at zootopia which grossed a billion dollars coming off of big hero  and frozen and tangled and wreckit ralph its all rooted in the knowledge that ed and john the socalled outsiders to disney but insiders to pixar brought to the table usually its the opposite you buy a company and basically destroy the company should star wars fans be worried about rogue one doing reshoots ive seen rogue one ive seen not only an edited picture but ive seen significantly more footage than was even in that picture thats actually going to be a fine film you have another lucasfilm property indiana jones and steven spielberg has agreed to make a fifth film will there be an indiana jones universe eventually like star wars not like star wars no but we hope … right now were focused on a reboot or a continuum and then a reboot of some sort from left han zheng communist party secretary of shanghai wang yang china’s vice premier and iger during the opening ceremony of the shanghai disney park on june  reboot youve got harrison ford for this movie and then the presumption is there will be a younger … well well bring him back then we have to figure out what comes next thats what i mean its not really a reboot its a boot — a reboot i dont know thr has been using the term requel for these sequels that reboot the franchise requel laughs we got harrison ford as indiana jones in the film but then whats the direction ive had discussions about what the direction is but i dont want to get into it but you do see making more films yes i do i dont think it reaches the scale of the universe of star wars but i see making more it wont be just a oneoff why do you think the wanda guys have shown such public animosity toward disney one wanda guy the one wanda guy who matters i have no idea i was as perplexed by that as anybody else he owns amc theatres last i checked were a pretty significant part of that business given the movies we make and they distribute weve done nothing in terms of shanghai disneyland to in any way antagonize or intimidate any potential competitors china is a big enough land from a people perspective and geography to house far more than one theme park company from left thendisney ceo michael eisner makeawish foundation ceo david williams and thendisney ceoelect iger in july  have any of your executives been to the wanda park that is open weve sent people to that but i dont want to comment on what theyve seen i dont even want to comment on wanda parks except that were not in the same business as theyre in speaking of people who have said things about disney lets talk about the bernie sanders thing that was pleasant it was a little unusual to see you respond like that on facebook bernie sanders bernie sanders i thought about what he said i thought about how misleading it was how factless it was how onesided and unfair it was i decided it was irresponsible and then i said he doesnt just have a right to tee off on us without someone responding and who best to respond in terms of making a point and getting attention than me and thats what i did and by the way if he does it again ill do it again this interview will come out after the california primary so he may be less of a factor he criticizes us about wages for instance were one of the first companies to commit to taking our minimum wage up to  which we did without anybody putting a gun to our head we did it it was the right thing to do we said a few years ago we were going to hire veterans and weve hired thousands of veterans weve made huge investments in us infrastructure what we did at california adventure in anaheim a few years ago that was more than  billion of investment and thousands of jobs on the ground in california and the other thing that he pointed to which i do not want to get into much detail about but this whole notion of using people under the hb visa plan that has been completely misconstrued how so we had a technology group in orlando that was essentially trained in legacy technology that we were moving away from we decided that we had to upgrade technology and the best way to do it was to use a company from the outside to provide that help that affected  jobs so we went to  people and said were basically eliminating your jobs because we need this higher more modern technology we found jobs in our company for  of those people thats nowhere to be found in the stories so  of them were affected which i dont take lightly although in this changeover to new technology we created another  jobs for other people so the net result was actually more jobs rather than fewer the mistake that was made is that we asked people who were leaving to help train their successors thats common in the business but it doesnt necessarily mean that its right and looking back im sorry that we did that because theres something insulting about that that got a huge amount of attention and rubbed people the wrong way and i completely understand why it would it just does not pass a smell test even if it is common practice some people say your postdisney life will be in politics yeah ive heard that a lot of people — a lot — have urged me to seek political office all kinds of different jobs everybody has got a different idea for me except all roads lead through my wife laughs but you wouldnt rule out a run for say governor of california i will not be specific about any office i wouldnt rule in or rule out … honestly im interested in politics im interested in giving back in some form performing some sort of civic duty but im not exploring a run for governor or senator or anything along those lines im focused on running disney does that answer the question sure what did you learn from your experience with the nfl and trying to bring the teams to la oh god im  years old and still learning things the only thing i really learned was that i misread the chances going in i actually thought the chances that we had — myself and the partnership with the raiders and the chargers — i thought the chances were better in the end than what i discovered they were there was a very very strong leaning going into that process to bring the rams here and i misread how strong that was thats all i wish by the way the rams do great that they build a great stadium will you be a seasonticket holder im a lifetime green bay packers fan i doubt im going to be a seasonticket holder in la im going to keep my allegiance to the packers and now youve got aaron rodgers brother on the bachelorette laughs yes some speculated nfl owners wanted to send a message that the nfl is bigger than disney do you agree with that sentiment i have no idea thats the first ive heard of that would you ever be involved in owning another sports team probably not everyone asks what is the fix for espn youve said an improved digital offering is coming can you give a timeline for the espn digital rollout and whats going on there well first of all when people say fix that usually suggests something is really broken and its not espn is not broken at all espn like a lot of other media entities is facing challenges that they havent faced before that are due to some very obvious circumstances which is technologys effect on media both on the creative side the distribution side and the consumption side theres more competition the power shift from the distributor and the creator to the consumer is pretty apparent and its critical to be as present as possible on all platforms which espn is — but also to monetize them in as effective a way as possible so what espn is exploring theyre creating more product that can be sold directly to the consumer while at the same time doing what they can to make the product they sell to the distributors as vital as possible in terms of timeline i can only tell you theres a significant amount of work going on as we speak to move more espn product onto new platforms as fast as possible so there will be a standalone livesports espn equivalent of hbo now or cbs all access im not going to say that is it inevitable that espn will have a more direct consumer product in the marketplace yes what that product is to what extent it mirrors the product they have now and to what extent it is … ill call it an offshoot i cant get into those details i dont think its safe to assume espn is going to take the product it has now and immediately take it over the top like hbo did to sell directly to consumers its even more complicated because many believe espn is propping up traditional distributor businesses as people subscribe to their bundle to get live sports espn plays a vital role in the health of the multichannel bundle yes that goes back to the old question of to what extent are you a disruptor to what extent do you allow yourself to get disrupted thats a debate we have all the time abc finished in fourth place this season and some of the news properties are softening in ratings how do you think ben sherwood is doing running the disneyabc tv group ben sherwood is doing great ben sherwood is a great competitor meaning he loves to compete and he also is realistic about the challenges that his businesses face and he has a keen understanding that business as usual is not a successful strategy in a world that has become so unusual kelly ripa felt blindsided by michael strahans move to good morning america do you think that situation could have been handled differently laughs heres what im not going to do here im not going to extend that narrative with apple ceo jobs in september  people said it was bens first public challenge in that role hes had many other challenges hulu which disney coowns is going to offer live tv channels which seems to be a rival to the traditional cable bundle how do you reconcile those i dont mind that i like aiding and abetting more opportunity for content owners channel owners and i like the idea of it entering the marketplace as an alternative to other forms of distribution because there are many alternatives cropping up its an interesting situation for comcast which backs hulu and has its massive cable business and now hulu is in the distribution business right when comcast bought nbcuniversal whats the difference make my day comcast laughs come after us because were going into the distribution business didnt you go into the content business and the theme park business really and comcast is investing heavily in theme parks and coming after you in animation with the purchase of dreamworks animation i saw someones comment from the investor community my goodness theyre biting the hand that feeds them or what signal does this send to their distributors well what signal does this send to the content owners when the distributors go into the content business i havent lost sleep over that but it happens i havent heard it described that way but thats what it is its the exact same thing if anything you could argue that its less so because hulu is an upstart whereas they bought nbcuniversal they bought cable channels they bought theme parks they bought a movie studio they went into direct competition with us in broadcast tv in local tv in cable tv in the theme park business and in movies thats a lot by the way im not complaining about it but its hard to believe that us taking hulu into the direction of becoming a multichannel distributor is something that anybody should be worried about in terms of the message that it sends do you think there will be a correction in the value of sportsrights deals there isnt one in sight even if espn stops pumping up prices well espn was pumping them up and fox and comcast and time warner too i last saw twitter bought some nfl rights yahoo is bidding on rights who knows what verizon will do i dont see one in sight maybe in five years seven years when im governor of california laughs when youre the governor do you see the same number of hollywood studios will there be consolidation will a tech company buy something i dont think i would describe them as studios not that there arent studios today i think theres a general belief — general among not just the industry were in but an expanded set of the industry that includes tech companies and various new entrants into media — theres a general belief that content is king you will see more investment in that and that will mean more entrants into it i wouldnt conclude that they would become studios per se but makers of content as youve already seen in tv and movies with netflix and amazon i saw jeff bezos not long ago and he was describing what he was doing hes making movies amazon had a great party at cannes is amazon a studio what is it netflix studio do you think wanda or another chinese company would take a stake in paramount if it becomes available now youre back to wanda i dont know what wanda is up to i do not know speaking of paramount are you close at all with sumner redstone no i had dinner with sumner twice that someone arranged but i have no relationship with sumner how will that viacom saga play out your guess is as good as mine you know what were fortunate as a company that we dont have any of that kind of complexity which of the other media moguls are you close to ive been in the business for  years and ive been in this job for almost  so yes i know philippe dauman and sumner and brad grey jeff bewkes kevin tsujihara a little bit ron meyer jeff shell steve burke brian roberts michael lynton jim gianopulos rupert murdoch iger and bay with sons robert “maxwell” iger right and william at the  nba allstar game at staples center do you know the sons i know lachlan and james not well but yeah the sense is the entertainment industry has taken a backseat in terms of prestige and attention to silicon valley do you agree theyre the ones that are trying to get into our business where does that put entertainment in terms of the pecking order i wont speak for the entertainment industry i speak for disney ive seen people in the industry come to work every morning paranoid about what the other person or other company is doing that means youre spending time and focus on somebody elses business instead of your own what is success to you for the shanghai park well the first thing is just making sure people thoroughly enjoy the experience and that it is operationally smooth meaning everything is working crowds are being maintained effectively the food is good i read about the dollar dumplings speaking of dumplings about  percent of the food is chinese and a lot of it is shanghai food although we actually have a restaurant that has seven different areas in it that represent seven different areas of china and their food one thing i find amusing about the park is there is no main street usa that was my doing im pretty well steeped in park lore and i certainly knew that main street was based on walts drive from his hometown i like main street a lot but i did not think it would resonate with the people of china in any way daughters kathleen right and amanda with bay and iger do you have jack sparrow from pirates of the caribbean in the park yes and johnny depps personal problems not worried about it the scandal will pass i dont know whether it passes or not we have jack sparrow you think people separate right hows your relationship with marvel ceo ike perlmutter these days my relationship with ike is good but you allowed marvels kevin feige to move from under ike to under film chief alan horn that didnt rankle ike sure it did do you see ike being a major player at this company for a while what does a major player mean major stockholder influencer i have no idea what he does with his stock hes made a lot of money on the marvel transaction and hes made a lot of money on disney stock since he took it as part of the transaction and bought more since then and he gets a big dividend im actually not in his head in that regard so i dont know and he doesnt in any way discuss it with me he likes to call me at seven in the morning sometimes ill say ike ive just pushed the button on the coffee maker and i havent had my first cup yet so i need  minutes who do you lean on when making decisions who are your confidants i have a great team i have communications chief zenia mucha a great general counsel alan braverman chief strategy officer kevin mayeri have a very strong and relatively new cfo christine mccarthy and i have a great head of hr jayne parker thats the core corporate team and then the business unit team alan horn is right down the hall and ben sherwood who is relatively new this is a team i work very closely with for instance we have lunch every monday we had lunch today for an hour and a half and the first thing i did was show them a sevenminute video of shanghai … just to get everybody in a good mood then we did a business update we talked about wanda we talked about some of espns issues we congratulated ourselves that we have the warriors and the cavaliers in the nba finals its a mutually supportive environment theres always politics in any company but its a fairly

executive and chairman until july  an extension of one year beyond his previously pushed back retirement date reflecting a continuing streak of success at the world’s largest entertainment company but also the lack of a clear successor“succession is a complicated thing and the board and i felt that we could use more time to not only spend on succession but to create a better transition” mr iger said during a midmorning appearance at a previously scheduled university of southern california event he was interviewed on stage by his wife willow bay the newly named dean of usc’s annenberg school for communication and journalismmr iger said that wielding longterm corporate power can be corrosive“when your convictions prove to be right more than wrong you get really confident” he said “you easily get more dismissive of other people’s ideas and other people’s convictions so i want to be really careful that i leave at a time when i’m not only feeling like i’m at the top of my game but when it’s absolutely right for the company” as for his multiple renewals he added “i’m serious about it this time” advertisement continue reading the main story under the contract extension mr iger’s

announcing a new retirement deadline tells me that perhaps succession planning is further along than we thought”even among media conglomerates disney has a unique mix of businesses some of which are healthier than others the company’s movie studio is widely regarded as the strongest in hollywood — “beauty and the beast” released last week has already taken in more than  million worldwide — and the disney theme parks are delivering record profits but the company’s vast consumer products division has been in decline and disney’s television operation which includes abc disney channel and

a stormtrooper” he said — and watching early footage from films on his laptop ms bay noted that their last family christmas card had a photo of mr iger riding a roller coaster at shanghai disneylandas

escholarship disney ceo robert iger announces ironclad policy of no smoking in youthrated disney movies submitted by sglantz on fri   yesterday march   dr gina intinarelli a cardiothoracic nurse from ucsf and i attended the walt disney corp  annual meeting   during the question and answer period gina told disney ceo and chairman of the board robert iger of the thousands of patients with heart disease and cancer she had care for that virtually all of these people started smoking as kids and that the us surgeon general had concluded that exposure to smoking onscreen caused kids to start smoking  she pointed out that nearly half of the marvel movies disney owns marvel had contained smoking  she then asked mr iger for if disney would implement an “ironclad” policy of keeping smoking   iger responded definitively  here is how it was reported in the guardian   walt disney chairman and ceo bob iger said he would “absolutely prohibit” smoking in all disney films going forward including those produced by the studio’s wholly owned comicbookmovie division marvel studios and star wars unit lucasfilm   “i thought it was the right thing for us to do” said iger who was responding to a query from an investor “we are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board marvel lucas pixar and disney films” he said “except when we are depicting a historical figure who may have smoked at the time for instance we’ve been doing a movie on abraham lincoln he was a smoker and we would consider that acceptable   “but in terms of any new characters that are created for any of those films under any of those labels we will absolutely prohibit smoking in any of those films”   i was the next person to question mr iger  i thanked him but pointed out that the policy on disney’s website which dates from  contained loopholes for “creative necessity” and that many disney films in recent years but not last year included smoking  he said that this decision had been made in the last  hours and that the policy on disney’s website would be updated accordingly   if the actual policy is written as unequivocally as iger’s statement yesterday this is a huge step forward and a major contribution to preventing millions of deaths worldwide   i then went on and told mr iger that the cdc has reported that an r rating for smoking would save a million us kids lives and asked him if disney would follow up its policy by using its position as one of the  companies that comprise the board of and control the motion picture association of america mpaa if it would public urge other media companies to follow its lead and support an r rating for smoking    he responded that he would not tell other companies what to do and that disney  has no control over the rating of individual films and that the rating system was independently managed     i responded that i was not talking about disney controlling ratings of individual films but rather changing the mpaa’s rules that it uses to rate individual films on the grounds that the mpaa board makes mpaa policy   he responded that we should be talking to the mpaa  it told him that there had been several meetings  by health groups with the mpaa and that the mpaa told them to work with the studios   it pointed out that we had a situation in which the mpaa was telling us to talk to the studios and the studios were point to the mpaa leaving no one to solve the problem but that the mpaa board which consists of the  major studios had the authority to solve the problem   mr iger also questioned disney’s lawyer who sits on the mpaa board as well as alan horn head of walt disney studios about these arrangements    here is how hollywood reporter reported the exchange   iger was called on to reiterate his pledge of not showing characters smoking on tv or in movies except where necessary for historical accuracy though one shareholder asked him to go further by asking the mpaa to give an rrating to movies that include smoking and to rally other studios to support such a measure  iger said it would be a little presumptuous to tell other studios what to do or to tell the mpaa how it should rate movies the shareholder noted that he had spoken to the mpaa about his idea and the mpaa told him to speak to the studios so he was now getting the runaround i think the mpaa is kind of talking out of both sides of its mouth and the result is a million kids are going to die unnecessarily said the shareholder   while we did not win a commitment to push the mpaa i do think that this exchange did inform both mr iger as well as disney’s senior management and full board about the mpaa’s behavior and the fact that the mpaa was pushing us on to the studios   perhaps this exchange will lead to some changes in the future   overall a good day   i also want to thank as you sow and the interfaith center for corporate responsibility for working with us over the years to press all the studios on the smoking issue  their work including pursuing several shareholder resolutions made an important contribution to this step  they also obtained proxies from  sisters of st francis of philadelphia and trinity health so gina and i could attend the meeting   here is some of the press coverage   the guardian the wrap variety hollywood reporter msncom       sglantzs blog add new comment comments submitted by sglantz on sun   gina and stan with mickey at the disney annual meeting reply submitted by sglantz on fri   here is the transcript of the discussion at the disney meeting its worth carefully reading what disney ceo bob iger and their general counsel said about smoking in movies and the mpaa at their annual meeting   the walt disney company annual meeting san francisco march   official audio recording available at httpedgemediaservercommpuvuzkf   time  min  sec gina intinarelli my name is gina intinarellishuler i’m a shareholder i live in san francisco i’m also a critical care nurse i’ve been a nurse for  years and i have taken care of thousands of patients who have died of tobaccorelated diseases  we know that the surgeon general produced a report in  that showed conclusively that if children are exposed to smoking images in movies it will cause them to begin smoking  any of us who have known smokers or have known people that have died from smoking know that they started when they were young  disney has a policy to discourage smoking in youth rated films but between  and  about  of all smoking images shown to children were from disney studios  however in  and so far this year there have been no smoking images in any disney films applause  this shows a commitment to real corporate responsibility to children’s future health  however for disney’s marvel studios you may not know  of their youth rated movies show smoking so mr iger i ask if you will be willing to change the world and commit to an ironclad policy that your pg and youth rated films never show smoking in them   robert iger well the answer to that is “yes” i will commit to that we are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board marvel lucas pixar disney films except when we are depicting an historical figure who may have smoked at the time of his life so for instance if we were doing a movie on abraham lincoln he was a smoker then we would consider that acceptable but in terms of any new characters that are created under any of those labels we would absolutely prohibit smoking in any of those films   intervening question   time  min  sec stanton glantz my name is stanton glantz i’m a professor of medicine at uc san francisco and have been working on the issue of smoking in the movies for a long time i’d first like to thank you for the unequivocal statement about getting smoking out of youth rated films that disney produces and distributes  i would point out that the policy that you have on your website isn’t as strong as what you just said and would hope that you would see that they are brought into sync  my question is  the cdc has estimated that an r rating for smoking in movies would save a million kids’ lives among kids alive today in the united states will disney take a public position in support of an industrywide standard of an r rating for smoking and use its seat on the mpaa to push for an industrywide level playing field policy that would essentially institutionalize the policy that you just outlined since we do  think an exception for actual historical figures who actually smoked is appropriate   iger first of all i will make sure that the policy that is described on our website reflects the policy that i just articulated  the policy that i articulated was amended within the last  hours actually it would be broader than the policy that we had because i thought it was the right thing for us to do   we are a member of the mpaa however we don’t get involved in how the mpaa applies ratings to films  they do that independent of us and occasionally we lobby with them on how they’ve rated some of our films but we certainly don’t get involved in how they rate the films of other studios nor do we really try to influence what the policies are of the other studios that we compete with  we just like to think that we have a responsibility to shareholders of the company and to customers around the world and we like to behave in a very very responsible way in that regard as evidenced by the policy that i outlined  so i doubt that you are going to get much support from us on lobbying the mpaa to put an r rating on films that have smoking   i think it would be a little bit presumptuous of me to commit to doing that today without getting a little bit more of a flavor or perspective on the dynamic that exists at the mpaa on the subject i’m just not well versed in that i don’t know what positions the other studios have even taken about this   glantz we have had meetings with the mpaa and they’ve told us to go to the studios because it’s the studios that sit on the mpaa board and make the policies  so the mpaa actually is why i’m asking you this question because the mpaa has told a wide range of health groups and representatives and groups like the american  academy of pediatrics that it is really up to the studios to make the policy and the mpaa is just implementing the policies that the six studios on the board establish  so it’s a little bit back and forth   iger i think there might be nuance there  it’s up to the studios to make policy regarding their own standards and the films that they create as i describe for disney  i don’t believe it’s up to the studios to set ratings policy for the mpaa  they determine how they apply ratings independent really of even the six board members that sit on the mpaa  i’ll inquire to see if i am accurate in that regard  alan  braverman disney general  counsel  …   glantz the board doesn’t rate individual movies but the rules for rating the policies that are implemented in the ratings the mpaa has told us are determined by the board of directors of the mpaa and then implemented by the mpaa   iger our general counsel alan braverman is here and he is one of our representatives on the mpaa board  alan you have a microphone …   alan braverman it’s a separate group than the mpaa board  it’s a separate group that administers the ratings in an independent fashion i think the best way to close out this conversation is to take the point to the group that administers the ratings because there is a dynamic that goes on within that group and the purpose of that rating organization was to set up an entity independent of the studios to apply a series of ratings to the studio productions so that studios were not engaged themselves in selfrating their own content   iger we will make sure that we communicate at least to the board of the mpaa that this came up at our shareholders meeting and you brought it up   glantz i’d appreciate an opportunity later for some more detailed discussions because i think the mpaa is talking out of both sides of its mouth and the result is that a million kids are going to die unnecessarily   iger it’s a serious issue i agree with you reply submitted by sglantz on mon   major health groups tell iger that mpaa says studios in charge after the exchange between professor stanton glantz and disney ceo bob iger in which mr iger said that the studios did not control mpaa ratings policy the four health groups that last met with the mpaa wrote iger confirming to him that the mpaa had said that the studios are the policymakers  the mpaa just implements the policy   disney along with the  other major studios make up the mpaa board of directors   here is their letter   march       robert iger chairman and ceo the walt disney company  s buena vista street burbank ca      dear mr iger   as public health organizations committed to reducing tobacco use we thank you for strengthening disney’s smokefree movies policy in america tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death resulting in  premature deaths a year    disney’s actions are an important step to help prevent millions of teens from beginning to smoke in  the united states surgeon general concluded that exposure to onscreen smoking causes young people to start smoking the centers for disease control and prevention subsequently concluded that an r rating for movies featuring smoking would be expected to reduce the number of teen smokers by nearly twenty percent preventing one million deaths from smoking among children alive today   while we are delighted by disney’s actions eliminating smoking in youth rated movies is a policy that should be adopted industrywide  in fact our organizations have repeatedly advocated that youth rated movies should be rated r unless the movie clearly and unambiguously reflects the dangers and consequences of smoking or if it accurately depicts the behavior of an actual historical figure  we have had discussions with the motion picture association of america mpaa but have been told repeatedly that it will not act without direction from the studios  since data indicate that individual movie company policies alone have not been shown to be efficient in minimizing smoking in movies we hope disney can take a leadership role within the mpaa to move it towards a rating system that prohibits smoking in youth rated movies   we appreciate disney’s leadership on this issue and we welcome collaboration to encourage other studios to eliminate onscreen smoking and tobacco use as a cause of youth smoking   sincerely   jonathan d klein md mph faap associate executive director and director julius b richmond center american academy of pediatrics   harold p wimmer national president and ceo american lung association   matthew l myers president campaign for tobacco free kids   robin koval president and ceo legacy reply submitted by anonymous on tue   stronger approach needed even better than a ratings change would be for bans on manufacturing selling and giving away tobacco products  that would follow th century precedent before the focus changed to weak antitobacco actions  states such as iowa httpmedicolegaltripodcomiowalawhtm  tennessee httpmedicolegaltripodcomtennlawhtm  and michigan httpmedicolegaltripodcommilawhtm outright banned cigarettes in this way state action occurred when congress refused to act against tobacco  it had been asked years before when in  womens christian temperance union wctu members during the   tenure of francis willard ms ma lld sent to congress thousands of petitions for banning cigarettes citing the already thenknown fact that cigarettes were causing insanity and death to thousands of people reply submitted by sglantz on sat   two points that need to be clarified with mr iger at the shareholders meeting mr iger said we are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board marvel lucas pixar disney films  this list does not include touchstone which is the disney brand that has released most of the disney movies with smoking   first we need to clarify whether this was just an inadvertent omission and that the policy will include all disney brands ie across the board or whether it just applies to the bands that iger listed  hopefully it will be the former   second we need to clarify that the policy applies to all films that disney distributes not just the films that it produces  this is a loophole that several other studios have hidden behind  again hopefully across the board includes these films too   these issues should be resolved in the formal published policy when disney makes it available     reply contact us center leadership log increate account

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
