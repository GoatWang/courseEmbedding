advisory council – google advisory council  advisory council skip to content the advisory council to google on the right to be forgotten read the advisory councils final report how should one person’s right to be forgotten be balanced with the public’s right to information a may  ruling by the court of justice of the european union found that european law gives people the right to ask search engines like google to remove results for queries that include their name since then we’ve received removal requests for all sorts of content serious criminal records embarrassing photos instances of online bullying and namecalling decadesold allegations negative press stories and more for each of these requests we’re required to weigh on a casebycase basis an individual’s right to be forgotten with the public’s right to information we want to strike this balance right this obligation has been a new and difficult challenge for us and we’ve sought advice on the principles google ought to apply when making decisions on individual cases that’s why we convened a council of experts to review input from dozens of experts in meetings across europe as well as from thousands of submissions

contrast to its chief competitors google was a private company and did not have to report its financial results and other significant business information to the public in filings with the commission google viewed the public disclosure of its detailed financial information as strategically disadvantageous as drummond recognized and the company was concerned that providing option recipients with the financial disclosures required by rule  could result in the disclosure of this information to the public at large and significantly to googles competitors  by january  google was again considering granting stock options to its employees drummond learned that the stock option grants being considered for approval by googles board might cause google to grant more than  million worth of options in a month period and therefore would require google to provide option recipients with financial disclosures under rule  drummond in consultation with outside counsel and personnel in googles legal department determined that other exemptions for certain of the stock option grants permitted google to issue the option grants without registering the securities or providing disclosures otherwise required by rule  for example rule  of regulation d of the securities act exempts from registration certain sales to accredited investors including investors meeting a particular level of net worth or annual income drummond also considered the potential applicability of section  of the securities act an exemption from registration for certain private securities offerings finally drummond determined that even if it were later determined that his analysis of the applicability of other registration exemptions was incorrect google could make an offer of rescission to the option holders  drummond concluded that a sufficient number of options had been issued to googles employees and executives who were accredited investors under rule  to avoid exceeding rule s  million threshold at least for the immediate future  drummond attended a january  meeting of googles board of directors and advised the board to approve a new stock option plan for employee and consultant option grants going forward drummond also advised that the board issue stock option grants pursuant to that new stock option plan which grants were to become effective when the plan became effective in february drummond did not report to the board that issuing the new option grants might cause google to exceed the  million disclosure threshold of rule  and that google would be relying on other exemptions from the registration requirements  at the january  meeting googles board approved the new stock option plan and the option grants pursuant to that plan and the additional options became effective on february   contrary to drummonds expectations the option grants resulted in google exceeding rule s  million disclosure threshold even excluding option grants arguably exempt from registration under rule  the dollar value of options granted by google over the prior month period exceeded  million google however failed to provide the financial disclosures and other information mandated by rule  absent compliance with rule  the options issued during this month period were not exempt from registration and googles securities issuance violated the registration provisions of section   between february and may  google continued to issue additional stock options to its employees by unanimous written consent googles board approved additional stock option grants on february   march   april   and may   as a result of these option grants the value of securities issued by google during a month period was approximately  million far in excess of the  million disclosure threshold of rule  yet google did not provide the legally required disclosures to the option recipients throughout this period google failed to monitor its stock option grant levels and failed to determine whether the company was in compliance with rule   in approximately june  drummond learned that google probably had exceeded the  million disclosure threshold of rule  drummond further believed that there were not likely to be enough stock option recipients who qualified as accredited investors to render the securities exempt from registration and thus the company could not avoid the disclosure obligations of rule  by relying on rule   drummond believed that googles stock option grants might be exempt under section  of the securities act an exemption available for certain private placements of securities  at a june  meeting googles board of directors adopted two new stock option plans allowing for the issuance of additional options beginning in july  drummond discussed the need for the stock option plans but he did not advise the board that googles option grants would exceed the  million disclosure threshold of rule  or of the risk that other exemptions from registration may not apply based in part on drummonds advice google issued additional options in the months following the board approval exceeding the  million disclosure threshold  googles option grants did not qualify for exemption under section  among other things google offered millions of dollars worth of stock options to all of its employees without considering the financial sophistication of each employee and did not provide its employees with the information found in a registration statement  for the twelve months ended december   google issued approximately  million worth of stock options pursuant to the stock option plans adopted in june  google issued an additional  million worth of options in the first four months of  prior to the companys filing of a registration statement for its initial public offering none of these option grants were accompanied by the disclosures required by rule   on august   google filed a form s  with the commission to register a rescission offer for the stock option grants and the purchase of shares upon the exercise of options made between september  and june  to googles employees and consultants the form s was declared effective on november   however the rescission offer does not cure a violation of section  d legal conclusion  section a of the securities act prohibits the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell a security unless a registration statement is in effect as to such security section c of the securities act prohibits the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy a security unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security  google offered to sell and sold its securities without a registration statement filed or in effect and without a valid exemption from registration as a result of the conduct described above google violated and drummond caused google to violate sections a and c of the securities act the commission previously has charged attorneys for causing section  violations see eg in the matter of john l milling esq securities act rel no  feb   e cooperation  in determining to accept google and drummonds offer of settlement the commission took into account their cooperation during the commission staffs investigation iv in view of the foregoing the commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions agreed to in respondents offer accordingly it is hereby ordered pursuant to section a of the securities act that respondents google and drummond cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of sections a and c of the securities act by the commission jonathan g katz secretary
