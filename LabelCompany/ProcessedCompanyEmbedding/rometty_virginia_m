and led a historic turnaround of ibm an endangered corporate icon mr palmisano inherited a company that had returned to health but he set about transforming it once again under mr palmisano ibm sold its personal computer and some other hardware lines and focused increasingly on services and software ibm sells mainly to business and governments leaving consumer technology to othershis strategy for driving the company behind big services projects to use technology to tackle big business and societal challenges like energy traffic and water management had a catchy title “smarter planet” but such grand themes were initially met with skepticism on wall street “the challenge is that you have to bring investors with you” mr palmisano explainedthat led to the development of a “financial roadmap” setting out fiveyear plans for its growth initiatives and profit targets for the company as a whole this year ibm is completing the first fiveyear roadmap with the numbers running ahead of the plan

this page continue reading the main story photo virginia m rometty newly named as chief of ibm has a husband with the time and flexibility to support her career credit graham carlow here’s to mark romettymr rometty is a principal investor in the bam oil company where he’s listed as treasurer and secretary and when i called answered the phone he’s also married to virginia rometty the new ceodesignate and first woman tapped to head ibm a company that not only ranks th in the fortune  but stands as a symbol of american managerial prowess acquaintances say the intensely private mr rometty deserves tremendous credit for pursuing a career that gave him the time and flexibility to support his wife’s ascension to the pinnacle of global business — as for that matter do the vast majority of ceo spouses of both genders still the ceo husband remains a rarity in american businesswhen i reached mr rometty this week at his florida office he was emphatic that this was a subject he didn’t want to discuss nor did ms rometty who was logging some of the millions of miles she travels every year visiting ibm customers all over the globean ibm spokesman said both were eager to preserve as much privacy as possible and who can blame them all he said was that both enjoyed scuba diving and broadway plays and that they divided their time between homes in new york and bonita springs fla they met when both were enrolled in the general motors institute embarking on business careers and have been married for  yearsthe romettys aren’t the only couple reluctant to discuss the husband’s role in his wife’s success there’s still a social stigma for the stayathome or less successful husband that women don’t face and management experts say that that has to change if women are going to be represented in the top jobs at a level commensurate with their numbers and talent advertisement continue reading the main story asked at a barnard college conference what men could do to help advance women’s leadership rosabeth moss kanter a professor at harvard business school and author of the landmark “men and women of the corporation” answered “the laundry” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “women are not going to say ‘my husband is not as successful as he could have been because he’s been supporting me’ ” ms kanter told me this week “it would be seen as putting him down but when the shoe is on the other foot men say ‘she really helped me’ people say ‘isn’t it wonderful that he has someone who allows him to focus on his work’ this is culturally valued”statistics suggest that aspirants to america’s top corporate jobs had better have a spouse partner or someone else willing to be devoted to the aspirant’s career “how do you compete without a spouse basically you can’t” richard zweigenhaft said mr zweigenhaft is professor of psychology at guilford college in north carolina and the coauthor with g william domhoff of “the new ceo’s” a study of women and minorities who are chief executives rowman  littlefield the overwhelming number of american ceo’s of both genders are married and most like ms rometty have been for many years divorce at this level is comparatively rare mr zweigenhaft and mr domhoff studied all  women who had held or currently hold the post of chief executive of a fortune  company ms rometty will be no  twentysix were married one was divorced and only one had never married “how many had house husbands we don’t really know but there are certainly some who fit that pattern” mr zweigenhaft said “many of the women ceo’s said they could not have succeeded without the support of their husbands helping with the children the household chores and showing a willingness to move”eighteen of the  women had children while impressive that’s a far lower rate than the  percent of married women in the population at large who have children of their own according to census datams rometty and her husband have no children ms kanter said she didn’t want to comment specifically about ms rometty whom she knows but said “whether to have kids is a major question couples have to face” she added “it’s been easier for male executives to feel great about having kids because in the traditional division of labor it’s the wives’ responsibility we haven’t moved that far towards the idea that men should do the same” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to

chief executive sam palmisano told the times that “ginni got it because she deserved it it’s got zero to do with progressive social policies” he didn’t say anything about mr rometty but ms rometty credits her husband with a crucial insight that helped shape her corporate ambitions“early in my career i can remember being offered a big job” she told a fortune magazine conference on women and careers last month “i right away said ‘you know what i’m not ready for this job i need more time i need more experience and then i could really do it well’ and so i said to him ‘i need to go home and think about it’ — and my husband at the time as usual i’m blahblahblahing and he’s just sitting there and as i’m telling him about this and i told him i would get back to them tomorrow and he said to me he looked at me and he just looked at me and he said ‘do you think a man would have ever answered that question that way’ and i sort of sat there — and it taught me a lesson and he said “i know you you go do it you’re going to — six months you’re going to be bored’ ”weren’t things supposed to be different wasn’t the rise of women in the workplace going to usher in a new era where two career couples would flourish side by side sharing household and family duties and a more balanced life “people used to say that men needed a wife at home and a wife at the office — the traditional secretary” ms kanter said “now women need the same thing an assistant at work and a stayathome husband or at least a husband who’s very flexible and supportive anyone who hopes to be a corporate chief executive needs a big support system” advertisement continue reading the main story there are prominent exceptions and there are male ceo’s who have wives with their own successful careers meg whitman newly installed as ceo at hewlettpackard is married to griffith harsh iv a widely published and highly regarded neurosurgeon on the faculty at stanford medical school who has pursued an obviously demanding and successful career the couple raised two sons still dr harsh left the harvard faculty and a prominent position at massachusetts general hospital to relocate to california when ms whitman was named chief executive of ebay earlier in her careersome of the women executives mr zweigenhaft studied “are married to highpowered partners who are also ceo’s or senior executives” he said such as laura sen chief executive of bj’s wholesale club who was married to c michael egan chief of the biotech company transmolecular until his death in there are very few true house husbands men with no career outside the home nearly all husbands of chief executives have had some occupation even if it is modest compared to their wives some husbands retire early frank fiorina who worked for many years at att took early retirement in  to better support the career of his wife carly fiorina who became chief executive of hewlettpackard the next year and subsequently ran for the united states senate ms fiorina had no children but helped raise his two children from a previous marriage and some ceo’s find additional support from other family members ms rometty is described as especially close to her mother whom she brought to this year’s ibm centennial celebrationamong male chief executives the supportive spouse still seems the normbut there are some signs of change steve tappin author of “the secrets of ceo’s” nb publishing  and a management consultant with executive clients said that top executives with highpowered spouses — or even no spouses — can now build “a great support system as long as they’re not financially constrained they need life assistants and deep levels of support from friends and confidantes it can even save them time not having to sustain a relationship”but one thing that hasn’t changed is the allout commitment to work and career needed from men and women who want to reach the top “this is why so many women bail out” mr zweigenhaft said “it’s not a life they want but some do and they’re finding the partners they need men who are comfortable with the role of the supportive spouse”ms kanter said “we’re at an odd inflection point we’re still trying to figure out what it means for men and women to be peers or to shift roles from time to time should one career come first couples are still struggling to work that out” continue reading the main story we’re
