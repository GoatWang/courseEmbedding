                                                                                                                             wl dr john d musil ceofounderavella of deer valley inc w whispering wind dr nd floorphoenix az  dear dr musil from february   to february   us food and drug administration fda investigators conducted an inspection of your facility avella of deer valley inc  n th drive suite  phoenix az  during the inspection the investigators noted that you were not receiving valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients for a significant number of the drug products you were producing in addition the investigators observed serious deficiencies in your practices for producing sterile drug products which put patients at risk for example during the inspection we observed your technicians performing aseptic operations while wearing nonsterile gowns and with skin exposed  these observations and others were noted on a form fda  issued on february   we acknowledge receipt of your firm’s response to the fda form  dated march   based on this inspection it appears that you are producing drugs that violate the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca a compounded drugs under the fdca at the time the fda inspected your facility there were conflicting judicial decisions regarding the applicability of section a of the fdca  usc § a which exempts compounded drugs from several key statutory requirements if certain conditions are met because your firm was in the ninth circuit at the time of our inspection fda applied the enforcement policy articulated in compliance policy guide  “pharmacy compounding” issued by fda on may   see notice of availability  fed reg   june   to your compounding of human drugs the cpg identified a nonexhaustive list of factors for the fda to consider in deciding whether to initiate an enforcement action with respect to the compounding of human drugs receipt of valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients prior to distribution of compounded drugs was relevant for both section a of the fdca and the pharmacy compounding cpg since the fda inspected your facility congress enacted and the president signed into law the compounding quality act cqa which amended fdca section a by eliminating the advertising restrictions that had been the basis for conflicting judicial decisions  the cqa otherwise left section a intact and so clarified that the remainder of section a including the requirement of valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients is applicable in every federal judicial circuit accordingly the drugs you compound without valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients are not entitled to the exemptions in section a during the fda inspection investigators observed that your firm did not receive valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients for a portion of the drug products you produce based on this factor alone those drugs were not entitled to the statutory exemptions for compounded drugs described in section a of the fdca and did not qualify for the agency’s exercise of enforcement discretion set forth in the cpg in addition we remind you that there are a number of other conditions that must be satisfied to qualify for the exemptions in section a of the fdca b  violations of the fdca because the drug products that you manufacture and distribute without valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients are not the subject of approved applications they are unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs in violation of sections a and f  usc §§ a and f of the fdca respectively in addition your sterile drug products are prepared packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated with filth or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health as such all sterile products you manufacture are adulterated within the meaning of section aa  usc § aa of the fdca furthermore because you manufacture and distribute drugs without valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients the manufacture of those drugs is also subject to fda’s current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations for finished pharmaceuticals title  code of federal regulations cfr parts  and  fda investigators observed significant cgmp violations at your facility causing such drug products to be adulterated within the meaning of section ab of the fdca  usc § ab  unapproved new drug products  you do not have any fdaapproved applications on file for the drug products for which you have not obtained valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients under sections d and a of the fdca  usc §§ d and a a new drug may not be introduced into or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless an application approved by fda under section  of the fdca  usc §  is in effect for the drug  your marketing of these products or other applicable products without an approved application violates these provisions of the fdca misbranded drug products  additionally because the drug products for which you have not obtained valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients are intended for conditions that are not amenable to selfdiagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners adequate directions cannot be written for them so that a layman can use these products safely for their intended uses consequently their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses causing them to be misbranded under section f of the fdca  usc § f and they are not exempt from the requirements of section f of the fdca see eg  cfr §  the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products therefore violates sections a of the fdca  usc § a it is also a prohibited act under section k of the fdca  usc § k to do any act with respect to a drug if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce of the components used to make the drug and results in the drug being misbranded  adulteration charges additionally fda investigators noted that your sterile drug products were prepared packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health causing your drug products to be adulterated under section aa of the fdca  usc  aa examples of those conditions include that technicians were performing aseptic operations while wearing non sterile gowns and with exposed skin in the face and neck area  fda investigators also noted cgmp violations at your facility causing the drug products for which you have not obtained valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients to be adulterated under section ab of the fdca  usc § ab  the violations include for example     your firm failed to establish or follow appropriate written procedures that are designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile and that include validation of all aseptic and sterilization processes  cfr b     your firm failed to ensure that manufacturing personnel wear clothing appropriate to protect drug product from contamination  cfr a     your firm failed to establish an adequate system for monitoring environmental conditions in aseptic processing areas  cfr civ c  corrective actions in your response to the form fda  dated march   you referenced your purported compliance with united states pharmacopeia uspnational formulary nf general chapter  “pharmaceutical compounding  sterile preparations” as noted above your firm has manufactured and distributed drugs without valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients and the manufacture of such drugs is subject to fda’s drug cgmp regulations  cfr parts  and  your firm’s planned corrections do not meet the minimum requirements of  cfr part  and there is no assurance that the drug products produced by your firm without valid prescriptions for individuallyidentified patients conform to these basic quality standards that ensure safety identity strength quality and purity  fda strongly recommends that your management immediately undertake a comprehensive assessment of your manufacturing operations including facility design procedures personnel processes materials and systems in particular this review should assess your aseptic processing operations a third party consultant with relevant sterile drug manufacturing expertise could be useful in conducting this comprehensive evaluation d  conclusion  the violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an allinclusive statement of violations at your facility you are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations it is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and fda regulations you

  cc harland hal wand executive directorarizona state board of pharmacy west adamsste phoenix az  compare western states med ctr v shalala  fd  th cir  with medical ctr pharm v mukasey  fd  th cir   see  usc § aa granting compounded drugs statutory exemptions if among other things “the drug product is compounded for an identified individual patient based on the    receipt of a valid prescription order or a notation approved by the prescribing practitioner on the prescription order that a compounded product is necessary for the identified patient    ” cpg at  “fda recognizes that pharmacists traditionally have extemporaneously compounded and manipulated reasonable quantities of human drugs upon receipt of a valid prescription for an individuallyidentified patient from a licensed practitioner this traditional activity is not the subject of this guidance” hr   public law  drug quality and security act nov    stat   pagesthe cqa contains a number of other provisions including new exemptions and requirements for compounders seeking to operate as outsourcing facilities a discussion of the cqa and the agency’s plans to implement the new law may be found at httpwwwfdagovdrugsguidancecomplianceregulatoryinformationpharmacycompoundingdefaulthtm  for example section a also addresses anticipatory compounding which includes compounding not distribution before receipt of a valid prescription order for an individual patient we are not addressing anticipatory compounding here the specific products made by your firm are drugs within the meaning of section g of the act  usc § g because they are intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of diseases further they are “new drugs” within the meaning of section p of the fdca  usc §
