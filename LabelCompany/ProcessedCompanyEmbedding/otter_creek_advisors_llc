thinkers who focus on creating an original and opportunistic portfolio driven by our own fundamental analysis put simply we do not rely heavily on wall street generated investment research we have found that our location in south florida away from major financial centers has been instrumental in avoiding the typical group think and herd mentality focus we believe in managing a relatively concentrated portfolio that is focused on our best ideas comprehensive fundamental analysis is what gives us conviction in managing a more concentrated portfolio relative to the majority of our peers investing with you we have a vested interest in the funds success investing a significant component of our personal savings creates the proper alignment between fund management and investor interests team approach team collaboration is fundamental to our firm we believe that it is important to have the entire team discuss investments collectively to reach a consensus opinion rather than being

to defenserelated federal agencies    needham  company llc analysts commented we are actually incrementally more positive on cree after termination of the wolfspeed divestiture to infineon not rated due to regulatory concerns while managements strategy is to transform cree from a device manufacturer to becoming a lighting company we have been concerned about the unintended consequence of the deal since selling wolfspeed would offload a large profit contributor we believe cree could be hastened to quickly redeploy that capital in acquisitions ultimately leading to buying a wrong asset we like the decision to keep wolfspeed especially as it appears the business is entering a new growth phase and contributing solid profits to the overall company with the model in flux and the loss of a cash for downside support for the stock we maintain our hold   ubs ag analysts commented crees had in line results excluding the  eps benefit from its legal settlement with feit we keep a sell rating as it is at the high end of its historical range at x its fye eps of  despite sales trends just starting to stabilize we believe the stock could trade higher in the near term as its main peer acuity brands

this to more positively impact sales in late fy and into fy given the  month conversion cycle   canaccord genuity analysts commented crees pivot towards being an led lighting pureplay will take time as the core commercial lighting business stays more muted and recent encouraging signs in led component pricing and potential micro led capacity absorption in the industry are too early to suggest a
