panhandlewere populated by a mix of former british colonials spanish royalists and american frontier settlers britain had ceded the territory to spain but in the napoleonic era spains increasing mismanagement of the region impelled a band of american settlers led by boatman and storekeeper reuben kemper and his brothers to institute a vigilante force revolt against spain and draft their own constitution peopled throughout with such lively and enterprising figures this book by the author of the pirates laffite is a colorful history of a forgotten rebellion by the time president madison sent troops to occupy the territory after the louisiana purchase the independent republic of west florida had already been in existence for  daysa significant study of an obscure but highly revealing moment in american history not only does william davis cast a bright light into these murky corners of our national past he does so with a grace and clarity equal to the best historical writing

hardcover product dimensions  x  x  inches isbn  pagespublication date  daedalus item code  this item is not available description winner of the american civil war museums jefferson davis prize and a main selection of the history book club ulysses s grant and robert e lee met in person only four times yet as the commanders of their respective armies they determined the outcome of americas most divisive war and cast largerthanlife shadows over their reunited nation william davisan advisor to the abraham lincoln bicentennial commission and a senior consultant for the history channels civil war journalwon an unprecedented fourth jefferson davis prize for this remarkable double biography of grant and lee they were from vastly different backgroundslee the melancholy realist came from a distinguished family of waning fortunes while grant the incurable optimist was a young man on the make in a new americayet they became almost indistinguishable in their battlefield instincts attitudes and skills in commanddual biographies are famously difficult to pull off but william c davis has done it with panache his research in previously unexploited sources reveals new information and insights on both grant and lee with narrative skill that shifts the focus back and forth between the two generals davis builds the tension as their careers converge toward the climax at appomattox here we have something genuinely new in civil war scholarshipjames m mcphersonthere are many volumes contrasting lee and grant but william c davis has gone far beyond the typical wartime comparisons this beautifully written and wonderfully entertaining study falls right into line with his other excellent works and the sidebyside comparisons of the lives and growth of lee and grant offer far more than the usual examination of civil war strategy this is a surprisingly fresh addition to any civil war libraryjeff shaara   you might also like the rogue republic how wouldbe patriots waged the
