influential italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes badia di morrona chianti i sodi del paretaio is a perennial gambero favorite having earned multiple “due bicchieri” “two glasses” honors in addition to praise as a “sincere wonderfully drinkable wine” the wine access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent  vintage by the case the land of badia di morrona in the picturesque hills between florence and pisa was first worked by th century benedictine monks today it is owned by count gaslini alberti who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past  years outfitting winemaker corrado dal piaz with a refurbished facility enlarged cellars and new casks and barrels dal piaz is notoriously hard on the badia’s  acres of grapes which soak up the sun on south and southeastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone he tightened spacing in the vines orchestrating a darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skintojuice ratio the result is sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity ’s long growing season allowed temperamental sangiovese to reach rare almost perfectly uniform maturity the vines stretched deep underground sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil putting out a dark crushedredfruit sangiovese infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins if you’re looking for vibrancy in your topclass chianti you’ll be hardpressed to find
