objective or will work under all market conditions the value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual companys financial condition and overall market conditions investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations potential differences in accounting and taxation policies as well as possible political economic and market risks these risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates in a declining interest rate environment a portfolio may generate less income in a rising interestrate environment bond prices fall investments in high yield securities commonly referred to as junk bonds are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities the prices of high yield securities which may be less liquid than higher rated securities may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market economic or political conditions real estate investments are subject to many of the risks associated with direct real estate ownership such as changes in economic conditions credit risk property taxes zoning laws and interest rate fluctuations derivatives can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on performance nondiversification occurs when portfolio assets are invested in fewer securities industries currencies or countries than in diversified investment portfolios nondiversification increases risk because each investment has a greater effect on portfolio performance and can also be affected by single economic political or regulatory occurrences geographic concentration occurs when a portfolio concentrates its investments in one country or region portfolio performance is expected to be closely tied to the social political and economic conditions in that country or region and may therefore be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified funds investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing the hsbc funds are subfunds of the hsbc global investment funds a luxembourg
