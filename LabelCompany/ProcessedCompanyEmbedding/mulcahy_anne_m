xeroxthe xerox ceo discusses the importance of honest communication cost cutting and not taking a dollar out of the research and development budgetdecember  by lisa vollmer email when anne mulcahy was named ceo of xerox corp in  many people were surprised — but no one was more surprised than mulcahy herself i took on this position feeling equal parts excitement and dread she recalled on the day that her appointment to ceo was announced the stock dropped  percent that was a real confidence builder she joked addressing a packed auditorium as part of the  view from the top speaker series mulcahy described the strategy behind the companys return to profitability or — as it was dubbed by money magazine — the great turnaround story of the postcrash era mulcahy candidly admitted that she had never planned on becoming the ceo let alone one who was expected to reverse the companys fortunes after a sustained period of underperformance although she had been at xerox for  years when she was appointed to the role she had spent  of those years in sales and much of her remaining tenure as the head of human resources and the chief of staff for former ceo paul allaire i certainly hadnt been groomed to become a ceo mulcahy said i didnt have a very sophisticated financial background and i had to make up for my lack of formal training i had to make up for it with intense onthejob learning that was an understatement when mulcahy took the helm in  xerox was teetering on the verge of chapter  bankruptcy the company had over  billion in debt and had recorded losses in each of the preceding six years a recent reorganization of the companys sales force had not gone according to plan customers were unhappy and the economy had started to falter on top of all of that xerox found itself in the middle of a protracted investigation by the securities and exchange commission of accounting improprieties in its mexico unit i like to say that we were early adopters of sec scandal mulcahy joked from the beginning mulcahy and her team devised a bold plan for recovery almost immediately she addressed the companys liquidity issues and quickly raised  billion in cash through a back to basics approach and a renewed focus on operational efficiency the company cut its capital expenditures by  percent reduced its sales general and administrative expenses by onethird and slashed its total debt in half all the while xerox strengthened its core business by maintaining an organizationwide focus on innovation even with all of the cost cutting we did we didnt take a dollar out of research and development mulcahy said mulcahy said that effective communication was perhaps the single most important component of the companys successful turnaround strategy i feel like my title should be chief communication officer because thats really what i do she said emphasizing the importance of listening to customers and employees when i became ceo i spent the first  days on planes traveling to various offices and listening to anyone who had a perspective on what was wrong with the company i think if you spend as much time listening as talking thats time well spent in addition to soliciting honest feedback mulcahy said both honesty and confidence are critical to effective communication especially during times of crisis when your organization is struggling you have to give people the sense that you know whats happening and that you have a strategy to fix it beyond that you have to tell people what they can do to help in return mulcahy accepted nothing less than total support from her executive team — or from any other xerox employee i gave people a choice to make either roll up your sleeves and go to work or leave xerox her nononsense noholdsbarred approach left her with a dedicated workforce uniquely aligned around a common set of objectives even when mulcahy wondered if her aggressive turnaround plan would work the resilience and optimism of xerox employees fueled her resolve — and her vision when employees asked her to describe what xerox would look like when it emerged from the turnaround mulcahy initially was incredulous i would think to myself why arent you asking me whether or not were going to make it nonetheless she committed her vision of the companys future to paper not with a traditional vision statement but with a fictitious wall street journal article describing xerox in the year  we outlined the things we hoped to accomplish as though we had already achieved them said mulcahy we included performance metrics — even quotes from wall street analysts it was really our vision of what we wanted the company to become xerox has gone a long way to making its vision a reality looking back on the article now id say weve already accomplished about  percent of things we set out to do she said when a student in the audience asked mulcahy what keeps her up at night these days her response reflected both her honesty and her resolve i think i am more motivated by fear of failure than a desire to succeed she admitted my experience at xerox has taught me that crisis is a very powerful motivator it forces you to make choices that you probably wouldnt have made otherwise it intensifies your focus your competitiveness your relentless desire to attain bestinclass status i want to do everything i can to make sure that we dont lose that now that were back on track leadership management email share thishttpstanfordiosaiovsign up for more insights and ideas for media inquiries visit the newsroomexplore more insights april

mulcahy pull off an ibmstyle makeover august    am edt if anne m mulcahy ever does manage to save xerox corp xrx  then surely june  will look like a turning point mulcahy president and ceoinwaiting flew from headquarters in stamford conn to rochester ny the home of xerox big operations to deliver devastating news the company was killing its entire line of desktop inkjet printersa oneyearold business that employed  people worldwide and had been championed by mulcahy herself the division would not turn a profit for at least two years though and xerox needed cash now in a year of tough decisions this one was toughest mulcahy says tough hardly does justice to the year xerox directors suddenly promoted mulcahy to president in may  after ousting g richard thoman who lasted all of  months and reinstalling chairman paul a allaire as ceo the company was close to foundering after years of weak sales and high costs employees were as disgruntled as customers then things went from bad to worse in october xerox reported its first quarterly loss in  years debt was piling up and the securities  exchange commission began investigating whether xerox used accounting tricks to boost income little in mulcahys past experience as vicepresident for human resources and chief staff officer to allaire had tested her in this kind of crisis management but she has impressed xerox directors as a decisive leader people close to mulcahy  expect shell soon be named ceo its a huge jump from senior executive to the chief executive slot says xerox director ralph larsen who heads johnson  johnson but he adds she has the strategic mind and toughness to serve as ceo on july  mulcahy was named ceo of xerox boxed in no doubt this will be a closely watched handover after all it was allaires botched succession planning that brought xerox to the low place it is today not only must mulcahy continue to shore up morale after thomans disastrous salesforce reorganization she also has to cut  billion from annual costs and thats just to get xerox to the point where she can make some real changes mulcahy believesas do most analyststhat xerox shouldnt be content just selling copiers or boxes in company lingo it has to focus on solutions that let corporations scan store and print digital documents tailored to their needs but the old guard is still resistant to succeed shell have to do away with more than the inkjet printers some people dont think shes up to it skeptics say mulcahy belongs to the old guard herself a veteran xeroid who started  years ago selling copiers they regard her as part of a past that weighs heavily on xerox a culture paralyzed by politics and earlier success moreover xerox is family to mulcahy her husband is a retired sales manager and her brother thomas j dolan is head of the global solutions group the good news or the bad news is she has the soul of xerox the risk is maybe shes too close to it says a consultant and xerox adviser mulcahy though says shes ready to shake up the culture there needs to be far more innovation and receptivity to new ideas i have very little time for endless debate and consensus today she has reestablished some sense of trust between employees and management no one talks about bankruptcy anymore and xerox operations are mending steadily operating losses in the first quartertypically xerox toughestwere far narrower than expected secondquarter losses contained no similar surprise coming in as forecast still the company faces enormous troubles even if it returns to profitability in the second half as it promises its bonds are rated junk by moodys investors service and it is still struggling to conserve cash and pay down its huge debta  billion loan is due next year cheerleader mulcahy who spoke briefly with businessweek is a hugely popular manager with years of experience dealing with customers but she hasnt been involved in product development and she doesnt have allaires financial expertise what got her the job of presidentand the chance to prove herself ready to be ceowas her smart decisionmaking as head of xerox  billion division for small office equipment she put together one of xerox biggest acquisitions the  million purchase of tektronix incs tek  colorprinting division now a source of fastgrowing revenues as important she proved fiercely protective of tektronix autonomy and even adopted some of its business practices the people who felt the most change were from xerox who said wait i thought we acquired them says gerald k perkel a tektronix veteran who is now a xerox senior vicepresident as president mulcahy has been chief cheerleader in a company where executives usually keep to themselves during her first three months she crisscrossed the country holding nearly two dozen meetings with employees she even promised to fly anywhere anytime to help salespeople close tough deals then when xerox financial situation worsened last september the company was forced to take drastic action with allaire fixated on repairing the balance sheet mulcahy focused on operations promising to slash  billion from xerox annual costs shes more than halfway there some  middle managers and factory workers have been let go she tries to make the announcements in person and she said shell reduce high manufacturing costs which have put xerox at a decided disadvantage to competitors such as canon inc caj  by  million xerox has not disclosed how close it is to that goal indeed only three years ago it tried to cut  billion but never got there meanwhile mulcahy spreads her message with a regular memo called turnaround talk which alternates between enthusiasm together we can do it and pragmatism when we shut off the bottled water its not because we want to be meanspirited its because all these little expensescan spell the difference between losing money and turning a profit mulcahy has raised the energy level at xerox a big bruce springsteen fan shes also a real gym rat mulcahy grew up in a long island ny household with four brothers her father was an editor in a publishing firm and her mother took care of the kids now her mom looks after her two teenage sons when she is away which is often since mulcahy is usually on the road three days a week she doesnt mind traveling even to hear criticism from employees but they better be prepared to hear some back she doesnt sugarcoat it says perkel today the company bills mulcahy as the future of xerox to her at least that means a xerox that looks more like ibm ibm  offering services to help businesses manage their vast cache of documents paul a ricci chairman of software maker scansoft inc table  and a former xerox exec says mulcahys push toward an ibm model makes sense what annes doing is smart which is to compete in the places where xerox is strong that is in large corporations of course this isnt the first time xerox has attempted an ibmlike makeover thoman couldnt manage it despite the fact he learned from the master at ibm louis v gerstner jr and the company has been trying to transform itself for two decades so why would mulcahy succeed its the nixoninchina phenomenon says david a nadler chairman of mercer delta consulting no one doubts her motives thoman after all was an outsider plus xerox has never been in as dire a condition as it is now the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up so maybe it will take a xeroid to dispose of the toxic parts of the companys culture that have made it so resistant to change theres an allout battle going on between boxes and solutions says james w lundy a gartner group inc consultant and exxeroid mulcahy is blunt about wanting her salespeople to learn to sell services too its the ability to walk and chew gum she says we cant be just the giant copier company ditto that by pamela l moore in new york before its here its on the bloomberg terminal learn more most read japan captures more photographs of

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
