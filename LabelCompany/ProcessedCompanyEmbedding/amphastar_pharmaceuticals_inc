share facebook google linkedin twitter email rss we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on developing manufacturing marketing and selling technicallychallenging generic and branded injectable and inhalation products  we currently manufacture and sell  products in the us and are developing a portfolio of  generic and  branded injectable and inhalation products that primarily target markets with high technical barriers to entry our largest product by net revenues is enoxaparin sodium injection the generic equivalent of sanofi’s lovenox  enoxaparin is a difficult to manufacture injectable form of low molecular weight heparin that is used as an anticoagulant which helps prevent the formation of blood clots in blood vessels commonly referred to as deep vein thrombosis enoxaparin is difficult to produce because the api is not easily obtained or manufactured we manufacture the api for our enoxaparin product and perform all other manufacturing of the finished product inhouse we believe that our enoxaparin product not only demonstrates our scientific capabilities of developing therapeutically equivalent generic versions of drugs with large complex molecules and overcoming numerous regulatory hurdles but it also demonstrates our capabilities in characterizing complex molecules our multiple technological capabilities enable the development of technicallychallenging products  these capabilities include characterizing complex molecules analyzing peptides proteins and dna conducting immunogenicity studies engineering particles and improving drug delivery through sustained release technology  these technological capabilities have enabled us to produce bioequivalent versions of complex drugs and support the development and manufacture of a broad range of dosage formulations including solutions emulsions suspensions and lyophilized products as well as products administered via metered dose inhalers or mdis and dry powder inhalers or dpis our primary focus is developing products for markets with high technical barriers to entry  we are specifically focused on applying our technical expertise to develop products that leverage our research and development capabilities require raw materials or an active pharmaceutical ingredient or api for which we believe we have a competitive advantage in sourcing synthesizing or manufacturing andor improve upon an existing drug’s formulation with respect to drug delivery safety andor efficiency to complement our internal growth and expertise we have made numerous strategic acquisitions of companies products and technologies that collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure including providing additional manufacturing marketing and research and development capabilities and the ability to manufacture raw materials apis and other components for our products   copyright   amphastar pharmaceuticals inc privacy      terms  conditions
