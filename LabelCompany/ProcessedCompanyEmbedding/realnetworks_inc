supp d  judge sitting marilyn hall patel case history subsequent actions no cvmhp  us dist lexis  nd cal january   antitrust claims dismissed case holding realnetworks violated the antitrafficking provisions of the digital millennium copyright act dmca by allowing users of realdvd software product to make permanent backup copies of copyrighted dvds a preliminary injunction was granted to forbid realnetworks from manufacturing and distributing realdvd or any other similar software product keywords digital millennium copyright act anticircumvention copyright realnetworks inc v dvd copy control association inc  f supp d   is a united states district court case involving realnetworks the movie studios and dvd copy control association regarding the digital millennium copyright act dmca claims on the manufacturing and distribution of realdvd and a breach of license agreement the district court concluded that realnetworks violated the anticircumvention and antitrafficking provisions of the dmca when the dvd copying software realdvd bypasses the copy protection technologies of dvd this lawsuit is one of the many legal actions taken by the movie studios in an attempt to restrict the copying of dvds contents  background  district court ruling  dmca claims on content scramble system  dmca claims on sony arccos and macrovision ripguard  realnetworks accused of evidence destruction  breach of license agreement  antitrust claims  subsequent development  related cases  see also  references backgroundedit this case involves the digital media company realnetworks dvd copy control association dvd cca and the major motion picture studios realnetworks licensed the content scramble system css a technology commonly used on copyrighted dvds to prevent unauthorized copying from dvd cca and released the product realdvd that allows users to make hard drive copies of copyrighted dvds however some major movie studios feel that realdvd can threaten the emerging market in digital downloads and encourage people to make copies of rental dvds instead of purchasing realnetworks on the other hand believes that copying of dvd is now legal after the favorable ruling of a  california superior court case against kaleidescape a manufacturer of highend media servers capable of copying copyrighted dvd content to the servers therefore realnetworks sued the dvd cca and several major movie studios on september   seeking for a declaratory judgment that realdvd neither violated the digital millennium copyright act dmca  usc §  nor breached the licensing contract with dvd cca on the same day the studios sued realnetworks by alleging that realnetworks violated the dmca and breached the contract district court rulingedit the district court issued a temporary restraining order on october   after the initial hearing of the case to prevent the sale and distribution of realdvd the temporary restraining order was turned into a preliminary injunction against realnetworks on august   by judge marilyn hall patel barring the manufacturing and distribution of realdvd or any other similar software product after the court found that realnetworks violated the dmca and breached the css licensing agreement with dvd cca dmca claims on content scramble systemedit the dmca prohibits circumvention of effective access control of copyrighted works and the trafficking of tools that are designed primarily to circumvent effective access control or copy control of copyrighted works realnetworks alleged that that css is not effective anymore because it has been cracked or hacked however the court ruled that the dmca statute does not require the access control or copy control technology to be strong as long as it prevents unauthorized access andor copying under ordinary course of operation and with the authority of the copyright owner since the court concluded that css is still effective for ordinary uses the dmca claim against realnetworks is valid the court decided that realdvd is primarily designed or produced to circumvent css technology in particular the court found that the removal of crucial css technology in dvd drivelocking secure storage of content keys on dvd css authentication and css bus encryption during the playback of copied dvd content from the hard dive is a circumvention of css even though they are not needed when playback from the hard drive the court further explained that even though realnetworks is a licensee of css technology it does not shield realnetworks from dmca claim because the removal of css technology is a violation of dmca dmca claims on sony arccos and macrovision ripguardedit realdvd also circumvented copy control measure in sony arccos protection and macrovision ripguard which are designed not to impair normal playback but to prevent copying by inserting intentional bad sectors and fake menu structures to the dvds by mimicking the way human watches a dvd or by skipping the unreadable data realnetworks contended that sony arccos and macrovision ripguard are not effective copy control measure because they only prolong the copying process the district court rejected this argument because arccos and ripguard may make copying take so long that copying is essentially not viable realnetworks then argued that arccos and ripguard are never encountered during normal playback leaving a back door to copying wide open thus they are not effective copy control measures but the court disagreed with this argument because if this is the law then effective copy protection measure will have to prevent against every possible current and future means of copying finally realnetworks asserted that regular dvd players can make temporary copies as cache so arccos and ripguard do not prevent copying

before the march   hearing the dvd copy control association inc wrote to us district judge marilyn hall patel that realnetworks had destroyed critical pieces of evidence and that this had irrevocably damaged the integrity of the judicial process the claim was that realnetworks knew from the start that what they were producing had a high likelihood of resulting in legal action so the company took measures to cover its tracks along the way the documentation of this released to the public was heavily redacted however it indicated that realnetworks intentionally eliminated engineering notebooks code files and documents that pointed to the fact that the realdvd software was mainly produced by hackers breach of license agreementedit realnetworks argued that it fully complied with the css license agreement not only by preserving all of the associated protection but also by adding advanced encryption system aes encryption to the copied content so that only the person who made the copy can play back the copied content with realnetworks player however the court decided that preserving the css protection only once during the initial playback of the dvd is not enough and any subsequent absence of css technology during the playback of copied dvd content from the hard drive is a contract violation antitrust claimsedit on may   realnetworks amended the lawsuit to include antitrust claims against dvd cca and the major studios alleging that the delayed product launch of realdvd temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction are the results of dvd cca and the movie studios conspiring to deny the licensing of css to make hard drive copies of dvd content however the court dismissed the claim because consumer can get the same hard drive copies through digital downloads and some dvds even come with an additional noncss encrypted dvd that allows the users to copy the content onto the hard drive also even if realnetworks is able to obtain a license to circumvent css realnetworks still violated the dmca for circumventing arccos and ripguard subsequent developmentedit in november  realnetworks filed an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit asking to remove the injunction on the sales of realdvd realnetworks claimed that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in granting a request by the major studios to halt

injunction against selling the realdvd software and a payment of  million in legal cost to the studios it would also refund the payments from the approximately  current users of realdvd despite the

patel case history subsequent actions no cvmhp  us dist lexis  nd cal january   antitrust claims dismissed case holding realnetworks violated the antitrafficking provisions of the digital millennium copyright act dmca by allowing users of realdvd software product to make permanent backup copies of copyrighted dvds a preliminary injunction was granted to forbid realnetworks from manufacturing and distributing realdvd or any other similar software product keywords digital millennium copyright act anticircumvention copyright realnetworks inc v dvd copy control association inc  f supp d   is a united states district court case involving realnetworks the movie studios and dvd copy control association regarding the digital millennium copyright act dmca claims on the manufacturing and distribution of realdvd and a breach of license agreement the district court concluded that realnetworks violated the anticircumvention and antitrafficking provisions of the dmca when the dvd copying software realdvd bypasses the copy protection technologies of dvd this lawsuit is one of the many legal actions taken by the movie studios in an attempt to restrict the copying of dvds contents  background  district court ruling  dmca claims on content scramble system  dmca claims on sony arccos and macrovision ripguard  realnetworks accused of evidence destruction  breach of license agreement  antitrust claims  subsequent development  related cases  see also  references backgroundedit this case involves the digital media company realnetworks dvd copy control association dvd cca and the major motion picture studios realnetworks licensed the content scramble system css a technology commonly used on copyrighted dvds to prevent unauthorized copying from dvd cca and released the product realdvd that allows users to make hard drive copies of copyrighted dvds however some major movie studios feel that realdvd can threaten the emerging market in digital downloads and encourage people to make copies of rental dvds instead of purchasing realnetworks on the other hand believes that copying of dvd is now legal after the favorable ruling of a  california superior court case against kaleidescape a manufacturer of highend media servers capable of copying copyrighted dvd content to the servers therefore realnetworks sued the dvd cca and several major movie studios on september   seeking for a declaratory judgment that realdvd neither violated the digital millennium copyright act dmca  usc §  nor breached the licensing contract with dvd cca on the same day the studios sued realnetworks by alleging that realnetworks violated the dmca and breached the contract district court rulingedit the district court issued a temporary restraining order on october   after the initial hearing of the case to prevent the sale and distribution of realdvd the temporary restraining order was turned into a preliminary injunction against realnetworks on august   by judge marilyn hall patel barring the manufacturing and distribution of realdvd or any other similar software product after the court found that realnetworks violated the dmca and breached the css licensing agreement with dvd cca dmca claims on content scramble systemedit the dmca prohibits circumvention of effective access control of copyrighted works and the trafficking of tools that are designed primarily to circumvent effective access control or copy control of copyrighted works realnetworks alleged that that css is not effective anymore because it has been cracked or hacked however the court ruled that the dmca statute does not require the access control or copy control technology to be strong as long as it prevents unauthorized access andor copying under ordinary course of operation and with the authority of the copyright owner since the court concluded that css is still effective for ordinary uses the dmca claim against realnetworks is valid the court decided that realdvd is primarily designed or produced to circumvent css technology in particular the court found that the removal of crucial css technology in dvd drivelocking secure storage of content keys on dvd css authentication and css bus encryption during the playback of copied dvd content from the hard dive is a circumvention of css even though they are not needed when playback from the hard drive the court further explained that even though realnetworks is a licensee of css technology it does not shield realnetworks from dmca claim because the removal of css technology is a violation of dmca dmca claims on sony arccos and macrovision ripguardedit realdvd also circumvented copy control measure in sony arccos protection and macrovision ripguard which are designed not to impair normal playback but to prevent copying by inserting intentional bad sectors and fake menu structures to the dvds by mimicking the way human watches a dvd or by skipping the unreadable data realnetworks contended that sony arccos and macrovision ripguard are not effective copy control measure because they only prolong the copying process the district court rejected this argument because arccos and ripguard may make copying take so long that copying is essentially not viable realnetworks then argued that arccos and ripguard are never encountered during normal playback leaving a back door to copying wide open thus they are not effective copy control measures but the court disagreed with this argument because if this is the law then effective copy protection measure will have to prevent against every possible current and future means of copying finally realnetworks asserted that regular dvd players can make temporary copies as cache so arccos and ripguard do not prevent copying however the court deemed this argument flawed by distinguishing that cache copies are byproduct of playback but copies made by realdvd are permanent realnetworks accused of evidence destructionedit

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object
