marketwired    spyr inc otcqb spyr received what should be viewed as a vote of confidence from cbs consumer products in a recently announced licensing deal between the two companies cbs is licensing its intellectual property ip from the longrunning star trek television series star trek the next generation star trek deep space nine and star trek voyager to spyr which can be taken as a vote of confidence by cbs consumer products in spyr and the synergy between cbss star trek ip and spyrs flagship freetoplay mmo game pocket starships cbs consumer products manages worldwide licensing and merchandising for a diverse slate of television brands and series from cbs cbs television studios and cbs television distribution as well as from the companys extensive library of titles showtime and cbs films in the deal cbs consumer products will allow for the incorporation of certain star trekbased content into pocket starships and given how wellknown and popular the science fiction franchise is a company like cbs is not going to ink a deal for its longstanding ip to just anyone spyrs management has a strong plan to not only use the ip effectively in pocket starships but to market and advertise the game well into the future as well by inking this deal with spyr cbs consumer products has shown it has confidence that spyr can effectively integrate star trek characters and possibly even various fighting ships from the franchise into pocket starships spyr is wasting no time developing the new content either the companys development team is already working on expansions of pocket starships to include the star trek ip globally there are millions of trekkies who seek out and buy up anything related to star trek so this new star trek content should serve as a great marketing tool and revenue generator for spyr as it continues to advertise and market pocket starships worldwide pocket starships is a true cross platform game so players can enjoy the star trek content with their friends and fellow trekkies no matter if theyre on their pc or on their mobile device  all at the same time imagine being a longtime fan of star trek and now being able to staff your ships in the game with your favorite characters from several of the television series with updates on the way that will thrust pocket starships into the competitive and fastgrowing electronic sports or esports arena the star trek ip could very well attract lots of esports gamers to choose pocket starships so incorporating star trek content should also serve as a marketing and revenue winner for spyr given that

sure to please trekkies around the universe spyr inc otcqb spyr announced this week that it has signed a licensing agreement with cbs consumer products that will allow spyr to incorporate intellectual property ip from various star trek television series in future updates to and expansions of the companys real time true cross platform mmo game pocket starshipsspyr has been making news lately for its release of a female centric mobile game to expand its gamer audience as well as its commitment to the esports industry the stock has reflected these pieces of news favorably showing a  percent jump this week alone from mondays low of the day and news of the agreement to incorporate star trek ip into pocket starships expansions is surely more good news for spyr investorslets face it  the star trek franchise remains extremely popular even decades after the show first aired on television so this was a brilliant deal to make on spyrs part and a deal that should gain its flagship game pocket starships even more players after spyr released news of the agreement with cbs consumer products the star trek website verified the news on its own website wwwstartrekcom later in the day star trek tweeted out the news to its more than  twitter followers httpstwittercomstartrek and star trek the next generation posted the news to its more than  million followers on facebook httpswwwfacebookcomstartrekthenextgeneration a quick search of the internet yielded some interesting numbers relative to the star trek franchise as of november   the entire star trek film franchise has grossed  billion at the box office domestically  billion adjusted for inflationthe star trek beyond edition released in  has grossed a worldwide box office of  million and domestic video sales of  million the appropriate question isnt how much has it grossed its how much is it worth according to cnbc in   the most current numbers we found  star trek was worth at that time approximately  billion dollarsclearly these numbers indicate a vast audience of star trek fans and combined with the growing market of mobile gaming which is expected to cross the  billion threshold in the next three years spyr has likely created a winning combination in their partnership with cbs consumer products for licensing of the star trek intellectual propertythe pocket starships development team is already working on expansions of pocket starships to include the star trek ip which spyr expects will be released by the end of october and according to the company this means that in november players of pocket starships will be able to explore new sectors and engage in exciting battles with a certain assimilating collective and will be able to staff their ships with their favorite star trek characters from the star trek tv series franchise star trek the next generation star trek deep space nine and star trek voyager through a trading card system expansionin yesterdays press release from spyr james r thompson spyrs ceo and president said we are very excited to announce that we have obtained a license to use star trek ip in pocket starships pocket starships and star trek are a perfect fit with both pocket starships and star trek celebrating a spirit of exploration and cooperation we think that star trek fans will enthusiastically embrace the new star trekbased content we will be adding to pocket starships we are confident that with pocket starships realtime crossplatform mmo gameplay together cbs consumer products and spyr can take pocket starships and star trek mobile games
