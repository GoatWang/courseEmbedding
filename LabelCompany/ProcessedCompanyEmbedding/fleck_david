comparison of mri brain scans of a bipolar patient top and a healthy patient bottomdavid fleckuniversity of cincinnati product development jun     share ai shoots down fighter planes treats bipolar disorder advancements in machine learning are leading to new ways of treating diseases the artificial intelligence that can blow human pilots out of the sky in airtoair combat accurately predicted treatment outcomes for bipolar disorder according to a new medical study by the university of cincinnati the findings open a world of possibility for using ai or machine learning to treat disease researchers saiddavid fleck an associate professor at the uc college of medicine and his coauthors used artificial intelligence called genetic fuzzy trees to predict how bipolar patients would respond to lithium bipolar disorder affects as many as six million adults in the united states or four percent of the adult population in a given yearin psychiatry treatment of bipolar disorder is as much an art as a science fleck said patients are fluctuating between periods of mania and depression treatments will change during those periods its really difficult to treat them appropriately during stages of the illnessthe study authors found that even the best of eight common models used in treating bipolar disorder predicted who would respond to lithium treatment with  percent accuracy by comparison the model uc researchers developed using ai predicted how patients would respond to lithium  percent of the time even more impressively the uc model predicted the actual reduction in manic symptoms after lithium treatment with 9 percent accuracyit turns out that the same kind of artificial intelligence that outmaneuvered air force pilots last year in simulation after simulation at wrightpatterson air force base is equally adept at making beneficial decisions that can help doctors treat disease the findings were published this month in the journal bipolar disorderswhat this shows is that an effort funded for aerospace is a gamechanger for the field of medicine and that is awesome said kelly cohen a professor in ucs college of engineering and applied science cohens doctoral graduate nicholas ernest is founder of the company psibernetix inc an artificial intelligence development and consultation company psibernetix is working on applications such as airtoair combat cybersecurity and predictive analytics ernests fuzzy logic algorithm is able to sort vast possibilities to arrive at the best choices in literally the blink of an eye normally the problems our ais solve have many many googolplexes of possible solutions  effectively infinite study coauthor ernest saidhis team developed a genetic fuzzy logic called alpha capable of shooting down human pilots in simulations even when the computers aircraft intentionally was handicapped with a slower top speed and less nimble flight characteristics the systems autonomous realtime decisionmaking shot down retired us air force col gene lee in every engagementit seemed to be aware of my intentions and reacting instantly to my changes in flight and my missile deployment lee said last year it knew how to defeat the shot i was taking it moved instantly between defensive and offensive actions as needed the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics honored cohen and ernest this year for their advancement and application of artificial intelligence to large scale meaningful and challenging aerospacerelated problemscohen spent much of his career working with fuzzylogic based ai in drones he used a sabbatical from the engineering college to approach the uc college of medicine with an idea what if they could apply the amazing predictive power of fuzzy logic to a particularly nettlesome medical problemmedicine and avionics have little in common but each entails an ordered process  a vast decision tree  to arrive at the best choices fuzzy logic is a system that relies not on specific definitions but generalizations to compensate for uncertainty or statistical noise this artificial intelligence is called genetic fuzzy because it constantly refines its answer tossing out the lesser choices in a way analogous to the genetic processes of darwinian natural selectioncohen compares it to teaching a child how to recognize a chair after seeing just a few examples any child can identify the object people sit in as a chair regardless of its shape size or colorwe do not require a large statistical database to learn we figure things out we do something similar to emulate that with fuzzy logic cohen saidcohen found a receptive audience in fleck who was working with ucs former center for imaging research after all who better to tackle one of medical sciences hardest problems than a rocket scientist cohen an aerospace engineer felt up to the taskernest said people should not conflate the technology with its applications the algorithm he developed is not a sentient being like the villains in the terminator movie franchise but merely a tool he said albeit a powerful one with seemingly endless applications i get emails and comments every week from wouldbe john connors out there who think this will lead to the end of the world ernest saidernests company created eve a genetic fuzzy ai that specializes in the creation of other genetic fuzzy ais eve came up with a predictive model for patient data called the lithium intelligent agent or lithia for the bipolar study this predictive model taps into the power of fuzzy logic to allow you to make a more informed decision ernest saidand unlike other types of ai fuzzy logic can describe in simple language why it made its choices he said the researchers teamed up with dr caleb adler the uc department of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience vice chairman of clinical research to examine bipolar disorder a common recurrent and often lifelong illness despite the prevalence of mood disorders their causes are poorly understood adler saidreally its a black box adler said we diagnose someone with bipolar disorder thats a description of their symptoms but that doesnt mean everyone has the same underlying causes selecting the appropriate treatment can be equally trickyover the past  years there has been an explosion of treatments for mania we have more options but we dont know who is going to respond to what adler said if we could predict who would respond better to treatment you would save time and consequences with appropriate care bipolar disorder is a manageable chronic illness for patients whose lives can return to normal he saiducs new study funded in part by a grant from the national institute of mental health identified  patients who were prescribed lithium for eight weeks to treat a manic episode fifteen of the  patients responded well to the treatmentthe algorithm used an analysis of two types of patient brain scans among other data to predict with  percent accuracy which patients responded well and which didnt and the algorithm also predicted the reductions in symptoms at eight weeks an achievement made even more impressive by the fact that only objective biological data were used for prediction rather than subjective opinions from experienced physiciansthis is a huge first step and ultimately something that will be very important to psychiatry and across medicine adler said how much potential does this have to revolutionize medicinei think its unlimited fleck said its a good result the best way to validate it is to get a new cohort of individuals and apply their data to the systemcohen is less reserved in his enthusiasm he said the model could help personalize medicine to individual patients like never before making health care both safer and more affordable fewer sideeffects means fewer hospital visits less secondary medication and better treatmentsnow the uc researchers and psibernetix are working on a new study applying fuzzy logic to diagnosing and treating concussions another condition that has bedeviled doctors the impact on society could be profound cohen said related product development boeing adds muscle to chinook product development

red door gallery in april  our ancestors presents portraits of city life as a collection of limited edition screenprints digital prints and d models from architect and illustrator david fleck his whimsically enchanting linear studies use a clean and fresh palette to celebrate trusted architectural forms as if they were built yesterday although void of perspective these city streets are layered creating an undulating wave of building facades and natural landscapes with a reassuring reminder of simpler times gone by although inspired by local towns and cities fleck’s final folio of works could well be associated with many international locations an idea discussed in italio calvino’s influential book invisible cities every city is a playground of discovery a world of chaos and experience waiting to be uncovered and shared the relationship between a cutting edge contemporary city and its people is of course reciprocal and influenced by the town planning and the priorities of our ancestors fleck’s cities depict this oxymoron by illustrating classical architecture in a contemporary style – a pairing down of complex structures to their most prominent features fleck captures the character of a population through an illustration of the city and characterizes a city through a drawing of one person it is in the combination that we find a portrait of city life david fleck is
