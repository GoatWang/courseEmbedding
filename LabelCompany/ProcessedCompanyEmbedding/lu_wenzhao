history which goes back to about  bc when it became known for its pottery production as one of the cities of origin of celadon in ancient china wenzhou was the capital of the ancient dongou kingdom  which existed from  bc until it was conquered by minyue kingdom in  bc imperial chinaedit in the early nd century bc shortly after the destruction of qin dynasty military and political leader zou yao  of wenzhou helped the emperor gaozu of han the first emperor of han dynasty defeat the prominent warlord xiang yu of qin dynasty after the victory emperor hui of han the second emperor of han dynasty named zhou yao the king of dongouwenzhou and under the administration of emperor hui wenzhou became the capital of the kingdom of dongou which is the now area of southern zhejiang province around ad in tang dynasty the founding emperor emperor gaozu of tang named yongkiaearlier as dongou by its current name wenzhou because of its mild weather modern eraedit throughout its history wenzhous traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern zhejiang province in early european sources the name wenzhoufu or foo was often transcribed ouentcheoufou after the accounts of frenchspeaking missionaries in  wenzhou was opened for tea exports but no foreign settlement was ever established there between  and  during the second sinojapanese war ie world war ii wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under chinese control it declined in the later years of the war but began to recover after coastal trade along the zhejiang coast was reestablished in  fengshui of wenzhou cityedit the geographical establishment and development of the city of wenzhou was designed by guo pu  the father of fengshui philosophical system in jin dynasty at the time in china mainly on the basis of fengshui philosophical system along with twentyeight mansions and five elements which develop and manage architecture and geography as a whole in metaphoric terms of invisible forces that unite the universe earth and humanity together when guo pu climbed to the top of west guo mountain in wenzhou he saw the range of mountains of wenzhou together shaped as dipper and the city itself aside from mountains shaped as key therefore wenzhou is now usually nicknamed as the dipper city based on the popular geographical saying of the city mountains as dipper city as key legends have it that during the time when wenzhou was being established and developed a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth therefore wenzhou is also nicknamed as deer city today the deer city districtlu cheng district is the name of downtown wenzhou and white deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals  only city in china designed by guo puedit wenzhou is the only city in china designed by the founder of fengshui philosophical system guo pu nowadays the local wenzhounese people usually see guo pu as the architect and founder of the city of wenzhou the locals changed the original name of the mountain west guo mountain that guo pu stood on to observe the city into guo gong mountain to honor guo pu at the bottom of guo gong mountain a temple was also built and named guo gong temple in  the local wenzhou government built and put up a statue of guo pu in downtown wenzhou being the only city in china and the world entirely designed by the pioneer of fengshui wenzhou is usually considered as the city in china with the best feng shui condition and nature other cities in china that are usually considered to possess excellent fengshui nature are beijing ili kazakh autonomous prefecture kunming hengyang and shenzhen however none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of fengshui or designed by the father of fengshui guo pu moreover wenzhou has an enormous cultural impact and influence on the history of china in the modern time people from all over china usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of wenzhounese as a result of wenzhous fengshui development by guo pu throughout its history wenzhou has avoided numerous militant activities that were originally set out to invade the city of wenzhou however none of them was successful for example during northern song dynasty when fangla revolution took place in the now zhejiang province where wenzhou city is located in the invading army that was planned to destroy the city of wenzhou surrounded it for over  days in hope of managing to invade the city however because of the establishment of wenzhou the mountainous isolation blocked the armys movement and the army ended up retreating instead such a phenomenon is now usually referred to as the result of the fengshui development of the city people of excellence and land of wisdomedit there is a popular saying in china that reflects the status of the city of wenzhou related to the fengshui of wenzhou which is people of excellence and land of wisdom as the local wenzhounese peoples are usually described in china as the people of excellence and the city of wenzhou is usually praised as the city of wisdom geographyedit on the coast of the

song dynasty in the th century nan opera also called as the wenzhou opera and yongjia opera was produced in wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional chinese opera in the history of china in its early stage of development nan opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in wenzhou influenced by yongjia school of thought wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in southern song dynasty expanded the influence of nan opera greatly since then nan opera gained its great influence in china and reached its peak in yuan dynasty and remained its prominent status in ming dynasty in the time period of late yuan dynasty the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave nan opera of wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development therefore in late yuan dynasty nan opera of wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in ming dynasty its original wenzhou tone of opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence and was mostly replaced by kun shan tone of opera later on because of the replacement in tone nan opera gradually transcended into its later form legend and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in ming dynasty birthplace of earliest onstage roledistribution system of chinese operaedit on the stage setting of a nan opera performance there are generally  role distribution elements life「 」、denier「」、ugliness「」、clarity「」、finale「」、exterior「」、attachment「」 with the main drama plot developed around life「 」and denier「」complemented usually by ugliness「」clarity「」 and finale「」 this stage setting system of nan opera invented in wenzhou with sevenelement role distribution principle is the earliest complete onstage role distribution principle system in the history of chinese opera four miracles of yuan dynastyedit although nan opera is the firstever mature form of traditional chinese opera throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of chinese opera nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early yuan dynasty who held great contempt for the southern chinese people despite the great resistance local wenzhounese that kept on developing nan drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the jing cha tale bai tu tale bai yue ting and sha gou ji which were later known as the four miracles of yuan dynasty according to modern studies at least half of the four miracles were entirely created by local wenzhounese artists with no nonlocal supplements and the other two consisting of some nonlocal supplements tale of the pipaedit tale of the pipatale of lute created by local wenzhounese gao ming is a work of nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in midyuan dynasty it is called as the connecting bridge of the time of nan opera and the time of legend the creation of tale of the pipa is among the greatest achievements of chinese opera and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional chinese opera and therefore it is usually called as the ancestor of all plays in china along with nan drama being called as the ancestor of all operas in china in the th century tale of the pipa was translated into english french german and latin ever since it was published in modern era the lute song has been significant in the history of western appreciation of chinese literature the first translation of lute song was published in  in paris by imprimerie royale written by antoine a p l bazin titled le pipaki ou lhistoire de luth making the history of the first legend play published in a western language in  american musical comedy based on tale of the pipa titled lute song written by will irwin sidney howard and starred yul brenner and mary martin was produced on broadway nancy reagan and lute songedit tale of the pipa is also the only broadway appearance of thenfuture first lady of the united states nancy reagan in the play of lute song nancy reagan dyed her brown hair black and slanted her eyes like a real oriental girl and the shows producer told her you look like you could be chinese like all the other nan opera plays written by local wenzhounese artists majorly in the original language of wenzhounese the lute song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera four forms of nan opera in ming dynastyedit after the invention of nan opera in wenzhou in the th century nan opera soon after started to spread its influence all across china as the firstever mature form of chinese opera at the time in ming dynasty the original form of nan opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into  different forms that were sung in  different tonesmelodies however some scholars today argue that nan opera in ming dynasty were sung in  different tonesmelodies the original nan opera gave births to four different forms of itself in ming dynasty hai yan tone yu yao tone kun shan tone and yi yang tone among the four forms the most popular one today is known as the kun opera that evolved from the kunshan tone of nan opera in ming dynasty kun opera is listed as one of the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by unesco since  home of mathematics in chinaedit wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern china are made by local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars in  the father of oracle bone script decipherment wenzhounese scholar sun yirang founded the firstever mathematics academy in the history of china ruian mathematics academy in wenzhou a year later in  local wenzhounese huang qingcheng founded the firstever periodical of mathematics in china suan xue bao in  a mathematical association was established in wenzhou named ruian heaven calculation association making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of china wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in china and the world it has given births to over  mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past  years according to numerous reports in the th century over onefourth to onethird of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over china were local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars during  international mathematical union conference in beijing a case study named analysis of vast communal formation of wenzhounese mathematicians was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world the goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance cultural influence of wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics the case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in china and around the world such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world in an interview with local wenzhounese mathematician one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern china su buqing conducted by wenzhounese science fiction writer ye yonglie many unknown details of the local wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed ye yonglie was told by su buqing that many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in china were local wenzhounese and in the conferences of international mathematical union the local language of wenzhounese is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language english moreover when ye yonglie asked su buqing whether the commonly shared wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming large yellow croaker was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians su buqing answered no no no its rather because of the fact that the entire area of wenzhou is too poor to do science and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math therefore most of the wenzhounese people just started to do math and then generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city establishment of higher education and hightech industry in taiwanedit wenzhounese mathematician shu shiensiu is today considered as the father of hightech industry in taiwan while the hightech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to taiwans economy when siu was the prime minister of ministry of science and technology from  to  he proposed to establish the hsinchu science and industrial park in hsinchu in  after sius evolutionary proposal rounds of debate about the location of hsinchu science and industrial park unfolded chiang chingkuo argued that the park should be built in longtan district in taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from national chungshan institute of science and technology and future relationship between the military field and the park however shu shiensiu argued that the park should be built in hsinchu because what taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economy power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military therefore siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park also longtan district was a relatively remote place as compared to hsinchu and thus the potential of park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in longtan district more importantly sius decision made in  is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park siu wanted the hsinchu science and industrial park to be like silicon valley which is adjacent to stanford university and university of california berkeley thinking differently from chiang chingkuo siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the hsinchu science and industrial park could benefit from the national tsing hua university and national chiao tung university therefore siu determined to manage to build the park in hsinchu where both universities are located at today hsinchu science and industrial park is commonly considered as the silicon valley of the orient and the hightech industry stands as the biggest contributor to taiwans economy mathematics education in taiwanedit in  shu shiensiu founded the department of mathematics at national tsing hua university arguably the most prestigious university of taiwan a year later in  siu founded the summer mathematics conference the firstever mathematical conference in the history of taiwan when siu became the president of national tsing hua university in  there were only  academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over  people including faculty members in order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of taiwan siu organised to establish the college of engineering that consists of  departments and expanded the institute of nuclear engineering and science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of  departments and  institute during  to  siu managed to employee a total of  professors with doctoral degree also during his presidency siu carried out the year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on construction of buildings on campus such as the department of chemistry the auditorium the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students by the time he left national tsing hua university in  the university had a total of  departments  colleges and  institutes with a student population of over including graduate students and academic staff population of over  in  after sius  years of presidency national tsing hua university placed st in all  fields of mathematics physics and chemistry in taiwan as siu was deeply influenced by the yongjia school of thought when he grew up in wenzhou during his presidential career at the university siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional chinese belief of the importance of theory and also made it clear that as students the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus one of the most influential quotes of siu is what we need the most are the practitioners who directly involve but not the theorists，， that main idea held by siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of yongjia school of thought the cultural gene of the city of wenzhou such a unique form of philosophy of siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on school and taiwans history as today national tsing hua university is known for its emphasis on practicality in taiwan culture and demographicsedit languageedit main article wenzhounese wenzhou natives speak a language of wu chinese the language family

the language is reputed to have been used during the second sinojapanese war during wartime communication and in sinovietnamese war for programming military cipher code due to its unique grammar

concentration of christians the city has been dubbed the jerusalem of the east or chinas jerusalem in some media reports in recent years the prominence of wanzhous christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action in  cnn reported that local communist party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than  church crosses more recent reports have updated the numbers to over  churches destroyed and  crosses removed the chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of christians pointing instead to violations of landuse regulations as the reason for its actions however independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism the new york times for example reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of christianity in the region specifically the times cites a ninepage statement of provincial policy singlingout the christian community as targets for the regulation of “excessive religious sites” and “overly popular” religious activities “the priority the document states is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways national highways and provincial highways” as well as to “over time and in batches bring down the crosses from the rooftops to the facade of the buildings” the provincial policy has met with some resistance a christian pastor who protested the removal of the crosses

impact on the mindset of wenzhou natives and has become the cultural gene in the economic development of wenzhou ever since business cultureedit due to both wenzhous cultural and geographical remoteness and its lack of natural resources land minerals etc the chinese central government has left the people of wenzhou relatively autonomous away from the center of the political and economic stage its people are more independent selfreliant and generally more business and family oriented numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from wenzhou hence when china switched from its planned economy to its socalled capitalist economy with chinese socialist characteristics in the late s its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it a popular

history which goes back to about  bc when it became known for its pottery production as one of the cities of origin of celadon in ancient china wenzhou was the capital of the ancient dongou kingdom  which existed from  bc until it was conquered by minyue kingdom in  bc imperial chinaedit in the early nd century bc shortly after the destruction of qin dynasty military and political leader zou yao  of wenzhou helped the emperor gaozu of han the first emperor of han dynasty defeat the prominent warlord xiang yu of qin dynasty after the victory emperor hui of han the second emperor of han dynasty named zhou yao the king of dongouwenzhou and under the administration of emperor hui wenzhou became the capital of the kingdom of dongou which is the now area of southern zhejiang province around ad in tang dynasty the founding emperor emperor gaozu of tang named yongkiaearlier as dongou by its current name wenzhou because of its mild weather modern eraedit throughout its history wenzhous traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern zhejiang province in early european sources the name wenzhoufu or foo was often transcribed ouentcheoufou after the accounts of frenchspeaking missionaries in  wenzhou was opened for tea exports but no foreign settlement was ever established there between  and  during the second sinojapanese war ie world war ii wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under chinese control it declined in the later years of the war but began to recover after coastal trade along the zhejiang coast was reestablished in  fengshui of wenzhou cityedit the geographical establishment and development of the city of wenzhou was designed by guo pu  the father of fengshui philosophical system in jin dynasty at the time in china mainly on the basis of fengshui philosophical system along with twentyeight mansions and five elements which develop and manage architecture and geography as a whole in metaphoric terms of invisible forces that unite the universe earth and humanity together when guo pu climbed to the top of west guo mountain in wenzhou he saw the range of mountains of wenzhou together shaped as dipper and the city itself aside from mountains shaped as key therefore wenzhou is now usually nicknamed as the dipper city based on the popular geographical saying of the city mountains as dipper city as key legends have it that during the time when wenzhou was being established and developed a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth therefore wenzhou is also nicknamed as deer city today the deer city districtlu cheng district is the name of downtown wenzhou and white deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals  only city in china designed by guo puedit wenzhou is the only city in china designed by the founder of fengshui philosophical system guo pu nowadays the local wenzhounese people usually see guo pu as the architect and founder of the city of wenzhou the locals changed the original name of the mountain west guo mountain that guo pu stood on to observe the city into guo gong mountain to honor guo pu at the bottom of guo gong mountain a temple was also built and named guo gong temple in  the local wenzhou government built and put up a statue of guo pu in downtown wenzhou being the only city in china and the world entirely designed by the pioneer of fengshui wenzhou is usually considered as the city in china with the best feng shui condition and nature other cities in china that are usually considered to possess excellent fengshui nature are beijing ili kazakh autonomous prefecture kunming hengyang and shenzhen however none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of fengshui or designed by the father of fengshui guo pu moreover wenzhou has an enormous cultural impact and influence on the history of china in the modern time people from all over china usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of wenzhounese as a result of wenzhous fengshui development by guo pu throughout its history wenzhou has avoided numerous militant activities that were originally set out to invade the city of wenzhou however none of them was successful for example during northern song dynasty when fangla revolution took place in the now zhejiang province where wenzhou city is located in the invading army that was planned to destroy the city of wenzhou surrounded it for over  days in hope of managing to invade the city however because of the establishment of wenzhou the mountainous isolation blocked the armys movement and the army ended up retreating instead such a phenomenon is now usually referred to as the result of the fengshui development of the city people of excellence and land of wisdomedit there is a popular saying in china that reflects the status of the city of wenzhou related to the fengshui of wenzhou which is people of excellence and land of wisdom as the local wenzhounese peoples are usually described in china as the people of excellence and the city of wenzhou is usually praised as the city of wisdom geographyedit on the coast of the

song dynasty in the th century nan opera also called as the wenzhou opera and yongjia opera was produced in wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional chinese opera in the history of china in its early stage of development nan opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in wenzhou influenced by yongjia school of thought wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in southern song dynasty expanded the influence of nan opera greatly since then nan opera gained its great influence in china and reached its peak in yuan dynasty and remained its prominent status in ming dynasty in the time period of late yuan dynasty the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave nan opera of wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development therefore in late yuan dynasty nan opera of wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in ming dynasty its original wenzhou tone of opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence and was mostly replaced by kun shan tone of opera later on because of the replacement in tone nan opera gradually transcended into its later form legend and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in ming dynasty birthplace of earliest onstage roledistribution system of chinese operaedit on the stage setting of a nan opera performance there are generally  role distribution elements life「 」、denier「」、ugliness「」、clarity「」、finale「」、exterior「」、attachment「」 with the main drama plot developed around life「 」and denier「」complemented usually by ugliness「」clarity「」 and finale「」 this stage setting system of nan opera invented in wenzhou with sevenelement role distribution principle is the earliest complete onstage role distribution principle system in the history of chinese opera four miracles of yuan dynastyedit although nan opera is the firstever mature form of traditional chinese opera throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of chinese opera nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early yuan dynasty who held great contempt for the southern chinese people despite the great resistance local wenzhounese that kept on developing nan drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the jing cha tale bai tu tale bai yue ting and sha gou ji which were later known as the four miracles of yuan dynasty according to modern studies at least half of the four miracles were entirely created by local wenzhounese artists with no nonlocal supplements and the other two consisting of some nonlocal supplements tale of the pipaedit tale of the pipatale of lute created by local wenzhounese gao ming is a work of nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in midyuan dynasty it is called as the connecting bridge of the time of nan opera and the time of legend the creation of tale of the pipa is among the greatest achievements of chinese opera and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional chinese opera and therefore it is usually called as the ancestor of all plays in china along with nan drama being called as the ancestor of all operas in china in the th century tale of the pipa was translated into english french german and latin ever since it was published in modern era the lute song has been significant in the history of western appreciation of chinese literature the first translation of lute song was published in  in paris by imprimerie royale written by antoine a p l bazin titled le pipaki ou lhistoire de luth making the history of the first legend play published in a western language in  american musical comedy based on tale of the pipa titled lute song written by will irwin sidney howard and starred yul brenner and mary martin was produced on broadway nancy reagan and lute songedit tale of the pipa is also the only broadway appearance of thenfuture first lady of the united states nancy reagan in the play of lute song nancy reagan dyed her brown hair black and slanted her eyes like a real oriental girl and the shows producer told her you look like you could be chinese like all the other nan opera plays written by local wenzhounese artists majorly in the original language of wenzhounese the lute song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera four forms of nan opera in ming dynastyedit after the invention of nan opera in wenzhou in the th century nan opera soon after started to spread its influence all across china as the firstever mature form of chinese opera at the time in ming dynasty the original form of nan opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into  different forms that were sung in  different tonesmelodies however some scholars today argue that nan opera in ming dynasty were sung in  different tonesmelodies the original nan opera gave births to four different forms of itself in ming dynasty hai yan tone yu yao tone kun shan tone and yi yang tone among the four forms the most popular one today is known as the kun opera that evolved from the kunshan tone of nan opera in ming dynasty kun opera is listed as one of the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by unesco since  home of mathematics in chinaedit wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern china are made by local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars in  the father of oracle bone script decipherment wenzhounese scholar sun yirang founded the firstever mathematics academy in the history of china ruian mathematics academy in wenzhou a year later in  local wenzhounese huang qingcheng founded the firstever periodical of mathematics in china suan xue bao in  a mathematical association was established in wenzhou named ruian heaven calculation association making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of china wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in china and the world it has given births to over  mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past  years according to numerous reports in the th century over onefourth to onethird of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over china were local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars during  international mathematical union conference in beijing a case study named analysis of vast communal formation of wenzhounese mathematicians was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world the goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance cultural influence of wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics the case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in china and around the world such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world in an interview with local wenzhounese mathematician one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern china su buqing conducted by wenzhounese science fiction writer ye yonglie many unknown details of the local wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed ye yonglie was told by su buqing that many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in china were local wenzhounese and in the conferences of international mathematical union the local language of wenzhounese is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language english moreover when ye yonglie asked su buqing whether the commonly shared wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming large yellow croaker was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians su buqing answered no no no its rather because of the fact that the entire area of wenzhou is too poor to do science and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math therefore most of the wenzhounese people just started to do math and then generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city establishment of higher education and hightech industry in taiwanedit wenzhounese mathematician shu shiensiu is today considered as the father of hightech industry in taiwan while the hightech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to taiwans economy when siu was the prime minister of ministry of science and technology from  to  he proposed to establish the hsinchu science and industrial park in hsinchu in  after sius evolutionary proposal rounds of debate about the location of hsinchu science and industrial park unfolded chiang chingkuo argued that the park should be built in longtan district in taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from national chungshan institute of science and technology and future relationship between the military field and the park however shu shiensiu argued that the park should be built in hsinchu because what taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economy power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military therefore siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park also longtan district was a relatively remote place as compared to hsinchu and thus the potential of park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in longtan district more importantly sius decision made in  is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park siu wanted the hsinchu science and industrial park to be like silicon valley which is adjacent to stanford university and university of california berkeley thinking differently from chiang chingkuo siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the hsinchu science and industrial park could benefit from the national tsing hua university and national chiao tung university therefore siu determined to manage to build the park in hsinchu where both universities are located at today hsinchu science and industrial park is commonly considered as the silicon valley of the orient and the hightech industry stands as the biggest contributor to taiwans economy mathematics education in taiwanedit in  shu shiensiu founded the department of mathematics at national tsing hua university arguably the most prestigious university of taiwan a year later in  siu founded the summer mathematics conference the firstever mathematical conference in the history of taiwan when siu became the president of national tsing hua university in  there were only  academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over  people including faculty members in order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of taiwan siu organised to establish the college of engineering that consists of  departments and expanded the institute of nuclear engineering and science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of  departments and  institute during  to  siu managed to employee a total of  professors with doctoral degree also during his presidency siu carried out the year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on construction of buildings on campus such as the department of chemistry the auditorium the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students by the time he left national tsing hua university in  the university had a total of  departments  colleges and  institutes with a student population of over including graduate students and academic staff population of over  in  after sius  years of presidency national tsing hua university placed st in all  fields of mathematics physics and chemistry in taiwan as siu was deeply influenced by the yongjia school of thought when he grew up in wenzhou during his presidential career at the university siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional chinese belief of the importance of theory and also made it clear that as students the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus one of the most influential quotes of siu is what we need the most are the practitioners who directly involve but not the theorists，， that main idea held by siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of yongjia school of thought the cultural gene of the city of wenzhou such a unique form of philosophy of siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on school and taiwans history as today national tsing hua

concentration of christians the city has been dubbed the jerusalem of the east or chinas jerusalem in some media reports in recent years the prominence of wanzhous christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action in  cnn reported that local communist party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than  church crosses more recent reports have updated the numbers to over  churches destroyed and  crosses removed the chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of christians pointing instead to violations of landuse regulations as the reason for its actions however independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism the new york times for example reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of christianity in the region specifically the times cites a ninepage statement of provincial policy singlingout the christian community as targets for the regulation of “excessive religious sites” and “overly popular” religious activities “the priority the document states is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways national highways and provincial highways” as well as to “over time and in batches bring down the crosses from the rooftops to the facade of the buildings” the provincial policy has met with some resistance a christian pastor who protested the removal of the crosses

stage its people are more independent selfreliant and generally more business and family oriented numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from wenzhou hence when china switched from its planned economy to its socalled capitalist economy with chinese socialist characteristics in the late s its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it a popular

history which goes back to about  bc when it became known for its pottery production as one of the cities of origin of celadon in ancient china wenzhou was the capital of the ancient dongou kingdom  which existed from  bc until it was conquered by minyue kingdom in  bc imperial chinaedit in the early nd century bc shortly after the destruction of qin dynasty military and political leader zou yao  of wenzhou helped the emperor gaozu of han the first emperor of han dynasty defeat the prominent warlord xiang yu of qin dynasty after the victory emperor hui of han the second emperor of han dynasty named zhou yao the king of dongouwenzhou and under the administration of emperor hui wenzhou became the capital of the kingdom of dongou which is the now area of southern zhejiang province around ad in tang dynasty the founding emperor emperor gaozu of tang named yongkiaearlier as dongou by its current name wenzhou because of its mild weather modern eraedit throughout its history wenzhous traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern zhejiang province in early european sources the name wenzhoufu or foo was often transcribed ouentcheoufou after the accounts of frenchspeaking missionaries in  wenzhou was opened for tea exports but no foreign settlement was ever established there between  and  during the second sinojapanese war ie world war ii wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under chinese control it declined in the later years of the war but began to recover after coastal trade along the zhejiang coast was reestablished in  fengshui of wenzhou cityedit the geographical establishment and development of the city of wenzhou was designed by guo pu  the father of fengshui philosophical system in jin dynasty at the time in china mainly on the basis of fengshui philosophical system along with twentyeight mansions and five elements which develop and manage architecture and geography as a whole in metaphoric terms of invisible forces that unite the universe earth and humanity together when guo pu climbed to the top of west guo mountain in wenzhou he saw the range of mountains of wenzhou together shaped as dipper and the city itself aside from mountains shaped as key therefore wenzhou is now usually nicknamed as the dipper city based on the popular geographical saying of the city mountains as dipper city as key legends have it that during the time when wenzhou was being established and developed a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth therefore wenzhou is also nicknamed as deer city today the deer city districtlu cheng district is the name of downtown wenzhou and white deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals  only city in china designed by guo puedit wenzhou is the only city in china designed by the founder of fengshui philosophical system guo pu nowadays the local wenzhounese people usually see guo pu as the architect and founder of the city of wenzhou the locals changed the original name of the mountain west guo mountain that guo pu stood on to observe the city into guo gong mountain to honor guo pu at the bottom of guo gong mountain a temple was also built and named guo gong temple in  the local wenzhou government built and put up a statue of guo pu in downtown wenzhou being the only city in china and the world entirely designed by the pioneer of fengshui wenzhou is usually considered as the city in china with the best feng shui condition and nature other cities in china that are usually considered to possess excellent fengshui nature are beijing ili kazakh autonomous prefecture kunming hengyang and shenzhen however none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of fengshui or designed by the father of fengshui guo pu moreover wenzhou has an enormous cultural impact and influence on the history of china in the modern time people from all over china usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of wenzhounese as a result of wenzhous fengshui development by guo pu throughout its history wenzhou has avoided numerous militant activities that were originally set out to invade the city of wenzhou however none of them was successful for example during northern song dynasty when fangla revolution took place in the now zhejiang province where wenzhou city is located in the invading army that was planned to destroy the city of wenzhou surrounded it for over  days in hope of managing to invade the city however because of the establishment of wenzhou the mountainous isolation blocked the armys movement and the army ended up retreating instead such a phenomenon is now usually referred to as the result of the fengshui development of the city people of excellence and land of wisdomedit there is a popular saying in china that reflects the status of the city of wenzhou related to the fengshui of wenzhou which is people of excellence and land of wisdom as the local wenzhounese peoples are usually described in china as the people of excellence and the city of wenzhou is usually praised as the city of wisdom geographyedit on the coast of the

song dynasty in the th century nan opera also called as the wenzhou opera and yongjia opera was produced in wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional chinese opera in the history of china in its early stage of development nan opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in wenzhou influenced by yongjia school of thought wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in southern song dynasty expanded the influence of nan opera greatly since then nan opera gained its great influence in china and reached its peak in yuan dynasty and remained its prominent status in ming dynasty in the time period of late yuan dynasty the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave nan opera of wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development therefore in late yuan dynasty nan opera of wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in ming dynasty its original wenzhou tone of opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence and was mostly replaced by kun shan tone of opera later on because of the replacement in tone nan opera gradually transcended into its later form legend and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in ming dynasty birthplace of earliest onstage roledistribution system of chinese operaedit on the stage setting of a nan opera performance there are generally  role distribution elements life「 」、denier「」、ugliness「」、clarity「」、finale「」、exterior「」、attachment「」 with the main drama plot developed around life「 」and denier「」complemented usually by ugliness「」clarity「」 and finale「」 this stage setting system of nan opera invented in wenzhou with sevenelement role distribution principle is the earliest complete onstage role distribution principle system in the history of chinese opera four miracles of yuan dynastyedit although nan opera is the firstever mature form of traditional chinese opera throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of chinese opera nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early yuan dynasty who held great contempt for the southern chinese people despite the great resistance local wenzhounese that kept on developing nan drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the jing cha tale bai tu tale bai yue ting and sha gou ji which were later known as the four miracles of yuan dynasty according to modern studies at least half of the four miracles were entirely created by local wenzhounese artists with no nonlocal supplements and the other two consisting of some nonlocal supplements tale of the pipaedit tale of the pipatale of lute created by local wenzhounese gao ming is a work of nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in midyuan dynasty it is called as the connecting bridge of the time of nan opera and the time of legend the creation of tale of the pipa is among the greatest achievements of chinese opera and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional chinese opera and therefore it is usually called as the ancestor of all plays in china along with nan drama being called as the ancestor of all operas in china in the th century tale of the pipa was translated into english french german and latin ever since it was published in modern era the lute song has been significant in the history of western appreciation of chinese literature the first translation of lute song was published in  in paris by imprimerie royale written by antoine a p l bazin titled le pipaki ou lhistoire de luth making the history of the first legend play published in a western language in  american musical comedy based on tale of the pipa titled lute song written by will irwin sidney howard and starred yul brenner and mary martin was produced on broadway nancy reagan and lute songedit tale of the pipa is also the only broadway appearance of thenfuture first lady of the united states nancy reagan in the play of lute song nancy reagan dyed her brown hair black and slanted her eyes like a real oriental girl and the shows producer told her you look like you could be chinese like all the other nan opera plays written by local wenzhounese artists majorly in the original language of wenzhounese the lute song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera four forms of nan opera in ming dynastyedit after the invention of nan opera in wenzhou in the th century nan opera soon after started to spread its influence all across china as the firstever mature form of chinese opera at the time in ming dynasty the original form of nan opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into  different forms that were sung in  different tonesmelodies however some scholars today argue that nan opera in ming dynasty were sung in  different tonesmelodies the original nan opera gave births to four different forms of itself in ming dynasty hai yan tone yu yao tone kun shan tone and yi yang tone among the four forms the most popular one today is known as the kun opera that evolved from the kunshan tone of nan opera in ming dynasty kun opera is listed as one of the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by unesco since  home of mathematics in chinaedit wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern china are made by local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars in  the father of oracle bone script decipherment wenzhounese scholar sun yirang founded the firstever mathematics academy in the history of china ruian mathematics academy in wenzhou a year later in  local wenzhounese huang qingcheng founded the firstever periodical of mathematics in china suan xue bao in  a mathematical association was established in wenzhou named ruian heaven calculation association making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of china wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in china and the world it has given births to over  mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past  years according to numerous reports in the th century over onefourth to onethird of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over china were local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars during  international mathematical union conference in beijing a case study named analysis of vast communal formation of wenzhounese mathematicians was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world the goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance cultural influence of wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics the case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in china and around the world such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world in an interview with local wenzhounese mathematician one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern china su buqing conducted by wenzhounese science fiction writer ye yonglie many unknown details of the local wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed ye yonglie was told by su buqing that many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in china were local wenzhounese and in the conferences of international mathematical union the local language of wenzhounese is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language english moreover when ye yonglie asked su buqing whether the commonly shared wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming large yellow croaker was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians su buqing answered no no no its rather because of the fact that the entire area of wenzhou is too poor to do science and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math therefore most of the wenzhounese people just started to do math and then generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city establishment of higher education and hightech industry in taiwanedit wenzhounese mathematician shu shiensiu is today considered as the father of hightech industry in taiwan while the hightech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to taiwans economy when siu was the prime minister of ministry of science and technology from  to  he proposed to establish the hsinchu science and industrial park in hsinchu in  after sius evolutionary proposal rounds of debate about the location of hsinchu science and industrial park unfolded chiang chingkuo argued that the park should be built in longtan district in taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from national chungshan institute of science and technology and future relationship between the military field and the park however shu shiensiu argued that the park should be built in hsinchu because what taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economy power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military therefore siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park also longtan district was a relatively remote place as compared to hsinchu and thus the potential of park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in longtan district more importantly sius decision made in  is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park siu wanted the hsinchu science and industrial park to be like silicon valley which is adjacent to stanford university and university of california berkeley thinking differently from chiang chingkuo siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the hsinchu science and industrial park could benefit from the national tsing hua university and national chiao tung university therefore siu determined to manage to build the park in hsinchu where both universities are located at today hsinchu science and industrial park is commonly considered as the silicon valley of the orient and the hightech industry stands as the biggest contributor to taiwans economy mathematics education in taiwanedit in  shu shiensiu founded the department of mathematics at national tsing hua university arguably the most prestigious university of taiwan a year later in  siu founded the summer mathematics conference the firstever mathematical conference in the history of taiwan when siu became the president of national tsing hua university in  there were only  academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over  people including faculty members in order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of taiwan siu organised to establish the college of engineering that consists of  departments and expanded the institute of nuclear engineering and science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of  departments and  institute during  to  siu managed to employee a total of  professors with doctoral degree also during his presidency siu carried out the year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on construction of buildings on campus such as the department of chemistry the auditorium the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students by the time he left national tsing hua university in  the university had a total of  departments  colleges and  institutes with a student population of over including graduate students and academic staff population of over  in  after sius  years of presidency national tsing hua university placed st in all  fields of mathematics physics and chemistry in taiwan as siu was deeply influenced by the yongjia school of thought when he grew up in wenzhou during his presidential career at the university siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional chinese belief of the importance of theory and also made it clear that as students the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus one of the most influential quotes of siu is what we need the most are the practitioners who directly involve but not the theorists，， that main idea held by siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of yongjia school of thought the cultural gene of the city of wenzhou such a unique form of philosophy of siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on school and taiwans history as today national tsing hua

concentration of christians the city has been dubbed the jerusalem of the east or chinas jerusalem in some media reports in recent years the prominence of wanzhous christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action in  cnn reported that local communist party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than  church crosses more recent reports have updated the numbers to over  churches destroyed and  crosses removed the chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of christians pointing instead to violations of landuse regulations as the reason for its actions however independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism the new york times for example reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of christianity in the region specifically the times cites a ninepage statement of provincial policy singlingout the christian community as targets for the regulation of “excessive religious sites” and “overly popular” religious activities “the priority the document states is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways national highways and provincial highways” as well as to “over time and in batches bring down the crosses from the rooftops to the facade of the buildings” the provincial policy has met with some resistance a christian pastor who protested the removal of the crosses

stage its people are more independent selfreliant and generally more business and family oriented numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from wenzhou hence when china switched from its planned economy to its socalled capitalist economy with chinese socialist characteristics in the late s its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it a popular

history which goes back to about  bc when it became known for its pottery production as one of the cities of origin of celadon in ancient china wenzhou was the capital of the ancient dongou kingdom  which existed from  bc until it was conquered by minyue kingdom in  bc imperial chinaedit in the early nd century bc shortly after the destruction of qin dynasty military and political leader zou yao  of wenzhou helped the emperor gaozu of han the first emperor of han dynasty defeat the prominent warlord xiang yu of qin dynasty after the victory emperor hui of han the second emperor of han dynasty named zhou yao the king of dongouwenzhou and under the administration of emperor hui wenzhou became the capital of the kingdom of dongou which is the now area of southern zhejiang province around ad in tang dynasty the founding emperor emperor gaozu of tang named yongkiaearlier as dongou by its current name wenzhou because of its mild weather modern eraedit throughout its history wenzhous traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern zhejiang province in early european sources the name wenzhoufu or foo was often transcribed ouentcheoufou after the accounts of frenchspeaking missionaries in  wenzhou was opened for tea exports but no foreign settlement was ever established there between  and  during the second sinojapanese war ie world war ii wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under chinese control it declined in the later years of the war but began to recover after coastal trade along the zhejiang coast was reestablished in  fengshui of wenzhou cityedit the geographical establishment and development of the city of wenzhou was designed by guo pu  the father of fengshui philosophical system in jin dynasty at the time in china mainly on the basis of fengshui philosophical system along with twentyeight mansions and five elements which develop and manage architecture and geography as a whole in metaphoric terms of invisible forces that unite the universe earth and humanity together when guo pu climbed to the top of west guo mountain in wenzhou he saw the range of mountains of wenzhou together shaped as dipper and the city itself aside from mountains shaped as key therefore wenzhou is now usually nicknamed as the dipper city based on the popular geographical saying of the city mountains as dipper city as key legends have it that during the time when wenzhou was being established and developed a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth therefore wenzhou is also nicknamed as deer city today the deer city districtlu cheng district is the name of downtown wenzhou and white deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals  only city in china designed by guo puedit wenzhou is the only city in china designed by the founder of fengshui philosophical system guo pu nowadays the local wenzhounese people usually see guo pu as the architect and founder of the city of wenzhou the locals changed the original name of the mountain west guo mountain that guo pu stood on to observe the city into guo gong mountain to honor guo pu at the bottom of guo gong mountain a temple was also built and named guo gong temple in  the local wenzhou government built and put up a statue of guo pu in downtown wenzhou being the only city in china and the world entirely designed by the pioneer of fengshui wenzhou is usually considered as the city in china with the best feng shui condition and nature other cities in china that are usually considered to possess excellent fengshui nature are beijing ili kazakh autonomous prefecture kunming hengyang and shenzhen however none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of fengshui or designed by the father of fengshui guo pu moreover wenzhou has an enormous cultural impact and influence on the history of china in the modern time people from all over china usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of wenzhounese as a result of wenzhous fengshui development by guo pu throughout its history wenzhou has avoided numerous militant activities that were originally set out to invade the city of wenzhou however none of them was successful for example during northern song dynasty when fangla revolution took place in the now zhejiang province where wenzhou city is located in the invading army that was planned to destroy the city of wenzhou surrounded it for over  days in hope of managing to invade the city however because of the establishment of wenzhou the mountainous isolation blocked the armys movement and the army ended up retreating instead such a phenomenon is now usually referred to as the result of the fengshui development of the city people of excellence and land of wisdomedit there is a popular saying in china that reflects the status of the city of wenzhou related to the fengshui of wenzhou which is people of excellence and land of wisdom as the local wenzhounese peoples are usually described in china as the people of excellence and the city of wenzhou is usually praised as the city of wisdom geographyedit on the coast of the

song dynasty in the th century nan opera also called as the wenzhou opera and yongjia opera was produced in wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional chinese opera in the history of china in its early stage of development nan opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in wenzhou influenced by yongjia school of thought wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in southern song dynasty expanded the influence of nan opera greatly since then nan opera gained its great influence in china and reached its peak in yuan dynasty and remained its prominent status in ming dynasty in the time period of late yuan dynasty the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave nan opera of wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development therefore in late yuan dynasty nan opera of wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in ming dynasty its original wenzhou tone of opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence and was mostly replaced by kun shan tone of opera later on because of the replacement in tone nan opera gradually transcended into its later form legend and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in ming dynasty birthplace of earliest onstage roledistribution system of chinese operaedit on the stage setting of a nan opera performance there are generally  role distribution elements life「 」、denier「」、ugliness「」、clarity「」、finale「」、exterior「」、attachment「」 with the main drama plot developed around life「 」and denier「」complemented usually by ugliness「」clarity「」 and finale「」 this stage setting system of nan opera invented in wenzhou with sevenelement role distribution principle is the earliest complete onstage role distribution principle system in the history of chinese opera four miracles of yuan dynastyedit although nan opera is the firstever mature form of traditional chinese opera throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of chinese opera nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early yuan dynasty who held great contempt for the southern chinese people despite the great resistance local wenzhounese that kept on developing nan drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the jing cha tale bai tu tale bai yue ting and sha gou ji which were later known as the four miracles of yuan dynasty according to modern studies at least half of the four miracles were entirely created by local wenzhounese artists with no nonlocal supplements and the other two consisting of some nonlocal supplements tale of the pipaedit tale of the pipatale of lute created by local wenzhounese gao ming is a work of nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in midyuan dynasty it is called as the connecting bridge of the time of nan opera and the time of legend the creation of tale of the pipa is among the greatest achievements of chinese opera and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional chinese opera and therefore it is usually called as the ancestor of all plays in china along with nan drama being called as the ancestor of all operas in china in the th century tale of the pipa was translated into english french german and latin ever since it was published in modern era the lute song has been significant in the history of western appreciation of chinese literature the first translation of lute song was published in  in paris by imprimerie royale written by antoine a p l bazin titled le pipaki ou lhistoire de luth making the history of the first legend play published in a western language in  american musical comedy based on tale of the pipa titled lute song written by will irwin sidney howard and starred yul brenner and mary martin was produced on broadway nancy reagan and lute songedit tale of the pipa is also the only broadway appearance of thenfuture first lady of the united states nancy reagan in the play of lute song nancy reagan dyed her brown hair black and slanted her eyes like a real oriental girl and the shows producer told her you look like you could be chinese like all the other nan opera plays written by local wenzhounese artists majorly in the original language of wenzhounese the lute song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera four forms of nan opera in ming dynastyedit after the invention of nan opera in wenzhou in the th century nan opera soon after started to spread its influence all across china as the firstever mature form of chinese opera at the time in ming dynasty the original form of nan opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into  different forms that were sung in  different tonesmelodies however some scholars today argue that nan opera in ming dynasty were sung in  different tonesmelodies the original nan opera gave births to four different forms of itself in ming dynasty hai yan tone yu yao tone kun shan tone and yi yang tone among the four forms the most popular one today is known as the kun opera that evolved from the kunshan tone of nan opera in ming dynasty kun opera is listed as one of the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by unesco since  home of mathematics in chinaedit wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern china are made by local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars in  the father of oracle bone script decipherment wenzhounese scholar sun yirang founded the firstever mathematics academy in the history of china ruian mathematics academy in wenzhou a year later in  local wenzhounese huang qingcheng founded the firstever periodical of mathematics in china suan xue bao in  a mathematical association was established in wenzhou named ruian heaven calculation association making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of china wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in china and the world it has given births to over  mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past  years according to numerous reports in the th century over onefourth to onethird of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over china were local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars during  international mathematical union conference in beijing a case study named analysis of vast communal formation of wenzhounese mathematicians was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world the goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance cultural influence of wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics the case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in china and around the world such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world in an interview with local wenzhounese mathematician one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern china su buqing conducted by wenzhounese science fiction writer ye yonglie many unknown details of the local wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed ye yonglie was told by su buqing that many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in china were local wenzhounese and in the conferences of international mathematical union the local language of wenzhounese is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language english moreover when ye yonglie asked su buqing whether the commonly shared wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming large yellow croaker was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians su buqing answered no no no its rather because of the fact that the entire area of wenzhou is too poor to do science and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math therefore most of the wenzhounese people just started to do math and then generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city establishment of higher education and hightech industry in taiwanedit wenzhounese mathematician shu shiensiu is today considered as the father of hightech industry in taiwan while the hightech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to taiwans economy when siu was the prime minister of ministry of science and technology from  to  he proposed to establish the hsinchu science and industrial park in hsinchu in  after sius evolutionary proposal rounds of debate about the location of hsinchu science and industrial park unfolded chiang chingkuo argued that the park should be built in longtan district in taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from national chungshan institute of science and technology and future relationship between the military field and the park however shu shiensiu argued that the park should be built in hsinchu because what taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economy power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military therefore siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park also longtan district was a relatively remote place as compared to hsinchu and thus the potential of park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in longtan district more importantly sius decision made in  is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park siu wanted the hsinchu science and industrial park to be like silicon valley which is adjacent to stanford university and university of california berkeley thinking differently from chiang chingkuo siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the hsinchu science and industrial park could benefit from the national tsing hua university and national chiao tung university therefore siu determined to manage to build the park in hsinchu where both universities are located at today hsinchu science and industrial park is commonly considered as the silicon valley of the orient and the hightech industry stands as the biggest contributor to taiwans economy mathematics education in taiwanedit in  shu shiensiu founded the department of mathematics at national tsing hua university arguably the most prestigious university of taiwan a year later in  siu founded the summer mathematics conference the firstever mathematical conference in the history of taiwan when siu became the president of national tsing hua university in  there were only  academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over  people including faculty members in order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of taiwan siu organised to establish the college of engineering that consists of  departments and expanded the institute of nuclear engineering and science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of  departments and  institute during  to  siu managed to employee a total of  professors with doctoral degree also during his presidency siu carried out the year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on construction of buildings on campus such as the department of chemistry the auditorium the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students by the time he left national tsing hua university in  the university had a total of  departments  colleges and  institutes with a student population of over including graduate students and academic staff population of over  in  after sius  years of presidency national tsing hua university placed st in all  fields of mathematics physics and chemistry in taiwan as siu was deeply influenced by the yongjia school of thought when he grew up in wenzhou during his presidential career at the university siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional chinese belief of the importance of theory and also made it clear that as students the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus one of the most influential quotes of siu is what we need the most are the practitioners who directly involve but not the theorists，， that main idea held by siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of yongjia school of thought the cultural gene of the city of wenzhou such a unique form of philosophy of siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on school and taiwans history as today national tsing hua

concentration of christians the city has been dubbed the jerusalem of the east or chinas jerusalem in some media reports in recent years the prominence of wanzhous christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action in  cnn reported that local communist party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than  church crosses more recent reports have updated the numbers to over  churches destroyed and  crosses removed the chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of christians pointing instead to violations of landuse regulations as the reason for its actions however independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism the new york times for example reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of christianity in the region specifically the times cites a ninepage statement of provincial policy singlingout the christian community as targets for the regulation of “excessive religious sites” and “overly popular” religious activities “the priority the document states is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways national highways and provincial highways” as well as to “over time

stage its people are more independent selfreliant and generally more business and family oriented numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from wenzhou hence when china switched from its planned economy to its socalled capitalist economy with chinese socialist characteristics in the late s its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it a popular

history which goes back to about  bc when it became known for its pottery production as one of the cities of origin of celadon in ancient china wenzhou was the capital of the ancient dongou kingdom  which existed from  bc until it was conquered by minyue kingdom in  bc imperial chinaedit in the early nd century bc shortly after the destruction of qin dynasty military and political leader zou yao  of wenzhou helped the emperor gaozu of han the first emperor of han dynasty defeat the prominent warlord xiang yu of qin dynasty after the victory emperor hui of han the second emperor of han dynasty named zhou yao the king of dongouwenzhou and under the administration of emperor hui wenzhou became the capital of the kingdom of dongou which is the now area of southern zhejiang province around ad in tang dynasty the founding emperor emperor gaozu of tang named yongkiaearlier as dongou by its current name wenzhou because of its mild weather modern eraedit throughout its history wenzhous traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern zhejiang province in early european sources the name wenzhoufu or foo was often transcribed ouentcheoufou after the accounts of frenchspeaking missionaries in  wenzhou was opened for tea exports but no foreign settlement was ever established there between  and  during the second sinojapanese war ie world war ii wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under chinese control it declined in the later years of the war but began to recover after coastal trade along the zhejiang coast was reestablished in  fengshui of wenzhou cityedit the geographical establishment and development of the city of wenzhou was designed by guo pu  the father of fengshui philosophical system in jin dynasty at the time in china mainly on the basis of fengshui philosophical system along with twentyeight mansions and five elements which develop and manage architecture and geography as a whole in metaphoric terms of invisible forces that unite the universe earth and humanity together when guo pu climbed to the top of west guo mountain in wenzhou he saw the range of mountains of wenzhou together shaped as dipper and the city itself aside from mountains shaped as key therefore wenzhou is now usually nicknamed as the dipper city based on the popular geographical saying of the city mountains as dipper city as key legends have it that during the time when wenzhou was being established and developed a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth therefore wenzhou is also nicknamed as deer city today the deer city districtlu cheng district is the name of downtown wenzhou and white deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals  only city in china designed by guo puedit wenzhou is the only city in china designed by the founder of fengshui philosophical system guo pu nowadays the local wenzhounese people usually see guo pu as the architect and founder of the city of wenzhou the locals changed the original name of the mountain west guo mountain that guo pu stood on to observe the city into guo gong mountain to honor guo pu at the bottom of guo gong mountain a temple was also built and named guo gong temple in  the local wenzhou government built and put up a statue of guo pu in downtown wenzhou being the only city in china and the world entirely designed by the pioneer of fengshui wenzhou is usually considered as the city in china with the best feng shui condition and nature other cities in china that are usually considered to possess excellent fengshui nature are beijing ili kazakh autonomous prefecture kunming hengyang and shenzhen however none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of fengshui or designed by the father of fengshui guo pu moreover wenzhou has an enormous cultural impact and influence on the history of china in the modern time people from all over china usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of wenzhounese as a result of wenzhous fengshui development by guo pu throughout its history wenzhou has avoided numerous militant activities that were originally set out to invade the city of wenzhou however none of them was successful for example during northern song dynasty when fangla revolution took place in the now zhejiang province where wenzhou city is located in the invading army that was planned to destroy the city of wenzhou surrounded it for over  days in hope of managing to invade the city however because of the establishment of wenzhou the mountainous isolation blocked the armys movement and the army ended up retreating instead such a phenomenon is now usually referred to as the result of the fengshui development of the city people of excellence and land of wisdomedit there is a popular saying in china that reflects the status of the city of wenzhou related to the fengshui of wenzhou which is people of excellence and land of wisdom as the local wenzhounese peoples are usually described in china as the people of excellence and the city of wenzhou is usually praised as the city of wisdom geographyedit on the coast of the

song dynasty in the th century nan opera also called as the wenzhou opera and yongjia opera was produced in wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional chinese opera in the history of china in its early stage of development nan opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in wenzhou influenced by yongjia school of thought wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in southern song dynasty expanded the influence of nan opera greatly since then nan opera gained its great influence in china and reached its peak in yuan dynasty and remained its prominent status in ming dynasty in the time period of late yuan dynasty the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave nan opera of wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development therefore in late yuan dynasty nan opera of wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in ming dynasty its original wenzhou tone of opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence and was mostly replaced by kun shan tone of opera later on because of the replacement in tone nan opera gradually transcended into its later form legend and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in ming dynasty birthplace of earliest onstage roledistribution system of chinese operaedit on the stage setting of a nan opera performance there are generally  role distribution elements life「 」、denier「」、ugliness「」、clarity「」、finale「」、exterior「」、attachment「」 with the main drama plot developed around life「 」and denier「」complemented usually by ugliness「」clarity「」 and finale「」 this stage setting system of nan opera invented in wenzhou with sevenelement role distribution principle is the earliest complete onstage role distribution principle system in the history of chinese opera four miracles of yuan dynastyedit although nan opera is the firstever mature form of traditional chinese opera throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of chinese opera nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early yuan dynasty who held great contempt for the southern chinese people despite the great resistance local wenzhounese that kept on developing nan drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the jing cha tale bai tu tale bai yue ting and sha gou ji which were later known as the four miracles of yuan dynasty according to modern studies at least half of the four miracles were entirely created by local wenzhounese artists with no nonlocal supplements and the other two consisting of some nonlocal supplements tale of the pipaedit tale of the pipatale of lute created by local wenzhounese gao ming is a work of nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in midyuan dynasty it is called as the connecting bridge of the time of nan opera and the time of legend the creation of tale of the pipa is among the greatest achievements of chinese opera and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional chinese opera and therefore it is usually called as the ancestor of all plays in china along with nan drama being called as the ancestor of all operas in china in the th century tale of the pipa was translated into english french german and latin ever since it was published in modern era the lute song has been significant in the history of western appreciation of chinese literature the first translation of lute song was published in  in paris by imprimerie royale written by antoine a p l bazin titled le pipaki ou lhistoire de luth making the history of the first legend play published in a western language in  american musical comedy based on tale of the pipa titled lute song written by will irwin sidney howard and starred yul brenner and mary martin was produced on broadway nancy reagan and lute songedit tale of the pipa is also the only broadway appearance of thenfuture first lady of the united states nancy reagan in the play of lute song nancy reagan dyed her brown hair black and slanted her eyes like a real oriental girl and the shows producer told her you look like you could be chinese like all the other nan opera plays written by local wenzhounese artists majorly in the original language of wenzhounese the lute song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera four forms of nan opera in ming dynastyedit after the invention of nan opera in wenzhou in the th century nan opera soon after started to spread its influence all across china as the firstever mature form of chinese opera at the time in ming dynasty the original form of nan opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into  different forms that were sung in  different tonesmelodies however some scholars today argue that nan opera in ming dynasty were sung in  different tonesmelodies the original nan opera gave births to four different forms of itself in ming dynasty hai yan tone yu yao tone kun shan tone and yi yang tone among the four forms the most popular one today is known as the kun opera that evolved from the kunshan tone of nan opera in ming dynasty kun opera is listed as one of the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by unesco since  home of mathematics in chinaedit wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern china are made by local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars in  the father of oracle bone script decipherment wenzhounese scholar sun yirang founded the firstever mathematics academy in the history of china ruian mathematics academy in wenzhou a year later in  local wenzhounese huang qingcheng founded the firstever periodical of mathematics in china suan xue bao in  a mathematical association was established in wenzhou named ruian heaven calculation association making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of china wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in china and the world it has given births to over  mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past  years according to numerous reports in the th century over onefourth to onethird of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over china were local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars during  international mathematical union conference in beijing a case study named analysis of vast communal formation of wenzhounese mathematicians was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world the goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance cultural influence of wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics the case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in china and around the world such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world in an interview with local wenzhounese mathematician one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern china su buqing conducted by wenzhounese science fiction writer ye yonglie many unknown details of the local wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed ye yonglie was told by su buqing that many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in china were local wenzhounese and in the conferences of international mathematical union the local language of wenzhounese is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language english moreover when ye yonglie asked su buqing whether the commonly shared wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming large yellow croaker was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians su buqing answered no no no its rather because of the fact that the entire area of wenzhou is too poor to do science and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math therefore most of the wenzhounese people just started to do math and then generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city establishment of higher education and hightech industry in taiwanedit wenzhounese mathematician shu shiensiu is today considered as the father of hightech industry in taiwan while the hightech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to taiwans economy when siu was the prime minister of ministry of science and technology from  to  he proposed to establish the hsinchu science and industrial park in hsinchu in  after sius evolutionary proposal rounds of debate about the location of hsinchu science and industrial park unfolded chiang chingkuo argued that the park should be built in longtan district in taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from national chungshan institute of science and technology and future relationship between the military field and the park however shu shiensiu argued that the park should be built in hsinchu because what taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economy power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military therefore siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park also longtan district was a relatively remote place as compared to hsinchu and thus the potential of park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in longtan district more importantly sius decision made in  is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park siu wanted the hsinchu science and industrial park to be like silicon valley which is adjacent to stanford university and university of california berkeley thinking differently from chiang chingkuo siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the hsinchu science and industrial park could benefit from the national tsing hua university and national chiao tung university therefore siu determined to manage to build the park in hsinchu where both universities are located at today hsinchu science and industrial park is commonly considered as the silicon valley of the orient and the hightech industry stands as the biggest contributor to taiwans economy mathematics education in taiwanedit in  shu shiensiu founded the department of mathematics at national tsing hua university arguably the most prestigious university of taiwan a year later in  siu founded the summer mathematics conference the firstever mathematical conference in the history of taiwan when siu became the president of national tsing hua university in  there were only  academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over  people including faculty members in order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of taiwan siu organised to establish the college of engineering that consists of  departments and expanded the institute of nuclear engineering and science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of  departments and  institute during  to  siu managed to employee a total of  professors with doctoral degree also during his presidency siu carried out the year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on construction of buildings on campus such as the department of chemistry the auditorium the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students by the time he left national tsing hua university in  the university had a total of  departments  colleges and  institutes with a student population of over including graduate students and academic staff population of over  in  after sius  years of presidency national tsing hua university placed st in all  fields of mathematics physics and chemistry in taiwan as siu was deeply influenced by the yongjia school of thought when he grew up in wenzhou during his presidential career at the university siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional chinese belief of the importance of theory and also made it clear that as students the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus one of the most influential quotes of siu is what we need the most are the practitioners who directly involve but not the theorists，， that main idea held by siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of yongjia school of thought the cultural gene of the city of wenzhou such a unique form of philosophy of siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on school and taiwans history as today national tsing hua

concentration of christians the city has been dubbed the jerusalem of the east or chinas jerusalem in some media reports in recent years the prominence of wanzhous christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action in  cnn reported that local communist party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than  church crosses more recent reports have updated the numbers to over  churches destroyed and  crosses removed the chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of christians pointing instead to violations of landuse regulations as the reason for its actions however independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism the new york times for example reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of christianity in the region specifically the times cites a ninepage statement of provincial policy singlingout the christian community as targets for the regulation of “excessive religious sites” and “overly popular” religious activities “the priority the document states is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways national highways and provincial highways” as well as to “over time

stage its people are more independent selfreliant and generally more business and family oriented numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from wenzhou hence when china switched from its planned economy to its socalled capitalist economy with chinese socialist characteristics in the late s its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it a popular

chinese  pinyin yǒngjiā wenzhou was a prosperous foreign treaty port which remains wellpreserved today it is situated in a mountainous region and as a result has been isolated for most of its history

history which goes back to about  bc when it became known for its pottery production as one of the cities of origin of celadon in ancient china wenzhou was the capital of the ancient dongou kingdom  which existed from  bc until it was conquered by minyue kingdom in  bc imperial chinaedit in the early nd century bc shortly after the destruction of qin dynasty military and political leader zou yao  of wenzhou helped the emperor gaozu of han the first emperor of han dynasty defeat the prominent warlord xiang yu of qin dynasty after the victory emperor hui of han the second emperor of han dynasty named zhou yao the king of dongouwenzhou and under the administration of emperor hui wenzhou became the capital of the kingdom of dongou which is the now area of southern zhejiang province around ad in tang dynasty the founding emperor emperor gaozu of tang named yongkiaearlier as dongou by its current name wenzhou because of its mild weather modern eraedit throughout its history wenzhous traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern zhejiang province in early european sources the name wenzhoufu or foo was often transcribed ouentcheoufou after the accounts of frenchspeaking missionaries in  wenzhou was opened for tea exports but no foreign settlement was ever established there between  and  during the second sinojapanese war ie world war ii wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under chinese control it declined in the later years of the war but began to recover after coastal trade along the zhejiang coast was reestablished in  fengshui of wenzhou cityedit the geographical establishment and development of the city of wenzhou was designed by guo pu  the father of fengshui philosophical system in jin dynasty at the time in china mainly on the basis of fengshui philosophical system along with twentyeight mansions and five elements which develop and manage architecture and geography as a whole in metaphoric terms of invisible forces that unite the universe earth and humanity together when guo pu climbed to the top of west guo mountain in wenzhou he saw the range of mountains of wenzhou together shaped as dipper and the city itself aside from mountains shaped as key therefore wenzhou is now usually nicknamed as the dipper city based on the popular geographical saying of the city mountains as dipper city as key legends have it that during the time when wenzhou was being established and developed a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth therefore wenzhou is also nicknamed as deer city today the deer city districtlu cheng district is the name of downtown wenzhou and white deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals  only city in china designed by guo puedit wenzhou is the only city in china designed by the founder of fengshui philosophical system guo pu nowadays the local wenzhounese people usually see guo pu as the architect and founder of the city of wenzhou the locals changed the original name of the mountain west guo mountain that guo pu stood on to observe the city into guo gong mountain to honor guo pu at the bottom of guo gong mountain a temple was also built and named guo gong temple in  the local wenzhou government built and put up a statue of guo pu in downtown wenzhou being the only city in china and the world entirely designed by the pioneer of fengshui wenzhou is usually considered as the city in china with the best feng shui condition and nature other cities in china that are usually considered to possess excellent fengshui nature are beijing ili kazakh autonomous prefecture kunming hengyang and shenzhen however none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of fengshui or designed by the father of fengshui guo pu moreover wenzhou has an enormous cultural impact and influence on the history of china in the modern time people from all over china usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of wenzhounese as a result of wenzhous fengshui development by guo pu throughout its history wenzhou has avoided numerous militant activities that were originally set out to invade the city of wenzhou however none of them was successful for example during northern song dynasty when fangla revolution took place in the now zhejiang province where wenzhou city is located in the invading army that was planned to destroy the city of wenzhou surrounded it for over  days in hope of managing to invade the city however because of the establishment of wenzhou the mountainous isolation blocked the armys movement and the army ended up retreating instead such a phenomenon is now usually referred to as the result of the fengshui development of the city people of excellence and land of wisdomedit there is a popular saying in china that reflects the status of the city of wenzhou related to the fengshui of wenzhou which is people of excellence and land of wisdom as the local wenzhounese peoples are usually described in china as the people of excellence and the city of wenzhou is usually praised as the city of wisdom geographyedit on the coast of the

song dynasty in the th century nan opera also called as the wenzhou opera and yongjia opera was produced in wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional chinese opera in the history of china in its early stage of development nan opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in wenzhou influenced by yongjia school of thought wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in southern song dynasty expanded the influence of nan opera greatly since then nan opera gained its great influence in china and reached its peak in yuan dynasty and remained its prominent status in ming dynasty in the time period of late yuan dynasty the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave nan opera of wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development therefore in late yuan dynasty nan opera of wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in ming dynasty its original wenzhou tone of opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence and was mostly replaced by kun shan tone of opera later on because of the replacement in tone nan opera gradually transcended into its later form legend and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in ming dynasty birthplace of earliest onstage roledistribution system of chinese operaedit on the stage setting of a nan opera performance there are generally  role distribution elements life「 」、denier「」、ugliness「」、clarity「」、finale「」、exterior「」、attachment「」 with the main drama plot developed around life「 」and denier「」complemented usually by ugliness「」clarity「」 and finale「」 this stage setting system of nan opera invented in wenzhou with sevenelement role distribution principle is the earliest complete onstage role distribution principle system in the history of chinese opera four miracles of yuan dynastyedit although nan opera is the firstever mature form of traditional chinese opera throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of chinese opera nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early yuan dynasty who held great contempt for the southern chinese people despite the great resistance local wenzhounese that kept on developing nan drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the jing cha tale bai tu tale bai yue ting and sha gou ji which were later known as the four miracles of yuan dynasty according to modern studies at least half of the four miracles were entirely created by local wenzhounese artists with no nonlocal supplements and the other two consisting of some nonlocal supplements tale of the pipaedit tale of the pipatale of lute created by local wenzhounese gao ming is a work of nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in midyuan dynasty it is called as the connecting bridge of the time of nan opera and the time of legend the creation of tale of the pipa is among the greatest achievements of chinese opera and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional chinese opera and therefore it is usually called as the ancestor of all plays in china along with nan drama being called as the ancestor of all operas in china in the th century tale of the pipa was translated into english french german and latin ever since it was published in modern era the lute song has been significant in the history of western appreciation of chinese literature the first translation of lute song was published in  in paris by imprimerie royale written by antoine a p l bazin titled le pipaki ou lhistoire de luth making the history of the first legend play published in a western language in  american musical comedy based on tale of the pipa titled lute song written by will irwin sidney howard and starred yul brenner and mary martin was produced on broadway nancy reagan and lute songedit tale of the pipa is also the only broadway appearance of thenfuture first lady of the united states nancy reagan in the play of lute song nancy reagan dyed her brown hair black and slanted her eyes like a real oriental girl and the shows producer told her you look like you could be chinese like all the other nan opera plays written by local wenzhounese artists majorly in the original language of wenzhounese the lute song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera four forms of nan opera in ming dynastyedit after the invention of nan opera in wenzhou in the th century nan opera soon after started to spread its influence all across china as the firstever mature form of chinese opera at the time in ming dynasty the original form of nan opera sung in wenzhounese lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into  different forms that were sung in  different tonesmelodies however some scholars today argue that nan opera in ming dynasty were sung in  different tonesmelodies the original nan opera gave births to four different forms of itself in ming dynasty hai yan tone yu yao tone kun shan tone and yi yang tone among the four forms the most popular one today is known as the kun opera that evolved from the kunshan tone of nan opera in ming dynasty kun opera is listed as one of the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by unesco since  home of mathematics in chinaedit wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern china are made by local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars in  the father of oracle bone script decipherment wenzhounese scholar sun yirang founded the firstever mathematics academy in the history of china ruian mathematics academy in wenzhou a year later in  local wenzhounese huang qingcheng founded the firstever periodical of mathematics in china suan xue bao in  a mathematical association was established in wenzhou named ruian heaven calculation association making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of china wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in china and the world it has given births to over  mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past  years according to numerous reports in the th century over onefourth to onethird of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over china were local wenzhounese mathematicians and scholars during  international mathematical union conference in beijing a case study named analysis of vast communal formation of wenzhounese mathematicians was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world the goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance cultural influence of wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics the case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in china and around the world such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world in an interview with local wenzhounese mathematician one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern china su buqing conducted by wenzhounese science fiction writer ye yonglie many unknown details of the local wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed ye yonglie was told by su buqing that many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in china were local wenzhounese and in the conferences of international mathematical union the local language of wenzhounese is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language english moreover when ye yonglie asked su buqing whether the commonly shared wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming large yellow croaker was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians su buqing answered no no no its rather because of the fact that the entire area of wenzhou is too poor to do science and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math therefore most of the wenzhounese people just started to do math and then generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city establishment of higher education and hightech industry in taiwanedit wenzhounese mathematician shu shiensiu is today considered as the father of hightech industry in taiwan while the hightech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to taiwans economy when siu was the prime minister of ministry of science and technology from  to  he proposed to establish the hsinchu science and industrial park in hsinchu in  after sius evolutionary proposal rounds of debate about the location of hsinchu science and industrial park unfolded chiang chingkuo argued that the park should be built in longtan district in taoyuan considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from national chungshan institute of science and technology and future relationship between the military field and the park however shu shiensiu argued that the park should be built in hsinchu because what taiwan and the park needed was creativity and private economy power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military therefore siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park also longtan district was a relatively remote place as compared to hsinchu and thus the potential of park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in longtan district more importantly sius decision made in  is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park siu wanted the hsinchu science and industrial park to be like silicon valley which is adjacent to stanford university and university of california berkeley thinking differently from chiang chingkuo siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the hsinchu science and industrial park could benefit from the national tsing hua university and national chiao tung university therefore siu determined to manage to build the park in hsinchu where both universities are located at today hsinchu science and industrial park is commonly considered as the silicon valley of the orient and the hightech industry stands as the biggest contributor to taiwans economy mathematics education in taiwanedit in  shu shiensiu founded the department of mathematics at national tsing hua university arguably the most prestigious university of taiwan a year later in  siu founded the summer mathematics conference the firstever mathematical conference in the history of taiwan when siu became the president of national tsing hua university in  there were only  academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over  people including faculty members in order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of taiwan siu organised to establish the college of engineering that consists of  departments and expanded the institute of nuclear engineering and science by transforming it into the college of nuclear science which consists of  departments and  institute during  to  siu managed to employee a total of  professors with doctoral degree also during his presidency siu carried out the year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on construction of buildings on campus such as the department of chemistry the auditorium the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students by the time he left national tsing hua university in  the university had a total of  departments  colleges and  institutes with a student population of over including graduate students and academic staff population of over  in  after sius  years of presidency national tsing hua university placed st in all  fields of mathematics physics and chemistry in taiwan as siu was deeply influenced by the yongjia school of thought when he grew up in wenzhou during his presidential career at the university siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional chinese belief of the importance of theory and also made it clear that as students the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus one of the most influential quotes of siu is what we need the most are the practitioners who directly involve but not the theorists，， that main idea held by siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of yongjia school of thought the cultural gene of the city of wenzhou such a unique form of philosophy of siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on school and taiwans history as today national tsing hua

concentration of christians the city has been dubbed the jerusalem of the east or chinas jerusalem in some media reports in recent years the prominence of wanzhous christian community has made it the target of some controversial government action in  cnn reported that local communist party authorities had demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than  church crosses more recent reports have updated the numbers to over  churches destroyed and  crosses removed the chinese government denies that the demolition of churches constitutes persecution of christians pointing instead to violations of landuse regulations as the reason for its actions however independent human rights groups and news agencies have met this denial with skepticism the new york times for example reported that internal government documents the newspaper had obtained revealed that these demolitions represented part of a deliberate strategy to reduce the public profile of christianity in the region specifically the times cites a ninepage statement of provincial policy singlingout the christian community as targets for the regulation of “excessive religious sites” and “overly popular” religious activities “the priority the document states is to remove crosses at religious activity sites on both sides of expressways national highways and provincial highways” as well as to “over time
