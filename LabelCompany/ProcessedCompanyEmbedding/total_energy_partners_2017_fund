mike krimbill our ceo for his remarks mike krimbill thanks trey and thank you everyone for being here i would like to start out with some of the accomplishments in ‘ the main one of course grand mesa was online on schedule in november if you recall those are deadlines supported by contracts of approximately  years of length all fee based with upside for additional noncommitted volumes as the base this production grows the rig count has doubled in the dj we have talked about what we are seeing on the water side as the indicator but production is not yet online and we expect to see that definitely in the second half of the year if not – the fiscal year if not sooner beginning in june as you know bonanza creek was having some difficulty they emerged from bankruptcy they are planning on adding a rig this summer and we have a contract for their volume for the next  years so that turned out as well as i think it could be we also – as you know we have been moving to get as much feebased business as we can in contracted business we placed the houma terminal in service and this is a blending terminal with a major oil company as a partner we also completed the port of comfort texas terminal which is between the ship channel and corpus this is an export terminal supported by contracted volumes and we are fortunate to purchase at a very attractive multiple the murphy assets at port hudson and kingfisher port hudson is supported by a year contract to supply butane that’s a natural gasoline for gasoline blending kingfisher is in kingfisher county which is where the new stack pipeline will originate that we are also building and that takes a wide grade product and also offspec condensate we are expanding the splitter that takes that condensate so that asset we expect to exceed our projections in addition we leased some additional assets on the refined products side at collins from tlp so for gasoline blending and other things we can do there that’s the last point on colonial as you head north where you can get in and out of colonial to receive also injections and then we have leased now i think we are up to  million barrels of storage in the midcon and so we are providing some services in the midcontinent for refined that are not part of the original leased assets from tlp so we think we have set the stage for the future i would like to go and explore a little bit this line space issue that we had in ‘ as you know we purchased about  barrels of cycle which is  barrels a day last july we did so in order to accommodate our customers’ growth we want to grow with our customers rather than have them go to competitors and try to add additional volumes unfortunately line space values kind of deconnected from the historical values we very much like the line space colonial sitting there in a great position you are seeing increasing demand for gasoline in the southeast it’s the lowest cost transportation up to the new york harbor we still are committed to the line space we feel like it was perhaps a year issue and not a systemic change in the line space values when we talk about values it’s basically the difference between the gulf coast pricing and the harbor pricing less the tariff to get from the gulf coast to new york what happened last winter was really a january february march i will say a phenomenon at this point where we had elevated exports in the gulf coast which we got to kept the gulf coast price up and therefore the difference between gulf coast and new york harbor did not expand as it normally would we wanted to give you some idea of the magnitude especially those of you who are modeling we initially of course the entire model line space we purchased which will be allocated to customers as we renew contracts and they see an increase in demand but at  barrels a day you can calculate pretty easily that would be  gallons at a  it’s about  million for each  so if you had budgeted in the  or  range i think it ended up at negative  that’s a   change in that  would have been that times  million so you are looking at  million to  million on that what we call discretionary line space that we purchased we also have a few contracts that have a line space component so we also were receiving a lower margin from a few of our customers so every  between the discretionary line space and what we have in our customer contracts is  million to  million of ebitda so if you have negative on your line space obviously if we had budgeted  and it went to negative   that’s about  million basically you can get a feel for how that impacts us we currently are seeing in this first quarter in line space the defects is really line  gasoline it’s probably averaging at minus  in this first quarter when you look at the second – our second third and then fourth which is the first quarter of ‘ we are seeing line space values flat to plus  we believe that these line space values are going to go back to historical norms we are seeing the exports at this time lower than they were a year ago we are seeing the mexican refineries increase their refinery runs which would mean less demand for the gulf coast so the indicators we believe are the line space will get back to the historical numbers even though we think that we are still looking to change our business model in case that doesn’t happen so there are a number of things we can do one thing we are going to do is talk with some of our customers it’s not in anyone’s benefit for us to lose money obviously you can’t do that longterm as an extreme action you could actually just stop shipping and give up your line space so you don’t lose anything so we are looking at that and i know we are going to – we will need to get back to historical norms and we will be making some changes or both i want to talk about the company outlook for ‘ i think big picture how do we get from  to  big picture is that’s really crude oil which is a full year grand mesa murphy as we said point comfort houma plus the dramatic increase in ebitda on the water side so i would like to talk about the individual pieces the retail business and to some extent liquids are affected predominantly by weather so in this year’s forecast on the  million to  million we have budgeted for a warmer slightly warmer than normal winter not as warm as last year but warmer than normal so we have pulled back our volumes and we have actually decreased margins by  in our east coast business so we feel good about that if you got normal weather we would exceed our number on retail on the liquids side we have done the same thing clearly on the wholesale propane when you have warm weather we are not selling as much propane to the retail customers we are – you will see our volumes are up but that’s because we are having to take the volume that should have gone to retail and then sell it into the hubs at little or no profit so we are trying to be conservative on that side normal weather we would do very very well on our liquids business as well refined we have also decreased our budget there for the line space impact we have some real nice upsides i think in all these businesses obviously weather on the first two refined we have some blending that we are going to be doing in the collins storage that we leased from tlp and we move onto the crude crude is going to be i think a real positive area here we have budgeted our crude on the committed volumes at a – about  a barrel instead of which is where we are currently – what we are currently getting when we are the shipper water has indicated to us that the crude demand – the crude production is about to increase dramatically in the dj for instance where we will be a beneficiary in our pipeline but we have downticked our expectations in transportation marketing because we don’t see recovery in the next quarter or two quarters but we are seeing the recoveries probably going to happen in the fourth quarter for sure maybe the third quarter so why did we say that and i think plains has also indicated i think the second half of the year is going to be much stronger we have the indicator which is water so we are seeing dramatic increases in our water business in particular our water volumes and let me start by saying water was in the low s  million ebitda for this – for the year behind us in our forecast on forward we have budgeted  million so it’s an increase of almost  that  million budget obviously we have projections of volume meaning water disposal by quarter we are already at the projection today of what we are projecting for september so our volumes – so we have pretty high confidence in water hitting our number or doing better but the rig counts increased in the permian and the dj in particular our water volumes are i think last year we averaged about  barrels a day we are already averaging over  and with what’s in the pipeline we can see our way easily to  next quarter and possibly  barrels a day by the end of the year none of – our budget it is in the  million is – are below those numbers so what’s going to happen with all this water obviously crude production will come behind because they are drilling these wells and then they will start completing these pads so we expect the crude business in the second half of the year to improve and the differentials are going to improve on the crude we shipped we think transportation obviously will start improving as there is more – there are more barrels to ship we have already seen an increase in drivers’ wages that are driving water trucks in certain areas it’s gone from like  dollars to about  we haven’t seen that increase yet on the crude side but we know that’s coming as there is more crude to transport so we are being more conservative i guess on our forecast here we see really upsides everywhere but this ‘ was – every business had a factor that really put it behind the  ball i would say whether it was weather for retail and liquids the line space values for refined rig counts at alltime lows low crude oil prices those – all of those things are reversing with the exception of weather and we will know that next winter but i think we have had two of the warmest winters in history back to back our guys have performed very well there is not a whole lot we knew about the volumes but margins have increased nicely you can see that on our numbers but as you know we don’t want to lose customers so we are pulling those margins back for this year when we will see what happens with respect to growth we clearly have a lot i think of excess capacity we spent a lot of money in water for instance we have a lot of disposal wells that can accept even more water our current capacity in those basins we are in is about  million barrels a day that will probably over this next  months  months become  million barrels a day so as production increases and rigs which is really rigs being placed in the service when we are seeing dj and permian we will hopefully we will see the eagle ford pickup more we don’t have to drill any more wells for the most part we just have to fill up what we already have so which is – i mean it’s bad that that’s where we are today but it’s good that we don’t need to spend much capital going forward to take advantage of the increased business we have tried to keep our customers and i think you see most of our volumes are the same or up now we just need to get to the profitability up i would say in the liquids business we have actually added some pretty significant customers for this fiscal year that’s a tough business margins are down there because the excess of railcars and the liquids anticipated liquids production predominantly out of the marcellus that didn’t happen the retail business we added some businesses last year i think we had three real nice regional players in the eastern us we are finishing the integration of those businesses and we will just be opportunistic on that side but i think trey will talk about capex but really the message is low capex focus on the balance sheet and just add volumes and increase margins as the midstream and upstream business recover so with that trey back to you trey karlovich alright thanks mike so i will be going over our financing activities financial results for the quarter and the full year which we released this morning as well as providing our full guidance for fiscal  as mike mentioned we have made some significant accomplishments during the year we have also accomplished many of our goals from a financing perspective and we’ll continue to place our focus on building a stronger balance sheet and maintaining adequate liquidity we have spoken in the past about our financing goals during the fourth quarter we were able to amend and extend our credit facility to october  issue  million of unsecured notes that mature in  and issued approximately  million in common equity through our february offering and prior to that under our atm the results were revamped balance sheet with significant liquidity reduced secured debt extended debt maturities and a better debt to equity balance we will continue to work diligently from a finance perspective to decrease our leverage and maintain ample liquidity as we target compliance leverage of x to x or better distribution coverage of x or better and a low cost of capital to fund our growth opportunities in the future looking at the results for the quarter and the full year we had approximately  million of adjusted ebitda this quarter and have reported approximately  million for the full year our quarterly results included the following impacts initial production volumes for demands at creek on the grand mesa pipeline which began on january  under our new agreement with them grand mesa has performed very well averaging  barrels per day for the quarter with over  barrels flowing today on the pipeline and growing every month since startup we continue to be excited about these projects and the opportunities that presents for us to grow our volumes on the pipeline and our presence in the dj basin we have seen a continued ramp in volumes in our water business as mike discussed and we exited the month of march with a runrate of about  million in ebitda and we have shown continued growth in volumes through april we have now included our volumes by basin in our earnings release and we will also include this information on a goforward basis we started operations at our houma terminal in louisiana during the quarter and also closed on the port hudson and kingfisher assets which we acquired from murphy in early january those assets along with the new terminal at the port of point comfort will provide incremental earnings for fiscal  and we are excited about the initial results as mike mentioned unfortunately mother nature played a role on our results with us recorded what we believe to be the second warmest winter on record for the past  years following closely behind last year’s winter which was the absolute warmest on record our retail propane and liquids businesses were impacted by about  million in total based on our estimates due to lower demand for volumes and steep decline of propane prices from january through the end of march which primarily impacted our wholesale margins we are basing our future forecast on rolling averages so you will see that we have lowered our expectations for these businesses for the upcoming year in addition to managing one of the warmest winters on record we were also impacted by the unusually depressed line space and basis differentials on the colonial pipeline which impacted our contracted and discretionary margins in the refined products business our margins for the quarter were slightly below  per gallon on the gasoline basis in this business compared to a forecasted margin of slightly over  per gallon for the quarter our diesel and biodiesel business also had reduced margins for the quarter including negative margins in bio driven by expected changes to governmental regulations and tax incentives since the election in november lastly the crude logistics business continues to face margin competition we do expect to see better performance as mike mentioned from this business going forward and with the new assets coming online continued stabilization of the crude market and increasing rig counts in our core basins however this will take at least a couple of quarters before we start to see that recovery to go through each business in a little bit more detail our refined products business generated  million of adjusted ebitda during the quarter and a  million for fiscal  we are expecting the segment to generate over  million of ebitda for the fiscal year and we were on track through december however the line space impact combined with a falloff in biodiesel values and margins which cannot be perfectly hedged resulted in approximately  million shortfall to budget mike mentioned some of the reasons we continue to believe that our position of line space will benefit us over the longterm however we do continue to see weakness in this business during the first part of fiscal  our target ebitda for this business is  million for fiscal  on the expectation that line space values and gulf to new york harbor basis differentials steadily recover through this summer and ultimately return to historical levels we are also expecting increased gasoline demand in the east higher diesel demand especially in the areas who have increased the drilling activity and stabilization of the renewables business our water business has continued to improve throughout the year as we recognized adjusted ebitda of over  million for the quarter  million for the year and we exited the quarter with an  million annualized runrate for the month of march overall volumes have grown  since the same quarter last year and about  from our low which was the first quarter of fiscal  we are expecting a higher growth percentage this upcoming year driven by higher rig counts and additional flowback volumes permian dj basin eagle ford and bakken volumes are all increasing with the majority of the growth in the dj and the delaware we are targeting  million in ebitda for fiscal  which is based on the crude curve that averages about  per barrel for the fiscal year the crude logistics business generated about  million of adjusted ebitda during the quarter and  million for fiscal  with grand mesa operational for  months and contributing over  million of ebitda over the past two quarters the marketing division continues to support grand mesa and our various other assets which we expect will continue to operate at near breakeven levels if not slight losses for the next couple of years we recently started operations at the houma terminal in louisiana and a terminal of the port of point comfort begins operations in early fiscal  we have forecasted minimal contango margins for the upcoming year looking at fiscal  we expect grand mesa to contribute  million of ebitda and the rest of the crude segment to breakeven with upside potential as differentials and margins expand with increased production in the back half of the fiscal year retail propane generated about  million of adjusted ebitda for the quarter and  million for the year quite the feat in lieu of the warm winter demand was well under budget for the year however we were able to maintain margins and reduce operating costs our forecasts for the upcoming year have been adjusted based on our volume models which utilized the most recent  to year actual volumes for each district we are currently budgeting  million of ebitda in fiscal  for this business based on these updated volume projections which would allow for more upside should there be a normal winter next year this does include a full year of operations for the acquisitions that mike discussed earlier and no anticipated acquisitions are included in this ebitda projection finally our liquids segment was also impacted by the weather and resulting decrease in demand for and the price of propane during the quarter adjusted ebitda for this business was  million for the quarter and  million for the year significantly below expectations coming into the fourth quarter our wholesale propane business saw the biggest impact while our butane and storage businesses also came in under forecast due to lower margins mainly due to high cost rail cars and competitive pricing we are expecting this business to benefit from the recent murphy acquisition which we closed in january and we expect that acquisition to generate about  million for this fiscal year our fiscal  budget for this entire business is  million would include the full year of the murphy assets a partial recovery in the propane and butane businesses and consistent earnings from sawtooth compared to fiscal  additionally we expect our overhead costs to be about  million for the upcoming year and based on each business segment and these overhead costs our adjusted ebitda guidance for fiscal  is between  million to  million our growth capex expectation for fiscal  is between  million to  million with the majority related to our stack extension on glass mountain and continued growth in our water business primarily in the delaware basin and focused on strategic locations and gathering opportunities these projects are not expected to contribute earnings of any significance until fiscal year  our distributable cash flow for the quarter was  million and has totaled approximately  million for the past  months resulting in a trailing month coverage of about x the low end of our targeted coverage level which includes the distributions on our class a preferred units based on the seasonality of our business this coverage will decrease over the next two quarters at our current distribution level however we do expect it to stay above x on a ttm basis during that time and to recover to above x in the latter half of the year our compliance leverage at march  was about x compared to our covenant leverage of x this is obviously higher than we anticipated and we will continue to focus on our balance sheet and opportunities to reduce leverage throughout fiscal  our board expects our compliance leverage to be approximately x before approving an increase in our distributions and management continues to target compliance leverage x to x or better over the longterm the pro forma adjustments to compliance ebitda includes approximately  million related to the grand mesa project and about  million to  million related to other projects and acquisitions completed during the past year these leverage metrics exclude our working capital facility which is governed by our borrowing base determined by our receivables and inventories this facility was approximately  million at march   as our propane inventories declined through the winter months as a reminder this facility is excluded from our covenant calculations to wrap up we did not have the quarter we expected we are working harder than ever to improving our performance and deliver value to our stakeholders we are making changes in the way we operate our business including adding more stable fee based cash flows and optimizing our existing assets and we fully expect to see these changes benefit our bottom line earnings as we have stated previously we will continue to focus on our balance sheet and safely operating our assets as we position our business for the future we appreciate your interest and support and we will now open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of torrey schultz with rbc capital markets torrey schultz hi guys good morning just i guess first on the retail propane so you are budgeting a warmer winter for  you added some new business over the past year and i think the budgeted cash flow is up call it  in  versus  so are you essentially budgeting similar weather over the past  year or  years i am just trying to understand you are talking about upside from a normal winter just kind of what the degree of magnitude of that upside potential is mike krimbill so tj what we did this year is not go back to normal instead we took the last  years so we had two of the warmest in a normal and averaged those three and that’s where we got our margins and our volumes so i know if you had – i don’t know what these three let’s say we were down just mathematically   and normal one of the years then you would have  divided by  so you would be down about  from normal torrey schultz okay mike krimbill so we – historically we have always kind of gone back to what normal is but now i guess our belief in what is normal is shaken so now we are using the last year actual torrey schultz got it and then on the line space issue kind of moving over to refined just kind of help walk through kind of in your guidance how you are stepping up that line space value through the year and kind of what the ultimate value is and what gives you comfort to kind of move that back up that you are seeing in the market right now trey karlovich so tj we have started off the year obviously as mike mentioned it’s – line space is still slightly negative today our budget has line space essentially zero to the start of the year and averaging  for the entire year versus historicals where it’s averaged slightly above  so we are expecting the line space to recover particularly in the second half of the year but we are starting to see slowly but surely that the line space move back in the right direction but it is still negative today mike krimbill so to add to that tj our fourth quarter so first calendar ‘ line space values are positive i think its   our third quarter it’s positive it’s flat second so those are the actual quotes out there that we are watching as we said the import – the exports out of the gulf are declining the mexican refining runs are increasing we have seen a lot of a number of ships i will say a lot a number of ships diverted from the harbor i think we just need to see some draws in harbor gasoline and so everything is pointing to which we didn’t expect obviously until the driving season started which is coming up here pretty quickly so we don’t see a systemic change yet and we are – the indicators are we will get back to historical numbers torrey schultz okay understood and just lastly on grand mesa you have got contracted volumes and my understanding is you have got potential for kind of walkup volumes they are just what you are seeing now or what are your expectations and guidance for kind of that walkup volume piece on grand mesa trey karlovich so our guidance assumes that walkup volumes averaged about  barrels a day for the year we are seeing somewhere in this  to  barrels a day today obviously our rate is slightly lower than what we had originally forecasted based on our full rate our guidance would be around  million so we have reduced that slightly for this upcoming fiscal year but we are optimistic as differentials are getting better as mike mentioned the rig counts doubled we are seeing significantly higher volumes in water which will lead to higher crude volumes so we feel pretty confident that the volumes will be there the question will be at what rate mike krimbill so we just checked last night our june walkup volumes exceeding our budget by about  actually more than the walkup pieces but more than that but the – all of our producers that will have commitments with us have added rigs and we are also – it’s really a geographic play so the other producers in the north have – of the basin have also added rigs so in a clearly – we are seeing that in the waters so it’s just not our word for it you might say so last year we were probably averaging what do you think  a day or in water trey karlovich in water in the dj around that mike krimbill around  we are double that today so we know all these rigs are at work we know they are drilling and what we haven’t seen the big pad come on yet so that is – when that happens obviously we are going to be able to ship more from all our producers and we are going to see much less pressure on prices as folks who are not – producers who are not meeting their mvcs are out there competing for barrels and it’s driving the differentials low so once all that – everyone is producing what their mvc as it takes the pressure off those differentials torrey schultz got it alright that’s it for me thank you operator thanks tj operator instructions our next question comes from the line of lin shen with hite matt niblack hi this is actually matt thanks for taking the question so just to give us a sense when you look at your liquids and propane segment if it were to get something closer to like a year average or a year average winter how much ebitda would that add trey karlovich so just on the wholesale business – so on retail it’s probably  or so so call it  million upside potential on the wholesale business so that business is typically call it  million to  million a year business it’s probably  to  on that business as well so i think a normal winter is an incremental  based on forecast obviously this year we were impacted by the much warmer winter and then the propane phenomenon which impacted our wholesale business negatively during the quarter matt niblack so the total between the two segments will be worth about  million trey karlovich yes i would say about  million upside to our – to the guidance matt niblack i am sorry  or  trey karlovich   million to the guidance but significantly more than that to this current year so current year we estimated that the impact for weather alone was about  million between wholesale and retail matt niblack got it and then the water so you said in your guidance that the sort of the guided water number was below the level of volumes that you are actually expecting based on activity on the ground right now in your projections so do you have a sense like if that trend continues how much upside that could be to your guidance trey karlovich i wish i could tell you we spend a lot of time looking at trying to quantify upside but unfortunately we are trying to limit the downside matt niblack limit the downside yes we appreciate that trey karlovich okay right we were looking at couple of quarters ago i think we mentioned we’d run some models say what do you need to get  million and  million ebitda and as i recall the  million was close to  barrels a day for the entire year so we will end the – and we anticipate ending the year at  so if you just said the average  maybe its  million to  million on water for this year and it would be a  million for a full year matt niblack got it okay and then you said that you are breaking even on the sort of crude logistics i guess the tracking business what are the underlying assumptions on pricing there and is there upside or downside to that mike krimbill so this one i did look at yesterday we have assumed no change in trucking revenues so no increase in pricing which we are seeing on the water trucking side so that would be a positive and then we would expect to see more volumes we have held our volumes flat so the other piece of transportation is the tows and barges historically those rates – the day rates have been  today we dropped our budget to  a day we are seeing some lower day rates out there but we think that’s doable so in total the upside is we looked instead if we got a  increase in rates and then more fully utilized i can’t say how much more that was but in total that was going to increase ebitda probably i don’t know maybe  million if you recall we sold off half of our truck fleet last year when things – when the downturn was at its worst matt niblack right okay thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of selman akyol with stifel selman akyol thank you two quick ones for me first of all you discussed little bit on in terms of drivers’ wages increasing and i am wondering first of all are you seeing any other wage pressures throughout and then is there any ability to pass that along as i guess most people expect trucking demands to increase across the basins mike krimbill yes we are seeing probably the same thing that the producers are saying we our water personnel in the field are probably being recruited by the upstream guys to run rigs because i think there is an issue with having enough labor on that side so we have increased our wages in certain basins by  –  to  an hour so we are seeing some of that on the flipside is we are seeing there is some pricing – some increase in pricing it’s – as i look at it we have been very i think fair with our customers and producers as you know in the dj we reduced the mvc volumes in the first  years in return for a longer contract we did the same thing on the water side we reduced rates we got bumped the same pressure everyone else did and so we all kind of shared the pain so now that we are seeing some recovery that we are seeing the producers willing to accept some price increase so i don’t see wage pressures we do see that but it don’t see it reducing ebitda selman akyol very good and then more of a housekeeping question on the dcf statement your interest expense of  million and then your cash interest expense of  million seemed to be a little bit wider than what we have been thinking so i was wondering was there something going on there trey karlovich some of that’s timing and amortization of debt cost we do expect that that interest expense number will be higher than that on a runrate basis for fiscal ‘ we are modeling between  million and  million of interest cost for fiscal ‘ and it’s pretty ratable quarteroverquarter selman akyol alright thank you operator our next question comes from indiscernible unidentified analyst hey thanks trey i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your comment during the prepared remarks about the compliance leverage being quite close relative to the covenant level what are the implication to that for example you have got growth capex you need to fund are there things you are going to look to do in order to create some more room since obviously people always gets nervous when mlps get close to debt covenant levels trey karlovich right that’s obviously something we are tied to our covenant we do have – again we are trying to be pretty conservative on our overall guidance based on our current debt levels we need to generate pro forma ebitda of about  million to be compliant as i walk through we are over that as of march  we expect to be compliant to the rest of the year but it will be tight and that’s something that we will be managing obviously our growth capital spending is not significant this year the goal for that will be to – we do get some pro forma credit for growth opportunities obviously we have our atm which we could utilize to manage that growth capital spending as well but that’s something that we will be paying very close attention to throughout the year unidentified analyst okay so bottom line is you don’t think you are going to be in a position where you are not going to be in compliant with the covenant but it may constrain you a little bit in terms of how you finance things trey karlovich correct unidentified analyst okay operator operator instructions we have a question from the line of kali ramachandran with state street capital kali ramachandran hi a followup on the prior person’s question are you in discussions with your bank group to loosen the covenants and if not why not trey karlovich we do have ongoing discussions with our bank group we obviously have provided them with our forecasts and our expectations and we will continue to work closely with the group so… kali ramachandran so right now you are not in any discussions with them about loosening covenants at this stage because to your own – by your own acknowledgment you are pretty tight with the covenants today trey karlovich it’s one of those things like i guess i should say that we are managing it proactively and we – like i said we are in conversations with the bank group kali ramachandran okay thank you operator i am showing no further questions in queue at this time i’d like to turn the call back to mr krimbill for any closing remarks mike krimbill okay well thank you all for your time and we will have better news in the future i hope okay operator ladies and
