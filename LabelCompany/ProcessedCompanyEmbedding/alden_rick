nitasha tiku industry consumer products  services threeyear growth  rick alden started out promoting snowboarding events then he sold bindings  he dismantled his own boots and played with cardoor latches to come up with the prototype next came skullcandy which sells stereo headphones and other audio products the park city utah business hit  million in sales last year  thanks in no small part to the community of boarders surfers and skaters that alden has cultivated through sponsorships and other forms of grassroots marketing as skullcandy goes mainstream he says his goal is to keep that customer base excited about the brand one of our first products was a set of headphones called skullcrushers each set comes with a pair of mylar cone speakers and a pair of subwoofers they were designed to appeal to skateboarders and snowboarders who love a ton of bass the sound rattles your head and bleeds through your eyes its a damageyourhearing kind of bass id walk into snowboarding and skateboarding shops that id sold bindings to or that id known for  years and say hey man i think you ought to sell headphones theyd look at me a little bit funny like gee rick maybe you didnt realize were a skateboard shop we dont sell consumer electronics so id say how many of your customers have ipods music is a lifestyle experience and you are a lifestyle shop  and were selling a product that is relevant to your customer base still convincing them to carry skullcandy took a lot of work we made a lot of guarantees if it doesnt sell well buy it all back well rotate to get the best product mix fortunately weve never had to buy any product back we always wanted to build our technology into other gear  to put audio into snowboard helmets for example so we met with giro one of the top producers of snowboard and ski helmets they loved the idea of putting speakers into their ear pads and wiring not just music but also cell phones they even agreed to print the tag line powered by skullcandy on the packaging after that the company really took off then we would go into shops saying hey we want you to sell our products and they would tell me we dont sell headphones and then id say youve actually been selling skullcandy for a year or two now and point to the giro helmet on the wall i pitched skullcandy to best buy nysebby target nysetgt and circuit city nysecc to be picked up for the fourth quarter of  i didnt anticipate that all three would say yes and place orders for all their us stores could we even build that much product we went to china and figured out a way to increase our tooling cavities so that we could get more units out of a single production run and we delivered on time to all three chains our success in the mainstream market creates a real danger for us our core has expanded from skateboard and snowboard shops to include stores that sell sneakers bikes vinyl records and electric guitars those account for only  percent of our revenue but its the most important  percent and we have to protect it so we sponsor boarders surfers and bmx bikers one hundred percent of our marketing efforts focus on that segment i have a saying conservative guys buy core products but core guys will never buy conservative in other words weve got to be edgy and keep our original consumer happy because without him well lose people like me  old guys who want to buy cool young products too were the guys who sit behind a desk more than we sit on a mountain bike but we want to believe we still belong in that world we all still want to be cool  photograph by ed

javascript functionality is turned off your site experience will be severely impacted we advise you turn javascript back on home our story our story we were born on a chairlift skullcandy came screaming into this world as the brainchild of notorious nonconformer and action sports product mastermind rick alden one day as he was hauling to the top of a park city peak for another powder run he had to yank out his ear buds from his music player and use them to answer his phone that’s when a simple but powerful idea hit him what if there were headphones that could seamlessly switch from music to calls and what if those headphones actually looked as good as they worked that idea on that chairlift on that day was the bedrock skullcandy was built on rick threw himself full force into making his idea a reality just like he did with everything else in his life from skating to snowboarding to art to tinkering in his garage his get it done at all costs attitude attracted a core of likeminded mavericks who didn’t give a damn about playing by the rules or the insurmountable odds stacked against them they were hell bent on turning the headphone game on its head and shaking some sense into a tired industry stuck in its monochromatic ways long story short it worked in a sea of black and white we became a groundswell of color and style that the world had been waiting for skullcandy’s commitment to counterculture and selfexpression scratched the audio itch of core upandcomers and underdogs that nobody else could reach we teamed up with kindred risk takers and pioneers living at full volume like artists athletes djs and helped grow events that were far away from the main stage and mainstream skullcandy’s street cred grew and grew until we boldly secured our rightful place on store shelves and the heads of trendsetters and trailblazers everywhere today skullcandy is a global brand bringing the noise and pushing boundaries far and wide we’ve successfully modernized audio and leveled the playing field by making high fidelity affordable and high style attainable  more importantly we’ve designed our headphones to be used and abused not put on a shelf or in some fancy case they’re made to be your trusty sidekick riding with you through thick and thin as you charge hard at everything you do we’ve firmly planted the skullcandy flag at the intersection of sport music youth culture art film and fashion and are dropping in to become the experts at pushing human potential through the power of music our goal is simple innovate to solve real problems and democratize amazing audio experiences with quality and style for people like you—like all of us we inspire life at full volume our story give back born in pc press releases jobs get the lowdown signup now to get
