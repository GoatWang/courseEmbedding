the best quality product possible every time we don’t use high pressure sales or robots each active power gt is hand built by committed craftsmen we know that you are trusting us with your dream that’s a privilege we don’t abuse active power is owned by chris ardern john wyer  at monterey in  we bring many years of experience in the kit replicar business to the table before chris got into the replica business he was involved in professional road racing and at one point ran one of the original wyer cars in vintage this car is the template for the active power gt the second version of the mark  when the rules in endurance racing banned the big blocks john wyer saw an opportunity for a revised mark  which ended up being the final phase of development on this most amazing piece of racing history chris attributes his fabrication skills to the chance he had to work with some of the big names of the racing industry drivers dennis aase john morton tommy kendall and fabricators doan spencer max balchowski john hotchkis while prepping some of the great cars from the formative years of gt and sports racing after the racing years we gravitated to the custom car business we spent years building nostalgia hot rods learning what people want as not expecting the home builder to have to deal with the difficult areas of the build like fitting the body our most successful package was the body mounted to the powder coated frame with the doors swinging the windows installed these are major labor intensive areas of the build that we take care of for you a big consideration when

  redirected from active power jump to navigation search this article is about power in ac systems for information on utilitysupplied ac power see mains electricity the blinking of nonincandescent city lights is shown in this motionblurred long exposure the ac nature of the mains power is revealed by the dashed appearance of the traces of moving lights power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit in alternating current circuits energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow the portion of power that averaged over a complete cycle of the ac waveform results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as active power sometimes also called real power the portion of power due to stored energy which returns to the source in each cycle is known as reactive power contents  active reactive and apparent power  calculations and equations  power factor  reactive power  capacitive vs inductive loads  reactive power control  unbalanced polyphase systems  real number formulas  multiple frequency systems  see also  references  external links active reactive and apparent poweredit in a simple alternating current ac circuit consisting of a source and a linear load both the current and voltage are sinusoidal if the load is purely resistive the two quantities reverse their polarity at the same time at every instant the product of voltage and current is positive or zero the result being that the direction of energy flow does not reverse in this case only active power is transferred if the load is purely reactive then the voltage and current are  degrees out of phase for two quarters of each cycle the product of voltage and current is positive but for the other two quarters the product is negative indicating that on average exactly as much energy flows into the load as flows back out there is no net energy flow over each half cycle in this case only reactive power flows there is no net transfer of energy to the load however electrical power does flow along the wires and returns by flowing in reverse along the same wires during its travels both from the power source to the reactive load and back to the power source this purely reactive power flow loses energy to the line resistance practical loads have resistance as well as inductance andor capacitance so both active and reactive power will flow to normal loads power engineers analyse the apparent power as being the magnitude of the vector sum of active and reactive power apparent power is the product of the rms values of voltage and current electrical engineers take apparent power into account when designing and operating power systems because although the current associated with reactive power does no work at the load it heats the conductors and wastes energy it still must be supplied by the power source conductors transformers and generators must be sized to carry the total current not just the current that does useful work failure to provide for the supply of sufficient reactive power in electrical grids can lead to lowered voltage levels and under certain operating conditions to the complete collapse of the network or blackout another consequence is that adding the apparent power for two loads will not accurately give the total power unless they have the same phase difference between current and voltage the same power factor conventionally capacitors are treated as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it if a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add this is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission capacitors or inductors are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power consumed by the load purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by  degrees while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by  degrees the result of this is that capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out the power triangle the complex power is the vector sum of active and reactive power the apparent power is the magnitude of the complex power   active power p   reactive power q   complex power s   apparent power s   phase of voltage relative to current φ engineers use the following terms
