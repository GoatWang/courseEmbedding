pharmaceutical company that is developing therapies to treat central nervous system disorders the companys therapies target specific clinical needs for patients living with orphan diseases and other cns disorders who need alternative treatments in order to improve their daily quality of life the company was founded in  and over the last few years has divested itself of a few products in order to focus on clinical development of promising compounds zogenix continues to receive some revenue for manufacturing services and royalties while this stream of revenue is somewhat valuable and the company has some promising earlystage compounds in development the primary driver of value for zogenix for the foreseeable future will be its lead investigational product zx dravet syndrome this drug candidate is for the treatment of dravet syndrome this condition also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy is a rare catastrophic and lifelong form of epilepsy that begins in infancy the condition is characterized by frequent andor prolonged seizures usually beginning in the first year of life developmental delays movement and balance issues speechlanguage delays growth and nutrition issues and chronic infection are just some of the maladies associated with dravet what is worse approximately  percent of dravet patience die due to sudep or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy prolonged seizures seizure related accidents such as drowning and infections this affliction occurs in  out of every  infants born in the united states current treatments are very limited a combination of currently available anticonvulsants is standardofcare but outcomes remain poor and there are no effective longterm treatments with such a debilitating childhood condition and few treatment options it is no wonder that the fda granted orphan drug designation to zx european regulators have also granted this designation zx zogenixs lead investigational product candidate is a lowdose fenfluramine liquid solution for the treatment of dravet syndrome the company owns exclusive license to data and intellectual property on the use of lowdose fenfluramine for the treatment of dravet in january of  zogenix announced it had received a method of treatment patent for the treatment of dravet with zx that covers claims through  in the same press release the company announced that it was pursuing additional patents to protect their lead product candidate in addition zx also received both orphan drug designation in the us and europe and fast track designation in the us clinical trials zogenix is currently conducting phase three studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fenfluramine with multiple data reads due in  in addition the company has garnered very promising results in earlier stage studies the first report released in  highlights results from a longterm openlabel study of fenfluramine in combination with commonly used anticonvulsants this study included  children with dravet syndrome ranging in age from nine months to  years sixtyseven percent of patients were seizure free for one year or longer and  out of  patients had overall seizure reduction of  or greater in a fiveyear followup in   of these children had an average seizure frequency of less than one per month three out of ten patients were seizure free for the entire five year period four out of ten patients were seizure free for at least two years in addition there were no major safety issues and the treatment was welltolerated in december of  at the annual american epilepsy society meeting zogenix presented results from an openlabel observational study in this study nine patients with dravet who were being treated with standardofcare anticonvulsants were given fenfluramine as an addon in doses ranging from  to  mg a day the results were once again impressive during a threemonth baseline the median major seizure per month was  after three months of treatment the average number of seizures among these patients had dropped to just over two per month the study found a  median reduction in monthly seizures over the entire study period which averaged  years in duration there were no major adverse effects and most importantly no evidence of cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension conditions associated with high doses of fenfluramine with promising results from these two earlier studies the company has advanced zx into phase three clinical trials studies  and  are identical trials taking place in north america and the eu and australia respectively patients in both of these trials are administered two different dosing levels of the drug and these results will be compared to placebo these studies will asses the safety and efficacy of this treatment as well as help researchers determine appropriate dosing clinical trial  will evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenfluramine as an addon to patients who have not responded to the standardofcare medication stiripentol zogenix reported that enrollment during the fourth quarter of  accelerated and anticipates this to continue throughout the first quarter of  one of the studies has completed enrollment and the company should have data to report in the second quarter of this year the fdas website indicates that final data collection for  will be completed in june  and data collection for  should be completed this month final data collection for  should be completed in august of  the company indicated that they should be able to announce data from this study in the fourth quarter of  and file for approval in both the us and europe during this same quarter in short there are several major catalysts coming up for zogenix stock over the next ten months based on previous studies i anticipate these data will be positive and zogenixs stock price will appreciate nicely as a result slide courtesy of zogenix inc company guidance financials and competition like most developmental biotech companies zogenix continues to lose money and generate negative cash flows the company indicated that it expects to continue to have losses and negative cash flow for at least the next year more importantly however zogenix has roughly one hundred million dollars in cash its annual burn rate is around  million in its september  quarterly filing the company indicated that it has enough cash to fund operations for the next twelve months but it may need to return to the capital markets for additional funding either through an equity offering which would be dilutive or through a debt offering this possibility may become a reality as the company moves toward commercialization of zx regarding competition zx if approved will meet an unmet medical need current standardofcare for davet anticonvulsant therapies are woefully inadequate no longterm effective treatment exists for dravet the clinical trials using zx to date offer much promise for patients with this awful condition as well as to zogenix shareholders at the same time other companies are developing drugs to treat dravet laboratoires biocodex has received approval and is marketing stiripentol as an adjunctive therapy in the eu canada and japan this treatment is not fda approved but patients can get access to the drug through the fdas personal importation policy with that said this therapy has not proved to be an effective longterm treatment epidiolex a cannabinoid drug being developed by gw pharmaceuticals also has received orphan drug designation by the ema for the treatment of dravet and by the fda for the treatment of dravet and lennoxgastaut syndrome as well as fast track designation by the fda gw has announced positive phase three data also so this therapy may be zxs biggest threat price action valuation and analyst coverage the companys stock price has been volatile to say the least having reached a  week high of  and a low of  as of this writing the stock sits around the middle of that range at  over the last five years the stock has been north of  a share and above  a share as recently as february of  zogenix is a very small company with only a  million market capitalization though the company is not heavily covered by analysts the five that do are bullish on the stock with an average price target of  which would represent an  gain from current levels as always any stock i favor is intended as a longterm investment not as a short term trade opportunity these five analyst project the company will grow earnings at  annually over the next five years conclusion i believe the timing is right for an investment in zogenix the company has several potential catalyst coming up this year and the possibility of a commercial launch in  this is often a good stage at which to invest in developmental biotech companies those with promising drug candidates in latestage clinical trials zx appears to be highly effective in treating a devastating childhood disorder with few treatment options in addition the drug offers potentially substantial commercial opportunities for the company and zogenix has other earlier stage drug candidates the company has also announced positive data for zx for the treatment of lennoxgastaut syndrome zogenix may soon initiate phase three trials for this indication as well i plan to provide an in depth analysis of the lennoxgastaut clinical program in a subsequent article disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in zgnx over the next  hours i wrote this article

and durect corporation nasdaqdrrx  news a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical systems based upon its proprietary drug delivery platform technologies announced today a development and license agreement under the agreement zogenix will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of a proprietary longacting injectable formulation of risperidone using durects sabertm controlledrelease formulation technology in combination with zogenixs dosepror needlefree subcutaneous drug delivery system the companies will also share nonclinical development responsibilities zogenix expects to initiate clinical studies for the new product candidate reldaytm in patients with schizophrenia in early  following filing of an investigational new drug ind application risperidone is one of the most widely prescribed medications used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar i disorder in adults and teenagers  years of age and older relday will be developed to address unmet clinical needs in this large patient population the companies expect that if approved relday will be the first oncemonthly subcutaneous antipsychotic product available in a needlefree delivery system to enter the longacting injectable antipsychotic market the existing longacting injectable risperidone product which achieved global net sales of  billion in  requires twice monthly  ml intramuscular injections with a  gauge or larger needle the companies also expect that if approved relday will provide a new longacting treatment option for patients that currently use daily oral antipsychotic products the combined market for oral and injectable antipsychotic products is estimated at more than  billion in  the companies believe the saber controlledrelease technology will allow relday to be delivered subcutaneously without a needle on a oncemonthly basis with a simplified dosing regimen improved pharmacokinetic profile and significant reduction in injection volume this will be enabled by dosepros unique ability to deliver highly viscous formulations roger l hawley chief executive officer of zogenix said relday is the result of a focused preclinical formulation development effort with durect we believe relday has bestinclass potential because it consists of a proven drug with improved attributes that our market research indicates are preferred by psychiatrists the target audience of us psychiatrists can be covered efficiently with a relatively small sales force outside the united states we expect relday will be of great interest to prospective commercial partners we look forward to working with durect to file an ind for relday which will enable initiation of clinical development in early  james e brown dvm president and chief executive officer of durect corporation said consummation of this collaboration further demonstrates the flexibility and broad potential associated with our saber depot technology platform which we are also employing in our posidurtm program which is in phase iii as well as with proteins and peptides in multiple feasibility projects in conjunction with the dosepro delivery system our goal is to develop a product that meets psychiatrists and patients preference for a longacting subcutaneous needlefree antipsychotic medication zogenix has successfully developed and commercialized a cns product and we are pleased to work with them on this exciting opportunity with relday mr hawley added we view this licensing deal as further validation of the value that our proprietary dosepro delivery system can provide to potential product candidates we have demonstrated that physicians and patients are attracted to the technology with the launch of our first product sumavel dosepro and we continue to focus on identifying new opportunities to more broadly leverage the technology under the terms of the agreement zogenix will make an upfront payment of  million to durect with the potential to pay durect up to an additional  million in future clinical regulatory and commercial milestone payments based upon successful achievement of certain events zogenix will have exclusive global rights to commercialize relday and will pay durect a royalty on relday product sales zogenix will provide additional details on the agreement and the anticipated expenses
