products brand details brand news order online contact review humm kombucha’s seasonal hopped grapefruit posted jul   at  pm last updated jul   at  pm covers products hopped grapefruit humm’s seasonal offering for summer  is this product a  percent juicebased kombucha that blends their kombucha with grapefruit juice along with apple pear grape and orange and hops to create something that’s quite enjoyableusing cascade and citra hops the product has notes of pine and citrus with a slightly bitter finish that will be familiar to anyone that has ever had an ipa while we’ve had other hopped kombuchas humm has executed this product in a way that’s a step above what we’ve had in the past specifically humm’s use of sweet bitter and citrus components works extremely well with the effervescent and slightly fermented tea flavor that’s the base of the product it’s complex but really well balanced and it has a flavor profile that feels more sophisticated than some of the more common kombucha flavors on the market todayvisually we’re big fans of the proprietary  oz glass bottle that humm uses across their line the label has a whimsical background that’s loaded with illustrations it doesn’t give a direct nod to the flavor of the liquid inside the bottle but the copy which contains only five words on the front of the label is easy to read and intuitive to the point where we don’t feel that images of hops or grapefruit are really necessary the concept of a seasonal flavor which is something that’s being used almost universally in the kombucha category is something that seems smart especially in that it allows the company to have something “new” every once in a while that being said a hopped grapefruit offering feels like a good fit as the draw for it probably isn’t going to be as broad as some of their simpler and more common flavors overall humm has done a superb job with this product for a company that’s largely going after conventional retail it’s great to see that they’re willing to create innovative flavors that are a bit outside the box and in the case of hopped grapefruit we think they’ve nailed it on the execution front product

the word “adventure” mean to you does it summon images of deathdefying leaps from mountains or planes perhaps it musters visions of a road trip to places you’ve never been or starting your new dream businessfor some of us “adventure” may bring to mind the idea of learning a new language instrument or skill for others it conjures thoughts of trekking to a foreign land eating exotic foods and meeting new people and for some the word adventure makes you imagine falling crazy in lovein film and literature an adventure typically involves great peril and terrifying scenarios from which the hero must escape who hasn’t pictured themselves as indiana jones racing through the jungle with a massive boulder crashing around his feet our earliest stories were adventures sacred fairytales told around fires about heroes and gods demons and dragonsthen as now the dragons served as metaphors for the great challenges of life the very real fears we all face the myths of each tribe gave purpose to their existence a pride in their people and an example of valor and braverywhat does adventure mean in a modern worldtoday people are far more digital and removed from physical reality which offers less exciting dragons and more common perhaps boring demons like the dmv or the cable companyit is time to seek out your own adventureshere in bend ore we’re fortunate to have ample opportunity to do just that towering snowtopped mountains are the playground of extreme athletes weekend warriors and sleddragging children alike rivers and lakes provide adventures both exciting and serene vast forests offer a glimpse into the world of our ancient forebears for whom each day was an adventure in survival and discoveryjoin the adrenaline junkies equipped with snowboards skis crampons and bikes all the trekkers who thrive here each carving their own course through an adventurous lifewhat does quenching a mad thirst for adventure mean to youadventure as we’ve established is a broad term for each person seeking a personal best velocity there’s another walking on stage for the first time or trying a new fashion accessory to see if they can pull it off but as broad and varied as our adventures may be there are some universal commonalitiesin adventure we expand ourselves and glimpse what we’re made of we put ourselves out there to sink or swim hold up life’s mirror and say sincerely “i tried” we feel present we feel aliveon the humm website we ask our visitors the question “do you thirst for adventure” we’re asking you to undertake a tiny adventure and try what may seem
