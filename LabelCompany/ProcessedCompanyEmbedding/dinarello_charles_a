domainfgffibroblast growth factorsilrailr antagonistpgprostaglandinvegfvascular endothelial growth factorintroductioncytokines can be divided into functional classes for example some cytokines are primarily lymphocyte growth factors others function as proinflammatory or antiinflammatory molecules whereas other cytokines polarize the immune response to antigen during the past  years cytokines have become an important frontier in medicine in a vital place as diagnostic prognostic and therapeutic agents in human disease although cytokines are studied today in nearly every biological discipline cytokinemediated effects dominate the fields of inflammation immunology atherosclerosis and cancer for instance chemokines and their receptors have impacted on inflammation hiv pathogenesis lymphocyte trafficking and autoimmune disease some chronic diseases appear to be driven by “autoinflammatory” pathways whereas others have classic characteristics of “autoimmune” mechanisms mutations in the gene nalp are associated with autoimmune diseases  whereas mutations in nalp are associated with autoinflammatory diseases  although there is clinical overlap in this classification distinct cytokine portfolios have emerged based on the functions of the caspase “inflammasome” the discovery of the mammalian surface tolllike receptors tlr for recognizing a large and heterogeneous number of microbial products is intrinsic to cytokine biology because the intracellular signaling domains of tlr are nearly identical to those of the interleukin receptor ilr both mediating host responses to infection and injurycytokines in evolutioncytokines evolved from the earliest forms as intracellular molecules before the appearance of receptors and signaling cascades cytokinelike activities have been demonstrated in invertebrates such as star fish and drosophilia where they played an essential role in host defense and repair a cytokinemediated rise in body temperature as survival mechanism was demonstrated in poikilothermic lizards  some cytokines function as transcription factors likely their initial functions as well as extracellular ligands for specific receptors evolved later recorded history is full of examples of the devastating effect of infection on societies and one can argue that cytokinemediated events underlie the pathological processes of these epidemicscytokine biology springs from the host production of “pus” long before the microscope exudates containing pus and the presence of fever and local swelling and pain were welldocumented by writers in the ancient world pus was visible and later could be studied in the laboratory the field had its earliest advance with interest in soluble “factors” as they were then called which were studied in the mids as products of white blood cells pus indeed most cytokines are best defined as soluble factors produced by one cell that acts on another cell today however we recognize that cytokines can also function as integral membrane proteins and some are never released from the cell initially cytokines were called “lymphokines” to distinguish them from “monokines” in an attempt to classify these soluble factors by their primary sources but that nomenclature was shortlived and yielded to “cytokines” with the exception of the red blood cell every cell can produce as well as respond to a cytokinethe pioneering dayssoluble factors released from neutrophils from the peritoneal cavity of rabbits were the first to establish a link between a disease in most cases infection and the response of the host fever the biological properties of these soluble factors included fever resistance to viral infections elevated white blood cell count the synthesis of acutephase proteins death of cancer cells and migration of inflammatory cells soluble factors as regulators of lymphocyte functions were not studied until the mids with the first description of “lymphocyte activating factor” by igal gery and byron waksman  and later as t cell growth factor a paradigm developed that a disease process induces the production of these soluble factors cytokines from cells and it is the propertys of these “factors” that accounts for the manifestations of the disease the concept is best appreciated with the nonspecific physiological and immunological upheaval that the host initiates with infection the “innate immune response” is nothing more than a cytokine storm to infection or to cell damage triggered by tlr the hallmark of the innate immune response is its nonspecific nature as the response occurs repeatedly regardless of triggering event the effect of the response on the specific or adaptive immune response is actually collateralthe good and bad of cytokineshere lies the conundrum in cytokine biology particularly for the immunologist the innate response is required for host survival but is also causative in disease for example interferon ifnγ essential for defense against several intracellular microorganisms such as mycobacterium tuberculosis is also a major cytokine in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases the issue of the “good cytokine versus the bad cytokine” has its greatest impact in therapeutic arena il is needed for the generation of cytotoxic t cells ctl and forms the basis for several vaccines but the same cytokine drives graftversushost disease and limits the success of bone marrow transplantationcytokine as hormones of the immune systemfor sure the definition of a cytokine as a soluble factor produced by one cell and acting on another cell in order to bring about a change in the function of the target cell was based on the endocrine system of hormones in a way one can consider cytokines as the “hormones” of immune and inflammatory responses however several properties of cytokines escape this definition for example in lymphoid organs the role of cytokines in the humoral and cellmediated immune response to antigen is mainly local for paracrine and juxtacrine activities in addition hormones are the primary products of a specific tissue or cell whereas cytokines are products of most cells but during a systemic inflammatory response cytokines do exhibit endocrinelike activities such as the synthesis of hepatic acute phase proteins and release of leukocytes from the bone marrow both distant from a site of infection or inflammation on a molar basis cytokines are far more potent than hormones for example the concentration of the cytokine interleukin il that induces gene expression and synthesis of cyclooxygenase cox is  pm and the ability of il to induce ifnγ is  pm in fact because of their potency during purification of some cytokines from cell culture supernatents it was not uncommon to have a biological response in the absence of a visible band on gel electrophoresisthe nomenclature of interleukinsbeing nonstructural proteins biological properties were and still are the gold standards for defining a cytokine the interleukin nomenclature was invented to deal with the issue of multiple biological properties of cytokines at the time of the naming these molecules with an interleukin number primary amino acid sequences of the active molecules were not known the term il was used to define a monocyte product and the term il was used to define a lymphocyte product but the nomenclature did nothing to resolve the broader issue of multiple biological properties ascribed to a single molecule il was reported to cause fever induce acutephase protein synthesis activate b cells and act as a cofactor for t cell proliferation in the presence of antigens or mitogens il was reported to expand t cell proliferation and also activate b cells il was initially termed t cell growth factor and expanded human t cells in vitro t cell growth factor produced in the laboratory of robert gallo at the nih allowed for the isolation of hivthe skeptics are rained inthe concept that a single molecule could possess multiple and diverse biological activities was viewed with considerable skepticism by cell biologists but it was the immunological community that provided increasingly convincing data that indeed this was the case the issue was particularly problematic for those working with il as its properties ranged from effects on control of body temperature to liver protein synthesis to t cell responses to antigens and mitogensdespite highly purified preparations of il and il it was the molecular cloning of the cdna and the expression of recombinant forms of these cytokines that broke the impasse all doubts were pushed aside using recombinant forms of cytokines  a great deal of biology was accomplished using recombinant cytokines and immunological research advanced greatly with receptor identification recombinant cytokines were used not only to confirm the biological properties of the natural molecule derived from cell cultures but more importantly used to discover new properties recombinant cytokines also provided antigens for monoclonal antibody production and the elisa kit the elisa kit liberated the immunologist from the tedium of bioassays and provided for a rapid method for determining the quantity of a cytokinegenes and more genestoday we speak not only of a cytokine as a single gene product but also of cytokine families the family of tnf includes over  members each a separate gene product but with a considerable overlap in biological properties such cell death although there are presently  interleukins the il family has  members and include ilα ilβ il and il although each member of the il family is a separate gene their products overlap in functions as proinflammatory cytokines the family of il includes several members such as il leukemia inhibitory factor il oncostatin ciliary neurotropic factor and cardiotropin each member induces hepatic acutephase proteins in addition to other unrelated biological properties the il family includes il and represents a family of cytokines that inhibit inflammation and immune responses il accomplishes nearly the same functions as does il colonystimulating factors such as il gcsf gmcsf mcsf have overlapping functions but remain distinct gene products with specific receptorsthe most impressive families are the chemokine families in total there are over  individual human genes for chemokines although there are two structural classes the cc chemokines and the cxc chemokines regardless of structure chemokines orchestrate cell migration from the blood compartment into the tissues why this duplication of function such duplication in function is not found in the endocrine system of hormonesduplication of functionthe duplication in cytokine function is best explained from the viewpoint of host defense and immune function challenged with death from microbial invasion the host turns on most cytokine genes there are probably few persons reading this feature who have not cleared a pneumococcal bacteremia without antibiotics in doing so cytokines mobilize several mechanisms for defeating microbial invaders for example cells migrate to the site of infection reactive oxygen species are produced to aid in phagocytemediated killing and procoagulant activities are initiated to walloff the invader and limit spread of the infection at the same time several cytokines assist dendritic cells in the process of antigen microbial presentation which results in the generation of ctl and production of neutralizing antibodiesit is unlikely that evolution could depend on a few cytokines to rescue the host from a lethal infection the large number of cytokines induced during an infection also includes cytokines that aid in repair for example fibroblast growth factors fgf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf should be considered cytokines that participate in the healing process but again we are faced with the duality in cytokine biology as fgf is a pathological molecule in lung and liver fibrosis and vegf is a pathological molecule in cancerdysregulation of cytokine productioncytokines wreak havoc with the immune system turning against itself in autoimmune diseases during infection the cytokine “storm” subsides as the infection is eliminated and the genes return to their normal state of being repressed by histone deacetylases when cytokines genes fail to shut down their products drive the host into a state of chronically activated cells which now dominate an otherwise resting immune system autoreactive t cells are cells that persist and fail to die there are likely other mechanisms of “failure to die” that account for the persistence which are influenced genetically most anticytokine therapies for autoimmune disease target the effects of cytokines on inflammatory and tissue remodeling processes but seem unable to shut down the persistently activated autoreactive t cellgene deletions and gene screenings advance the fieldthe major impact for cytokine studies remains molecular cloning of biologically active molecules the testing of recombinant cytokines and the identification of their specific receptors  the most recent example of this area is the identification of il il is the specific ligand for the orphan receptor st  a great deal about the function of this receptor for the th response and allergic diseases was gained over the past  years without knowing the ligand  with the cloning of il the recombinant cytokine fulfills each of the biological properties attributed to the receptor and closes the circlealthough neutralizing antibodies greatly advanced cytokine studies deleting a specific cytokine gene or receptor in a mouse was also a major advance however in the gene deletion studies the unexpected finding was that most cytokine or cytokine receptor deletions did not affect the mouse unless the mouse was challenged with infection or an immunological challenge the lack of a phenotype in cytokinedeficient mice supports the concept that most cytokines are not needed for health but rather for infections trauma or immunological challenge for example mice deficient in ilα ilβ caspase tnfα or il are fertile and their offspring develop normally and for the most part age normally without a spontaneous disease only when challenged with diseaseinducing events does the deficiency reveal a role for the cytokinein contrast mice deficient in il ilr antagonist ilra or il develop spontaneous diseases the diseases are inflammatory such as inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis in the case of ildeficient mice spontaneous disease develops only as the mice age when they begin to eat excessively become obese diabetic and atherosclerotic  thus il deficiency reveals a property of the cytokine never anticipated as a mediator of th and th responsesanother advance in cytokine biology came as the genomic makeup of a species was sequenced yielding thousands of genes without known function the cdna for human il was deposited in the gene bank  years ago but remained without function until the recombinant cytokine was tested and antiil antibodies used to detect its presence in disease  il is a proinflammatory cytokine inducing tnfα ilβ and several chemokines and is found in tissues from rheumatoid arthritis and crohns disease  one can asked the question how many other genes presently with unknown function are actually cytokines and may have a role in immunological functions or diseasethe failures and benefits of cytokines for treating human diseasewith progress in the late s on the biological activities of “soluble factors” came increasing interest from the pharmaceutical industry in fact the development of the biotech industry can be linked to developments in cytokine biology particularly as cdna and recombinant cytokines validated the field the molecular cloning of the first cytokines in the early s ifnα il il and tnfα coincided in  with the discovery of hiv as the causative agent in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids therapeutic use of il and il held great promise as natural immunostimulant to combat the immune deficiency of aids at the same time it was thought that the immunosuppression of cancer could be reversed by injecting patients with immunostimulating cytokines there was no dearth of animal and in vitro studies to support trials for treating cancer patients or patients with aids with these cytokines at the same time tnfα held promise for treating patients with cancer the fact remains however that injecting humans with il il il il il il or tnfα induces unacceptable systemic inflammation and the use of these cytokines as therapies was abandonedthe only cytokine to receive approval for treating cancer is il but its proinflammatory effects are not easily tolerated by most patients and its efficacy in treating melanoma and renal cell carcinoma is low il was an outstanding candidate for treating a variety of autoimmune diseases as il suppressed ifnγ il tnfα and il production as well as possessing other antiinflammatory activities several trials of recombinant human il showed limited efficacy in psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis and crohns disease but the cytokine has never been approved for therapeutic use on the other hand colonystimulating factors such as gcsf or gmcsf are used to treat bone marrow suppression associated with radiation chemotherapy or transplantation gmcsf has also been used to treat crohns disease erythropoietin is routinely used to large numbers of patients with anemia and bone marrow failure impressively ifnα is administered to millions of patients to treat hepatitis b and c ifnβ for the treatment of multiple sclerosis is also effectiveblocking cytokines in humansthe use of agents that specifically block the activity of a cytokine truly defines the role of that cytokine in disease or in an immunological response although blocking cytokines in animal models with neutralizing strategies established the importance of a cytokine in the pathogenesis or progression of disease approval for use in humans remains the ultimate goalthe first studies of blocking a cytokine in humans was based on reducing il and tnfα activity in animal models of lethal endotoxemia or live infections the animal studies were impressively revealing in that blocking either of these cytokines reduced mortality and therefore it was logical to reduce il and or tnfα in patients with sepsis despite sophisticated intensive care units death from sepsis has an unacceptable mortality rate with over   cases in the usa each year therefore billions of dollars were invested in the development of blocking agents and testing in placebocontrolled trials in over   patients only marginal reductions in allcause  day mortality were achieved insufficient to gain approval a metaanalysis of the clinical trials concluded that like in the animal studies a mortality benefit of blocking il or tnfα was only observed in patients at the highest risk of death blocking il or il for treating asthma was based a wellestablished animal model of airway antigen challenge but the results in several placebocontrolled trials did not show sufficient efficacy blocking chemokines was also thought to be a therapeutic strategy neutralizing antiil failed to affect psoriasisblocking cytokines in autoimmune disease succeedsthe same agents that failed in clinical trials for sepsis were also tested in patients with rheumatoid arthritis crohns disease and plaque psoriasis in the case of blocking tnfα monoclonal antibodies to tnfα or soluble tnf receptors tnfr have been highly successful in these autoimmune diseases and used in over   patients as a result nearly every anticytokine agent whether an orally active inhibitor of a cytokineregulated intracellular pathway a neutralizing antibody or a soluble receptor or a receptor antagonist is tested in patients with rheumatoid arthritis crohns disease or psoriasis blocking il il il or il has been successful blocking il or il has been marginal in general animal models can predict which cytokines are likely to improve rheumatoid arthritis as well as crohns disease  but do not predict which anticytokine is efficacious for one patient but not anotherautoimmune versus autoinflammatory diseaseas the properties of various cytokines were investigated understanding the linkage between inflammation and immune responses expanded for some cytokines the ability to induce inflammatory mediators such a prostaglandins pg nitric oxide or reactive oxygen species impacts greatly on immune responses in chronic diseases autoimmune diseases have both dysfunctional immune responses as well as a prominent inflammatory component for example in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis or crohns disease by blocking tnfα or il activities there is both a reduction in chronic inflammation and a partial restoration of suppressed immune responses other chronic diseases appear to be mostly inflammatory in nature and due to dysregulation of ilβ processing and secretion these diseases are called autoinflammatory to distinguish them from autoimmune diseasesas shown in table  examples of autoinflammatory diseases are familial mediterranean fever neonatal onset multiple system inflammatory disease and systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients with these diseases suffer from chronic fevers systemic inflammation and painful joints however upon blocking ilβ activity there is a rapid reversal of disease severity the pathological abnormality in autoinflammatory diseases appears to be a failure to control the processing and secretion of ilβ in that blood monocytes from patients with these diseases release more active ilβ compared to cells from nondisease subjects the processing and secretion of ilβ is controlled by caspase an intracellular cysteine protease that cleaves the ilβ precursor as well as those of il and il into active cytokines caspase is controlled by the caspsase inflammasome a complex of intracellular proteins the discovery of the inflammasome is one of the hallmarks of cytokine biology

polarization and the generation of t regulatory cellsfundamental to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is the polarization of the immune response and generation of t regulatory cells as controlled by cytokines the th response is dominated by the activities of il and ifnγ in orchestrating expansion of ctl in autoimmune diseases and allograft rejection whereas il and il and possibly il function to promote a th response dominated by antibody production il in the presence of il or il is a th cytokine inducing ifnγ but alone il induces a th response in the case of th a polarization towards autoimmune disease the production of ifnγ is driven by il via the intermediate production of il the differentiation of t into ilproducing t cells plays a greater pathogenic role in models of autoimmune disease compared to th t cells producing ifnγ or il similarly the function of t regulatory cells is also controlled by the cytokine expressed in t cells the ability of t regulatory cells to suppress autoimmune processes and allograft rejection is dependent on the expression of il and tgfβdual function cytokinesmost cytokines function solely by binding to specific cell surface receptors see fig  for examples of cytokines and their receptors which initiates a cascade of intracellular signals affecting gene expression mediated by transcription factors such as nfκb and ap increasingly there are cytokines that function as classic ligands for specific receptors but in addition have another function as transcription factorsfigure  open figuredownload powerpoint slidefour examples of cytokines and their receptors a tnf tnfα is biologically active as a trimer the tnfr is comprised of three chains homotrimer of either the tnfri also known as p  or the tnfr also known as p not shown  and initiates signal transduction the cytoplasmic domains of the tnfr i or ii contain death domains b il il binds to the ilri ligand binding chain with a low affinity  the ilr accessory protein ilracp  is then recruited to form a highaffinity heterodimer the cytoplasmic domains of the ilri and ilracp contain the tollilr domains which are essential for signaling  the cytoplasmic domains of the ilr share a high level of homology with the tlr and signaling is also similar c il il binds to the ilrα chain with a low affinity   the signaling chain ilrβ forms the dimeric complex d il like il and tnf il is a pleiotropic cytokine  il first binds to the soluble s ilr the silr binds to two chains of the gp receptor initiating a signalfor example the nterminal amino acids of the ilα precursor bind to dna and participate in transcriptional machinery  whereas the cterminal domain mature binds to the il cell surface receptor and induces the same portfolio of genes as does ilβ highmobility group b a nuclear dnabinding protein that regulates gene transcription and steroid hormone receptors binds to the rage receptor and functions as a proinflammatory cytokine inducing ilβ and tnfα  antibodies to highmobility group b reduce disease severity in animal models of inflammation il the specific ligand for the il family receptor st is a th cytokine however il is homologous to the nuclear factor high endothelial venules binding chromatin  chromatin binding and transcriptional repression are due to the nterminal domains of il whereas the cterminal part of the molecule is homologous to il ifnγ has intracellular targetssurprises in cytokine biologythe field had its first major surprise when tnf long studied for its effect in killing tumors in vivo and in vitro was shown to be a proinflammatory cytokine sharing many properties with the proinflammatory effects of il such as fever induction of pge and adhesion molecules for many years nearly all investigations on tnf had focused on the eventual administration of the cytokine to treat cancer it was the work of the cerami laboratory that proposed that “cachetin” one of the names used for tnf accounted for several of the pathological changes in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases today using tnf as a cancer therapy remains primarily a laboratory exercise whereas blocking the cytokine has become a therapeutic success and a multibillion dollar businessil studied as a b cell growth factor and agonist in the th paradigm was shown to possess significant antiinflammatory effects the combination of il and il induces ifnγ the classic th cytokine however in the absence of il il induces a th response  not unexpectedly mice deficient in il produce lower amounts of ifnγ and exhibit reduced inflammation compared to wildtype mice but unexpectedly mice deficient in the ilr produce more ifnγ and an accelerated rejection of allografts  another surprise came when mice deficient in il became increasingly obese as they aged and developed frank metabolic syndrome with diabetes insulin resistance and atherosclerosis just by eating more normal mouse food  functional classes of multifunctional cytokineswhat defines a cytokine although the interleukin nomenclature streamlined the dilemma of multiple names describing biological activities into a numbering system the nomenclature provides no indication of the properties of the molecules the interleukin numbers are assigned solely by order of description of the human cdna associated with an activitys once it had become clear that recombinant il and tnfα possessed multiple and often unrelated activities other cytokines were shown to induce varied effects depending on the target cell however most cytokines have one or two prominent properties along with other effects as shown in table  some cytokines act primarily as t lymphocyte or b cell growth factors others function as prominent mediators of inflammation whereas yet others suppress inflammation as well as immune responsestable  functional classes of cytokinesafunctional classprimary propertyother effectsexamplesa does not include soluble cytokine receptors such as stnfrp stnfrp silr type ii il

emigration↑ cell activationil mcp mipα otherssince each cytokine binds to its specific receptor and initiates a cascade on intracellular signals what then explains the multiple and varied properties of a single cytokine in some cases the cytokine receptor is found primarily on one type of cell accounting for its primary function for example il receptor is expressed on mast cells  in other cases the receptor is found on nearly every cell for example il and tnfα in these cases the cell type defines the property of the cytokine for example activation of nfκb by either il or tnfα induces cox resulting in high levels of proinflammatory pge but in cells lacking cox such as t cells il and tnfα act as coactivators of il production indeed another explanation for the pleiotropic nature of cytokines is their ability to induce or to function as coactivators il in the presence of il induces ifnγ but alone induces fas ligand and death of hepatocytes the adipokinesthe adipokines see table  are a recent grouping of cytokines based on their production from white adipose tissue including resident macrophages in fat and their role in the metabolic syndrome particularly in insulin resistance  several adipokines such as ilα and tnfα are already known for their proinflammatory role in the atherosclerotic processes  leptin although initially described as a naturally occurring suppressor of appetite appears to function primarily as a mediator of cytokineinduced inflammation and immune functions  adiponectin is an antiinflammatory adipokine inhibiting macrophage functions resistin increases insulin resistance in muscle and liver tissue but also induces chemokines and vascular adhesion moleculesadipokines have a role in obesityrelated diseases for example in type  diabetes fatty tissuederived cytokines likely account for the progressive loss of the insulinproducing βcells in the pancreatic islets from a historical perspective the ability of ilβ to kill the βcell first reported in   opened the field of cytokines to diabetologists in response to glucose challenge the βcell produces ilβ in a suicidal process  the importance of il in type  diabetes has been demonstrated in a placebocontrolled trial of ilra in which blocking il prevented the loss in βcell function the systemic cytokine versus the microenvironmental cytokinethere is no dearth of reports measuring circulating cytokines and their association with disease severity despite highly statistically significant correlations an important lesson in cytokine biology is that a causative role of a particular cytokine in disease can only be established by specific blockade in animals or humans for example serum il levels often correlate with mortality in patients with septic shock but the administration of high doses of il to humans does not affect blood pressure or the physiological parameters of shock on the other hand ngkg doses of il or tnfα injected into humans induces lifethreatening hypotension  yet there have been few studies that correlate serum levels of il or tnfα with any diseasein the past  years another property of cytokines has emerged – one of being both an extracellular molecule engaging its specific cell surface receptor as well as being an integral membrane protein using a juxtacrine mechanism of cellcell contact for its activity  for example a considerable amount of the biological activity of tnfα in rheumatoid arthritis and crohns disease is likely mediated by membrane tnfα it is likely that many cytokine effects take place in the microenvironment  whereas systemic levels of cytokines such as il levels are primarily markers of disease severityanticytokine genes found in virusesa major advance in cytokine biology and the immune response came with discovery that viral genomes code for molecules highly homologous to mammalian cytokines including soluble cytokine receptors and inhibitors of caspases  viruses use these gene products to prevent the hosts immune response intended to eliminate the infection deletion of these genes from a viral genome dramatically reduces the virulence of the virus and allows an immune attack by the host the best example is viral ilbinding protein which being highly homologous to the mammalian molecule  neutralizes the activity of human il  skin infection with poxviruses such as molluscum contagiosum is remarkable for its near total lack of infiltrating immune cells allowing for a persistent infection the virus actually teaches us of the importance of il in the immune response some viral genes code for biologically active il as part of their attempts to suppress ifnγ during an immune response to the infectionendogenous inhibitors limit the biological impact of cytokineswith the increasing numbers of cytokines being discovered it became clear that some possessed proinflammatory properties whereas others inhibited inflammation the message was that nature had provided mechanisms to limit or balance exuberant cytokine responses for example soluble   and decoy  receptors limit cytokine action of their respective ligands as listed in table  cytokines with antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties are il il il and tgfβ even il appears to reduce inflammation since mice deficient in il have more inflammation than wildtype mates and produce higher levels of tnfα tlr agonists for example induce both pro and antiinflammatory cytokines ildeficient mice develop spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease in the case of the ilra mice deficient in this antagonist spontaneously develop inflammatory arthritis and arteritis  since without ilra there is no counter balance against the effects of ilβanother mechanism for controlling inflammation or during an immune response is the action of “suppressors of cytokine signaling” in the absence of these gene products increased inflammation and immune responses are observed but perhaps the most common mechanism for controlling runaway immune stimulation or inflammation is the effect of pg on cytokine production and cytokine activity pge is perhaps the most potent suppressor of t cell function pgeinduced camp inhibits the production of il ifnγ tnfα and other cytokines a great number of persons routinely use aspirin and other inhibitors of cox or cox which affect cytokine responses particularly immune responses a short course of daily aspirin increases the production of ifnγ from primary human blood t cells  in contrast pge augments the production of il oral cox inhibitors reduce serum il and acutephase proteins in patients with rheumatoid arthritis the discovery that nutritional status and the balance between cell membrane composition of n and n fatty acids affect cytokine production and activity  likely explains a large body of epidemiological evidence on dietary affects on health disease and the aging processan unexpected natural inhibitor of cytokine is alphaantitrypsin aat after albumin the next most abundant plasma protein in humans aat reduces tnfα production and release  increases il levels  and protects the insulinproducing beta cells in the pancreatic islets against immune attack  in a screen of all human plasma proteins aat was the only naturally occurring protein that inhibits hiv  confirming a previous observation that aat prevented hiv replication induced by il ”concluding remarksthis insight into cytokines highlights some of the milestones that provided the basis for the high level of development that cytokine biology has attained today there is probably no other field in immunology since the discovery of antibodies and lymphocytes that progressed so rapidly and with such great impact more than cytokines clearly molecular cloning and recombinant dna aided in advancing cytokine biology but as depicted in figure  it was the biological models in immune and inflammatory processes that provided the milestones the promise of cytokines remains the application of their functions to treat human disease but also to explore their biological effects from embryology to the aging process in figure  one may appreciate how the field expanded from interest in the host response to infection through ligand and receptor discoveries and ending back in the field of infection with the discovery of the pathogen recognition tolllike receptors along the way immunology was transformed and inflammation was tamedfigure  open figuredownload powerpoint slidetime line of milestones in cytokine biology the early work on cytokines focused on soluble factors that were active in in vivo models such as fever in rabbits – colonystimulating factors first reported by leo sachs and donald metcalf ifn and mif  were some of the first cytokines studied in vitro mononuclear cell factor an inducer of pge and collagenases  and catabolin  for breakdown of cartilage were studied focused on the role of soluble factors affecting cartilage in models of rheumatoid arthritis leukocytic endogenous mediator was studed primarily as an inducer of hepatic acutephase proteins   lymphocyte activating factor a macrophage product first described by gery and waksman  was shown to be mediated by leukocytic pyrogen purified from human monocytes   tnf was initially described as a serum factor in animals injected with endotoxin  later the endotoxininduced macrophage product cachetin was purified and shown to be identical to tnf  b cell growth factors bcgf included several factors reviewed in  il was originally described as t cell growth factor  il was the first chemokine   of a very large family the term ilβconverting enzyme was changed to caspase and the caspase family expandedacknowledgementssupported by nih grant ai due to
