efficacy results in fast growing international markets with intense pest and plant disease problems the drivers beind the rapid adoption of biologicals are globally recognized and include evidence of increased yields and crop quality when biologicals are integrated into programs biologicals are also a key driver behind the reduction or elimination of synthetic pesticide residues on crops for export markets delay of pest and plant pathogen resistance to chemicals safety for workers and pollinators and less environmental pollution in south africa grandevo® and venerate® bioinsecticides have generated positive trial results in citrus  a key agricultural market mbi products reduced citrus rust mite populations more than  and offered fruit a comparable level of protection as commonly used chemical products both grandevo and venerate provided effective control of citrus fruit damage caused by false codling moth this pest bores into the citrus fruit making them unmarketable south africa is africa’s largest exporter of agricultural products and exports more than  million metric tons of citrus annually with most fruit being shipped to the eu and asia where limits on chemical residues are strictly enforced south african growers are increasing their use of biologicals to meet the demands for residuefree food from local and international markets and in response to the eu’s ban on controversial neonicotinoid insecticides in latin america field trials with mbi products have demonstrated efficacy in addressing serious key crop problems for example the addition of regalia® biofungicide enhanced existing industry programs for controlling coffee rust venerate bioinsecticide used in integrated pest management ipm programs for managing the dreaded coffee berry borer or “broca” successfully reduced the number of organophosphate insecticide applications including that of the controversial chlorpyrifos by  percent  the program with venerate reduced boring damage by almost  which was  percent more effective than the chemicalonly program  broca can cause coffee farmers to lose up to  percent of a crop and reduce the crop’s marketable price by  to  percent coffee rust causes  billion in damage to coffee plants across latin america and the caribbean majestene® bionematicide reduced the most important pest nematodes of bananas burrowing nematodes as well as or better than the organophosphate chlorpyrifos the burrowing nematode destroys the roots of bananas and plantains so that the plants are starved of water nutrients and lack support causing  yield loss the use of majestene to control nematodes would be a major step forward in reducing exposure risks to pesticide applicators as well in mexico both grandevo and venerate bioinsecticides
