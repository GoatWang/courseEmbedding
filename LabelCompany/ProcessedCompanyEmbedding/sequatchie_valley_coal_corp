mine–sequatchie county tennessee case study as part of a webbased technical and regulatory guidance sequatchie valley coal mine sequatchie county tennessee  site information  contacts western research institute contact jeff morris telephone  email jmorrisuwyoedu  name location and description the sequatchie valley coal mine site is next to the tn site usepa  located approximately  miles northwest of chattanooga latitude n longitude w in sequatchie county tennessee figure  figure  surroundings of the sequatchie valley coal mine source googleearth 9 with a satellite image of april  elaboration itrc the site owned by kennecott energy company is a reclaimed surface bituminous coal mine that was mined between 9s and 99s sequatchie valley coal has reclaimed approximately  acres including  acres of abandoned mine land the owner implemented different technologies from backfilling technology and chemical treatment to anoxic lime drain now the site is covered with natural vegetation however due to rain and runoff the site still produces acid mine drainage amd water continues seeping through backfilled material causing amd problems in lowlying areas where seeps drain into small basins and wetlands amd gets into the natural rivers affecting them and groundwater and soil throughout are also affected in figure  the river path nearest the site is indicated in red the area has many rivers which also transport amd all join into the appalachian basin figure  amd discharge flow from sequatchie valley coal mine source googleearth 9 with a satellite image of april  elaboration itrc  remedial action and technologies western research institute wri has developed a unique biological source treatment technique that is distinctive from treatment techniques which focus on amd effluents the technique uses readily available inexpensive sources of inocula eg wastewater effluent and solids lagoon sediments and substrates eg returned milk other dairy byproducts to raise ph and prevent amd generation at the source microorganisms feed on the substrates and neutralize acidity by consuming acidgenerating protons and producing alkaline bicarbonate as byproducts of their natural metabolism at the same time microorganisms form a biofilm over the amd source material such as pyrite shielding the material from oxygen and preventing oxidation of the pyrite the technology was implemented in a acre area which partially contributes to basins rivers and ponds with an average flow of about – million gallons per year the treatment has been operating for  years and will continue several more years as site is being expanded to adjacent untreated areas  performance to gauge the performance of the technology an electromagnetic survey was used to measure the subsurface conductivity as deep as  m pinpoint sources of amd see figure  and construct a cohesive map of the overall plume without the need to drill monitoring wells the contaminants of concern to probe the performance of the technology were acidity iron and manganese figure  shows the positive results derived from the application of biological source treatment at the site the ph of groundwater downgradient from injection wells has been steadily increasing while remaining in the neutral range figure  cohesive map using electromagnetic survey red indicates a strong presence of amd sources wri  figure  ph behavior as a function of time down and upgradient from treated area wri   coststhe capital and operating and maintenance costs were not estimated because the project is research in progress  regulatory challengesthe implementation of the technology encountered regulatory barriers due to permits needed for subsurface injections and to expand treated area despite that fact there are open lines of communication with state regulatory agencies and the existing data that support the technique are being shared when possible  stakeholder challengesno stakeholder challenges were encountered  other challenges and lessons learnedtreatment is raising ph and decreasing conductivity in treated area adjacent untreated areas were still contributing low ph drainage to surface water sites therefore the treatment zone is being expanded to treat or intercept low ph water from these sites prior to surface discharge  references usepa us environmental protection agency  coal remining
