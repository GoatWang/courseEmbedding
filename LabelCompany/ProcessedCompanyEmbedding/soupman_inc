investing in penny stocks today was alive on july   imagine if you had invested  in apple stock back then or in the top  penny stocks on that date imagine how many new penny stocks have listed since then and how many people who buy penny stocks have made millions since then al yeganah is now a member of that penny stock list simply because that date was a moment in television history for a generation and for al who eventually became famous for his “no soup for you” quote since soupman inc otcbb soupob was the first penny stock to ever have a super bowl ad to promote their truly spectacular culinary selection seinfeld may have made al yeganeh famous by referring to him by a name which he never liked but soup stock investors are about to have one of the hottest penny stocks in the food service industry soup has just launched a new product line and is franchises are about to begin popping up in by one of the best franchisee’s in restaurant history on february   soupman inc parent company of the “original soupman” began trading on the otc bulletin board although they never gave out penny stock advice during any episodes except the one involving kramer newman and “the sponge” the seinfeld finale aired to  million viewers in  four years after al opened his iconic restaurant on eighth avenue and th street few of the worldwide tourists patrons or investors in the pennystock soup know that al hated to be called the soup nazi he is a shareholder in the public company but flies under the radar allowing the higher profiled celebrity investors like reggie jackson “mr october” shaquille “shaq” o’neal “superman” and jason alexander “george costanza” to do the marketing for the best penny stock in the food service industry after going public soupob made sure to keep the original soupman restaurant the exact same as it was when al started it in  and with the exact same rules which are in  languages on the wall for the most effcient and fastest service the line must be kept moving…… • pick the soup you want • have your money ready • move to the extreme left after ordering  on december   soup kitchen was acquired by the newly formed soupman inc soup stock jumped into the spotlight after al was featured in the seinfeld ad running on super bowl sunday  soup stock is mainly supported by the premium soups that are offered under the “original soupman” brand to consumers and the food service industry which soupman manufactures and markets the license soup stock has from al yeganeh the legendary “original soupman” allows the company access to his recipes name likeness and other intellectual properties those same intellectual properties which earned al’s original world famous restaurant a best by “zagat” rating and in  “consumer reports” magazine rated their chicken  vegetable soup the “best chicken soup in america” rated  by zagat and praised by the new york times as “art not soup” set the standard for innovation and excellence long

sell at a fair price that reflects product excellence if you have ever been to the original soupman in new york you will know that regardless of who you are or what the weather is you had better plan to stand in a long line outside and have your order ready soup stock is about to take a major advancement in the respect that with revenues already soupman management are planning to make soupman products leading national brand of premium soup similar to how starbucks took over the market from folgers by focusing on three areas of expansion franchised restaurants dedicated units in casino airports and other highvolume locations and cobranded units similar to soupman’s prototype ny city location with tim horton’s and other partnerships with cold stone creamery and red mango supermarket distribution soupman offers readytoserve frozen products in bpafree packaging soupob recently launched its shelfstable tetra recart package which now allows soupman products to stand sidebyside with canned soup giant campbell’s soupman is undoubtedly poised to both take market share and expand the category al yeganeh the icon who serves as soup stock’s face “soupman” will continue overseeing development of soupman products and eventually make with the “original soupman” brand soupob products the leading national premiumbrand soup the soupman product line consists of over  varieties of the “original soupman” mr yeganeh’s original recipes all are available to soupob franchise owners in bulk and unlike most franchise requirements each soupman franchisee makes their own menu decisions based on their individual market conditions of the current soupman franchise locations the franchisees offer soupman products along with other menu items such as fresh tossed specialty salads wraps toasted gourmet sandwiches fresh brewed herbal teas and desserts which gives soupman franchisees the ability to offer a wider variety of products broader meal experience and higher average amount spent per customer one example of soupman’s successful franchise model in action is their location at the mohegan sun casino in connecticut the restaurant opened in december of  and from a culinary perspective features soupman’s new line of “best of new york” authentic deli sandwiches named after famous ny landmarks such as al’s nd street reuben and the thanksgiving day parade the franchisee of the mohegan sun soupman location is one of the founders of johnny rocket’s hamburgers lloyd sugarman johnny rocket’s in miami was the location of my first date with my wife in  so mr sugarman is responsible for much more than the wealth of restaurant experience he brings to the “original soupman” system as so not to limited themselves to one version of franchising soupman has also cobranded and licensed itself with quality partners such as tim horton’s the largest canadian and fourth largest publiclytraded quick service restaurant chain in north america with  systemwide restaurants including  in canada and  in the us other cobranded franchises included two locations with ranch  a popular new york city grilled chicken chain wendy’s which recently took over the  spot for the quickservice hamburger giants has also done a similar cobranding with tim horton’s which goes to prove that soup stock should soon start to reap rewards for early investors soup stock management  arnold casale – ceo member of the board of directors  as ceo of soupman inc casale oversees the entirety of soupman inc’s daytoday business including production and purchasing operations for our restaurants and our full line of products in supermarket distribution has over  years in the food and restaurant business developed the technology that made it possible to mass produce the classic new

creamery ranch blimpie and taco time was also a member of soup kitchen international’s board of directors from  until  soup stock celebrity shareholders and endorsers  basketball legend shaquille “shaq” o’neal has a number of franchises such as hour fitness franchises and five guys burger and fries along with a handful of others and if you ever had a chance to meet and shake hands with “superman” like i have he has some big ass hands as an investor and pitchman for the original soupman shaq claims the decision was easy “i tasted it one day it’s a good product with a great team my favorite is the lobster bisque it has lobster chunks” baseball hall of famer and yankee legend for his “hot bat” in october post season play reggie jackson joined the board of directors after having eaten the chicken vegetable the lobster bisque and the wedding soup mr october is no investing fool as he has made more money out of baseball than he did while playing having always invested intelligently in appreciating assets whether it was classic cars or buying apple and ge stock jackson has always been known for his investment savvy amongst the baseball playing community which is why his connection to soupman makes the stock seem like a true champion seinfeld costar jason alexander has even gotten involved with the company in a nondisclosed way many people remember when george costanza was thrown out of the soupman’s store in the famous “seinfeld” episode about the soup nazi but few know it happened again in real life when he tried to return to the soupman after shooting the episode for a bowl of soup please note the three celebrities bought into the concept they’re not hired talent all three of them have put their name and money into soup stock for one simple reason “they liked the soup” bottom line soup stock price is not going to going to reflect that of starbucks or campbell’s event though soupman inc products are now available in tetra recart packages for the first time  billion is recorded annually in the main soup aisle where soupman is now able to stand adjacent to their canned competitors soup is an ubiquitous food offering which is why a store with soup as the draw is not a risky business is it profitable look for yourself at the most recent k filed by soupob other than the debt which is the purchase of the original soup kitchen and all the assets of it the company is structurally healthy add soupob as one of those penny stocks you have a look at every now and then to see what’s going on and get yourself online and order the soup if you can’t get to a supermarket that has it or a franchise location to get it served “soupman” style two things i can lay my hat on are is when in new york city you must eat at both the carnegie deli and the “original soupman” and that once you try the soup you will too find yourself logging into your online brokerage account to join mr october superman and costanza as an investor in what could wind
