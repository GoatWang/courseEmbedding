retirement savings leaving investors short of comfortable explore the outlook of  investors in  countries across asia pacific europe latin america and the us as we focus on three key themes perceptions vs reality humans vs machines youth vs experience perception vs realityis fear driving investor behavior nothing ventured nothing gained but finding a healthy risk balance is tricky and personal for each investor our survey found that us investors are still substantially influenced by the shadow of the  financial crisis and revealed concerning trends in how investors perceive and use risk even those who describe themselves as aggressive investors don’t have an asset allocation reflecting that and their cautious investments may hinder their longterm potential for higher returns it is critical for investors to understand the risk profile of their investments here we examine the gap between perception and reality what is the extent of influence of the global financial crisis and subsequent recession on your saving and investment decisions select country global usa uk france spain italy germany belgium switzerland sweden hong kong singapore japan taiwan china brazil mexico

short across generations baby boomers seemed to have had it made enjoying equity and bond bull runs and benefitting from defined benefit pension schemes for gen xers and millennials who are seeking to pay off student loans and own a home retirement saving may be even tougher we discovered that boomers have many goals still unmet for comfortable retirement explore the reasons and remedies for this dilemma and how gen xers and millennials can avoid falling into the same traps thinking specifically about your retirement goals – which have you achieved and which have you yet to achieve not yet

investors haunted by the past nearly rds of us investors say their decisions are still influenced by the global financial crisis of – but the impact is most severe among millennials almost  in  say it strongly impacts their investment decisions given the long shadow of the global financial crisis it is not surprising that millennial investors are more conservative about risk than us investors in general with  describing themselves as either somewhat or very conservative” young ambitious and scared can millennials shed their crisis mentality conventional wisdom holds that younger americans should take advantage of the longer time horizon before retirement to increase their investments in higherrisk asset classes like stocks however us millennials don’t seem to have gotten the memo our
