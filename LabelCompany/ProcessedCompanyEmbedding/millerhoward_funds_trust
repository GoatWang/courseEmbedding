additional information on other programs please speak to your financial advisor risk factors to consider when investing in mlps cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with the mlps operating or business performance mlps typically have a general partner that maintains an aggregate  general partner interest unit holders will have limited voting rights and do not own an interest in vote with or control the general partner the general partner often cannot be removed without its own consent and the general partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of unit holders the mlp may issue additional common units diluting existing unit holders’ interests unit holders may be required to pay taxes on income from the mlp even if they do not receive cash distributions the irs could reclassify the mlp as a taxable entity which could reduce the cash available for distribution to unit holders if at any time the gp owns  or more of the issued and outstanding limited partner interests the gp will have the right to purchase all of the limited partnership interests not held by the gp at a price that may be undesirable mlp tax considerations the tax treatment for investors in mlps is different than that of an investment in stock including a the investors share of the mlps income deductions and expenses are reported on schedule k not form  b because of the possibility of unrelated business taxable income charitable remainder trusts should not invest in this strategy and other nontaxable investors such as erisa and ira accounts should carefully consider whether to invest in this strategy c investors may have to file income tax returns in states in which the mlps do business

incomeequity strategy incomeequity strategy portfolio highlights unfixed income portfolio companies pay and grow dividends providing high current income and increasing income over time by focusing on dividend growth we help clients meet income needs today and in the future dividend growth — a better “analyst” than analysts dividend and dividend increases help confirm past and current financial reports and are one of the best signals from management about current and future prospects for a company diversified compounding machine over time it is compounding income — not style sector or asset classes — that is a main driver of longterm returns investors can reinvest income and dollar cost average earning on both their original investments and also on their earnings portfolio overview incomeequity strategy is a diversified dividendgrowth equity portfolio that seeks high current dividend income plus growth of income and principal stocks are primarily us based multicap companies from across the broad equity market in the portfolio  can be invested in foreign stocks that trade on us exchanges adrs and up to  can be exchangetraded master limited partnerships mlps this strategy has the potential to provide “unfixed income” from stocks with high current yields and growth of cash flow from dividends investors seeking solid total returns that comprise both income and growth high current income that may increase every year potential for inflation protection and a lower federal tax rate on qualified dividends will find this strategy attractive because this version of incomeequity includes mlps it will generate k tax reports investment philosophy consistent with our firm philosophy this portfolio invests in financially strong companies with rising dividends our disciplined investment process focuses on compounding income — not style sector or asset allocation — which is the main driver of longterm returns many studies including our own show that dividendpaying stocks have historically outperformed nondividendpaying stocks and companies that increase their dividends tend to perform the best stock prices may fluctuate but dividends when paid are always positive and unlike bonds with static income equities with growth of income help protect investors from the ravages of inflation even a “tame” inflation rate of  can destroy almost two thirds of an investors purchasing power over  years portfolio objective our investment objective is to provide high current income growth of income and growth of principal as conservatively as possible while investing in the equity markets we seek to add value to our clients’ overall investments by lowering volatility raising the income level and enhancing total return portfolio strategy this portfolio as with all of our strategies is team managed we invest in stocks with solid financial strength investment grade or better and moderately steady growth our holdings have consistent and reliable business models and a history of high and rising dividends that we project will continue to grow we focus on essential services lowcost producers niche companies and companies with outstanding consistency in their earnings and dividends this helps ensure that return expectations are realistic and achievable stocks are sold when a company fails to increase dividends with no reasonable excuse there is deterioration in a companys fundamentals a stock exhibits extended overvaluation there is a negative impact from a regulatory decision or we need to make room for a more

clients such as fidelity cigna usfg delta airlines john templeton george soros federal express and many others in  while investigating alternatives to traditional fixedincome vehicles we conducted a landmark study of the longterm returns of utilities as an asset class our research revealed the incomegenerating wealthbuilding potential of dividends over the long term based on these findings we began managing our first utilities portfolio in  founded on our philosophy that internal compounding high current dividend income plus dividend growth is the key to building longterm wealth we hold to the adage “slow and steady wins the race” founder lowell miller a leading expert on utilities energy and listed infrastructure as well as broad market dividendgrowth companies has been a keynote speaker and member of many industry panels has appeared on louis rukeysers wall treet week and bloomberg tv and is regularly quoted in the national financial media the strong investment team we have built has more than  years of combined investment experience our evolution has been significantly influenced by the results of our utility study and the concept of a repeatingbusiness model in may  we initiated the incomeequity strategy which expands that model to nearly all sectors of the market and emphasizes stable companies that have a high current yield rising dividend and that may contain a hidden “growth kicker” thats not built into the stocks price millerhoward continues to evolve with development of disciplined investment strategies that provide investors with various levels of

why strategic indexes millerhoward strategic indexes is a subsidiary of millerhoward investments inc a boutique asset management firm focused on incomeproducing equities and the entire energy vertical for more than  years our investment focus since inception has been on highquality companies that not only pay a high dividend yield but also have the potential to grow their dividends at abovemarket averages we seek both income and opportunities for growth of principal in a single investment our indexes seek to capture and distill all we have learned over nearly a quarter century of active management of dividend and energy infrastructure companies our strategic rulesbased indexes are created to enhance current passive approaches to asset allocation the indexes are designed to go beyond market exposure by applying persistent strategic factors we have observed and confirmed through our active management they find and retain the good as opposed to capweighted indexes which in our view hold the good the bad and the ugly—by their very nature and definition in addition to their everything but the kitchen sink approach traditional marketcapitalizationweighted indexes tend to overweight overvalued stocks that have appreciated in price millerhoward strategic indexes seeks to improve on this model by equal weighting and by limiting constituent selection to those companies that share distinct positive fundamental factors such as dividend growth yield valuation and profitability—all through a disciplined rulesbased process with regular rebalancing millerhoward pm commentary white

jason van steenwyk value eventdriven closedend funds newsletter providersummarythe millerhoward high income equity fund has a prescheduled liquidation date in  yearsguarantees nav at the end of that year period regardless of discounts in the interimfocus is on dividend income microcaps with a substantial weight in mlpsthe  novel logans run a science fiction book by william f nolan and george clayton johnston envisioned a future in which rapid population growth threatened to overwhelm limited natural resources in order to maintain the balance government officials imposed an age cap for the greater good of civilization all citizens will be terminated upon reaching the age of  which naturally brings us to the world of closedend funds a recent fund offering from millerhoward investments the millerhoward high income equity fund nysehie was just opened last november  and its already a dead man walking millerhoward wont even let this fund reach the ripe old age of  like the citizens in logans run rather this fund has its date with the executioner set for its tenth birthday why kill off a good fund the logic behind setting an expiration date on a closedend fund is this if the fund trades at a chronic discount to nav longterm investors neednt worry once the fund reaches  years of age the whole thing will be liquidated and shareholders will be able to get the full nav for their shares that fact will tend to narrow discounts all by itself if the fund is trading at a discount to nav in the final months before its liquidation it will theoretically attract the interest of arbitragers who will again theoretically bid the price back up toward parity with nav in this regard the fund is similar in concept to a unit investment trust  which also come with a scheduled expiration or liquidation date sure it can be a bumpy ride but investors know they will get nav on november   hie isnt the first closedend fund to have a builtin death date but the concept is still extremely unusual blackrock has used it on a number of funds its also occasionally shown up in bondheavy funds as well such as the western asset investment opportunity trust nyseigi which also has an execution date in late  this term provision directly addresses what many consider the biggest risk of investing in cefs  the risk of holding a fund in a persistent discount explains steve chun director of client services at millerhoward investments if you look at dividend equity cefs you will find that most have traded at a significant discount over the past  years so what looked like good value became a value trap for investors who did not see the discount gap close much during the past years by combining an equity cef with an expiration date and an attractive  yield by the way millerhoward seeks to offer cef investors the best of both worlds  the increased income opportunities that cefs are known for combined with a measure protection from the discount mechanism that is a constant risk for cef investors comparisons with a uit this particular offering from millerhoward has the key advantage of a unit investment trust uit in that there is a scheduled liquidation date which acts as a reality check on whatever market mechanisms may create a discount from nav in closedend funds indeed according to mr chun this particular offering would be equivalent to a year uit but with the benefit of active management the manager dividend growth veteran lowell miller can and doubtlessly will be trying to add value over time by buying and selling promising stocks at press time hie had a closing share price of  closely tracking the nav with a discount of just  although the fund is still quite new it is currently trading at less than  under par a much narrower discount than most closedend equity funds currently trading at an average of  below nav zeroing in on hie the millerhoward high equity income fund is designed as an income equity fund as such the thrust of the return strategy relies on dividends and distributions from the portfolio the fund will invest at least  of total assets in stocks demonstrating high historic earnings quality and substantial yields compared to other alternatives lowell miller is the majority owner with  under his ownership personally and another  under his direction as firm owner you can expect a substantial focus on master limited partnerships mlps which are limited partnerships that are traded over the exchanges this emphasis likely makes the fund highly correlated with the mlpheavy energy industry and helps give the fund a decidedly microcap spin while most mutual fund managers dont care much for mlps lowell miller and his team are old hands in the field having devoted more analyst bandwidth to mlps than most in fact millerhoward actually has a fund devoted to the master limited partnership world the mlp strategy fund which has been in operation since december  millerhoward also operates a soupedup index fund in the mlp space the millerhoward fundamental mlp index unlike most funds in the income category though hie features monthly dividend payouts most alternatives only distribute annually or semiannually a constructive approach to investing in hie would be to see it as a consistent stream of income for the year term generated by a basket of highyield equities the investor needs to consider where they think equities will be trading  years from now  higher or lower than today says chun holdings as of march   millerhoward is reporting holding  holdings with a leverage level of  the largest sector allocation in the portfolio on paper is reits representing  of the portfolio followed by mlps and financial stocks at  and  of the portfolio respectively sector allocations are as follows reits  mlps  financials  energy  industrials  utilities  consumer discretionary  telecom  technology  health care  cash  consumer staples  materials  drill down a little bit however and you will find a few twists in the portfolio first if you combine the energy mlps and the energy stocks in the portfolio its the energy industry that really commands the top slot in the fund portfolio weighting according to miller further they arent holding the same plainvanilla reits that dominate the reit indexes and larger reit funds that is theyre not just holding the same shopping malls and office buildings that everyone else is heis strategy leads them onto paths less traveled by health care facilities and hotel properties yes but also such diverse activities as billboards and server farm housing the funds prospectus states that they could ramp up leverage as high as  depending on market conditions life after death the funds prospectus states that the fund will cease to exist as a cef in november  at that time the fund is scheduled to liquidate however millerhoward has left hope for an afterlife of sorts if it should die in a state of grace with investors that is if it happens to not be trading at a discount to nav the fund could convert to an openend fund by shareholder vote meanwhile while the fund has the same market risk common to any equity fund investors may be reasonably confident of
