schools and is raising his family in this place of suburban homes and apartment buildings on the outskirts of a struggling midwest city and over time he has felt his life to be circumscribed by ferguson’s demographicsmr moore who is black talks of how he has felt the wrath of the police here and in surrounding suburbs for years — roughed up during a minor traffic stop and prevented from entering a park when he was wearing st louis cardinals red advertisement continue reading the main story and last week as he stood at a vigil for an unarmed yearold shot dead by the police — a

young black man at fairground park in st louis in  the death of michael brown  has revived racial tensions in the area credit buel whitest louis postdispatch the origins of the area’s complex social and racial history date to the th century when the city of st louis and st louis county went their separate ways leading to the formation of dozens of smaller communities outside st louis missouri itself has always been a state with roots in both the midwest and the south and racial issues intensified in the th century as st louis became a stopping point for the northern migration of southern blacks seeking factory jobs in detroit and chicagoas africanamericans moved into the city and whites moved out real estate agents and city leaders in a pattern familiar elsewhere in the country conspired to keep blacks out of the suburbs through the use of zoning ordinances and restrictive covenants but by the s some of those barriers had started to fall and whites moved even farther away from the city these days ferguson is like many of the suburbs around st louis innerring towns that accommodated white flight decades ago but that are now largely black and yet they retain a white power structurealthough about twothirds of ferguson residents are black its mayor and five of its six city council members are white only three of the town’s  police officers are blackturnout for local elections in ferguson has been poor the mayor james w knowles iii noted his disappointment with the turnout — about  percent — in the most recent mayoral election during a city council meeting in april patricia bynes a black woman who is the democratic committeewoman for the ferguson area said the lack of black involvement in local government was partly the result of the black population’s being more transient in small municipalities and less attached to themthere is also some frustration among blacks who say town government is not attuned to their concernsaliyah woods  once petitioned ferguson officials for a sign that would warn drivers that a deaf family lived on that block but the sign never came “you get tired” she said “you keep asking you keep asking nothing gets done” video

reasons that spurred several blacks to run for three board positions up for election but only one won a seatthe st louis county police department fired a white lieutenant last year for ordering officers to target blacks in shopping areas that resulted in the department’s enlisting researchers at the university of california los angeles to study whether the department was engaging in racial profilingand in recent years two school districts in north county lost their accreditation one normandy where mr brown graduated this year serves parts of ferguson when parents in the mostly black district sought to allow their children to transfer to schools in mostly white districts they said they felt a backlash with racial undertones frustration with underfunded and underperforming schools

fix their schoolsferguson’s economic shortcomings reflect the struggles of much of the region its median household income of about  is less than the statewide number and its poverty level of  percent outpaces the state’s by seven percentage pointsin ferguson residents say most racial tensions have to do with an overzealous police force“it is the people in a position of authority in our community

in ferguson “what you are witnessing is our little small government has to conform to the change that we are trying to do” mr jenkins added “sometimes things happen for a purpose maybe we can get it

acknowledged some of the problems advertisement continue reading the main story “i’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since i got here” chief jackson said adding that

as imbalanced as in some neighboring departments in st louis county while blacks are  percent more likely to be pulled over compared with their proportion of the population in ferguson that is less than the statewide average of  percent according to richard rosenfeld a professor of criminology at the university of missourist louisin fact mr rosenfeld said ferguson did not fit the profile of a community that would be a spark for civil unrest the town has “pockets of disadvantage” and middle and uppermiddle income families he said ferguson had benefited in the last five to  years from economic growth in the northern part of the county such as the expansion of express scripts the fortune  health care giant“ferguson does not stand out as the type of community where you would expect tensions with the police to boil over into violence and looting” mr rosenfeld said slide show slide show photos in ferguson vigil for michael brown and cleanup after more looting in ferguson vigil for

to get into the pool at fairground park in north st louis after it had been desegregatedin the s a court battle over public school inequality led to a settlement that created a desegregation busing program that exists to this daya ferguson city councilman caused a stir in  when he used racially charged language to criticize teenagers from the neighboring town of kinloch for throwing rocks and bottles at homes in ferguson the councilman carl kersting said “we should call a black a black and not be afraid to face up to these people” according to an article in the st louis

moved with her family to what was then the mostly white town of jennings in st louis county she said some of their white neighbors stuck an afro pick in their front lawn and set it on fire ms herndon

africanamerican studies at st louis university wrote in an email “these concessions may have been enough to prevent st louis from taking what many believed to be the next step toward redress of injustice violent rebellion”but the fatal shooting of mr brown has brought submerged tensions to the surface“st louis never has had its true race moment where they had to confront this” said ms bynes the democratic committeewoman without that moment she added blacks have been complacent when it comes to local politics “i’m hoping that this is what it takes to get the pendulum to swing the other way”ms herndon  said she moved her family to ferguson in  because she felt it was a good community safer than the unincorporated portion of the county where they lived previously and with better schools for her childrenthe town she said offers everything — places to shop eat and drink there is a farmers market on saturdays she frequents a wine bar across from a lot where a band plays on fridays she has white and asian neighbors on either side of her and there are other black families on her block she has not experienced the racial tensions of her childhood in st louis county she said but she understands that the younger generation is living a different experience than she is“i understand the anger because it’s psychological trauma when you see so many people being shot or people being falsely accused” said ms herndon who over the past week has avoided the streets that have been filled with tear gas and rubber bullets in clashes between police and protestersbut now a population of young black men who often feel forgotten actually feel that people are finally listening“if it wasn’t for the looting” said one man who declined to give his name “we wouldn’t get the attention”mr moore went one step further he does not condone the violence that erupted during some of the protests he said but he does understand the frustration and if he were younger he said he

of strahan getting special treatment michael strahan you’ve never lived until you hit tom brady michael strahan compares fashion to football don’t expect to see michael strahan’s handsome face on any more commercials as part of his deal to join “good morning america” fulltime strahan — who’s hawked brands from pizza hut to metamucil — will have to drop his endorsement deals page six has learned the move to dump his advertising efforts is being made because when strahan jumped from abc’s “live with kelly and michael” to “gma” he effectively became an employee under the abc news division which forbids staffers from endorsements on his former disneyabc domestic television show with kelly ripa strahan wasn’t subject to the same rules ripa does ads for brands including colgate toothpaste and electrolux appliances the hunky former giants player has been a oneman branding machine previously starring in commercials for products from subway pizza hut metamucil snickers dr pepper and right guard among others but an abc rep said strahan’s endorsement deals will end “in the next few months” and will not be renewed however he will be able to continue working on a line of suits designed with jc penney that he launched in  in may the chain said strahan would create a new “activewear line” msx an abc spokesperson told us of the move “michael’s endorsements are set to expire in the next few months and won’t be renewed his clothing line with jc penney will continue and he’s held to the same disclosure standard as anyone else at abc news” the rep added “if there is a story we’re reporting that involves a conflict of interest or a perception of conflict michael won’t cover it or it will be disclosed onair” either way busy strahan can make up any cash loss with a new gig hosting relaunched game show “the  pyramid” current giants star victor cruz recently said of strahan at cannes lions “michael strahan is the template for everything now and the deals and opportunities
