whether actual results and developments will agree with our expectations and predictions is subject to many risks and uncertainties accordingly there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations and predictions we believe these factors include but are not limited to the following · we have a limited operating history with significant losses and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future · there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses from operations an accumulated deficit and insufficient cash resources on hand to meet our business objectives all of which means that we may not be able to continue operations · we could face intense competition which could result in lower revenues and higher expenditures and could adversely affect our results of operations · we are governed by only three persons serving as directors and officers which may lead to faulty corporate governance   · we must attract and maintain key personnel or our business may fail   · we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs due to changes in general economic conditions · our business and operating results could be harmed if we fail to manage our growth or change · we have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in growing our business then we may have to scale back or even cease our ongoing business operations  · if our intellectual property is not adequately protected then we may not be able to compete effectively and we may not be profitable · if we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim the cost of participating in any litigation could impact our ability to stay in business · we could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any of our food and nutritional products and intellectual property rights against infringement and any related litigation could be timeconsuming and costly · if we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources may be strained · if we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources may be strained · our services may become obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to respond adequately to rapidly changing technology and customer demands · our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm product sales and harm our financial condition and operating results · if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to adequately meet the changing needs of our customers some of our products could fail in the marketplace which could negatively impact our revenues financial condition and operating results · we are affected by laws and governmental regulations with potential penalties or claims which could harm our financial condition and operating results · since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and supply of certain of our products if these third parties fail to reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality and which are manufactured in compliance with applicable laws then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed · we may incur material product liability claims which could increase our costs and harm our financial condition and operating results · unless we can generate sufficient cash from operations or raise additional funds we may not be able to meet our debt obligations · our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us · if we do not manage our supply chain effectively our operating results may be adversely affected · our stock price may be volatile which may result in losses to our shareholders · our common shares are thinly traded and our shareholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all · the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small and developing company which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price our shareholders may be unable to sell your common stock at or above their purchase price if at all which may result in substantial losses  · we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders   and as a result shareholders may only realize a return when the shares are sold · we are listed on the otcqb quotation system and our common stock is subject to “penny stock” rules which could negatively impact our liquidity and our shareholders’ ability to sell their shares · volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation · the elimination of monetary liability against our directors officers and employees under nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors officers and employees and · our business is subject to

mobile menu our story a sea change in the fishing industry here at trident catching fish isnt just our business its our livelihood its our calling we are all fishermen here and catching the purest and healthiest seafood is what we do — its what weve done for more than  years and if we stay true to our beliefs in protecting the oceans where we fish its what well be doing  years from now too the journey north family of fishermen the trident advantage culture of innovation the journey north   the story of trident seafoods starts back in  when a yearold kid with nothing but a dream drove an old ford from tennessee to seattle in search of a great adventure at sea that yearold kid was chuck bundrant and that little “adventure” stretched into a year journey across alaska aboard any ship he could find discovering everything there is to know about fishing and crabbing along the way chuck met two other likeminded crab fishermen in the early s kaare ness and mike jacobson all three pooled their money together and built the billikin—a foot boat that not only changed the course of their partnership but also changed the course of the entire seafood industry the ingenious billikin was the first vessel of its kind to feature crab cookers and freezing equipment onboard so their fresh catch could be processed as soon as it was pulled out of the water instead of coming all the way back to shore in the winter of  chuck bundrant drove his old ’ ford from tennessee to seattle but not before snapping a quick shot with his father soon after the pioneering partnership expanded once more when the three fishermen joined with edd perry and his bellinghambased company san juan seafoods now they had all the resources they needed to match their ambitions that partnership over  years ago marked the beginning of trident seafoods and that yearold kid from tennessee would become its founder and ceo chuck bundrant could never have imagined how far that little “adventure” back in ‘ was going to take him chuck in the wheelhouse of his very first fishing vessel the addington chuck and his crew of the tugidak are all smiles as they pose with the biggest king crab they’ve ever seen it took a lot of hard work and determination to make trident what it is today and chuck was never afraid to get his feet wet or his hands dirty a young chuck bundrant discovering just how cold it can get onboard an alaskan fishing boat in winter previous next today that dream is still alive and stronger than ever trident seafoods has become the largest verticallyintegrated seafood company in north america since its founding yet we still hold true to the same beliefs we held four decades ago now more than ever we believe that fish is our future because it’s the healthiest protein we can put in our bodies and we believe that this gift from the oceans is one we can never take for granted we treat the sea with the respect it deserves working toward sustaining a thriving and abundant ocean for generations to come because we are fishermen at our core and we have a bond with the ocean—when it prospers we prosper too chuck has every reason to smile that little company he started over  years ago is now the largest verticallyintegrated seafood company in north america ↑  back to top   the journey north family of fishermen the trident advantage culture of innovation family of fishermen   many other seafood companies buy the fish they sell to you we don’t we catch our own    we know our seafood is the purest freshest and besttasting seafood you will ever buy because we catch it ourselves we have our own fleet of stateoftheart fishing vessels where our fish are caught prepared and frozen right onboard and we partner with only the most experienced fishermen—fishermen who love what they do for a living who have been with us for decades and who respect the oceans as much as we do  measuring  feet long with a crew of five the steel fishing vessel gladiator has been catching wild pollock in the alaskan waters for  years we partner with thousands of independent and dedicated alaskan fishermen—like the morovic family they’re a small familyrun business who have been catching wild salmon for us on their salmonseining ship miss danica for years all the fishermen in our extended family love what they do for a living or they wouldn’t be working with trident if they didn’t the morovic family is one of the many independent familyrun businesses that catch wild alaskan salmon for trident meet our captains in addition to partnering with independent fishermen trident also has its own fleet of fishing vessels that are skippered by only the most experienced captains  captain ed french is skipper of the gladiator and he’s proudly been fishing for trident for  years now captain howard malcolm has been a fisherman for  years with  of those years working for trident onboard the northern patriot captain craig jenssen is skipper of the foot steel catchervessel dominator he’s been fishing for trident for  years captain rick clark is skipper of the fishing vessel columbia he’s got  years of experience at sea with the last  of those years working for trident previous next and not only is trident a family of fishermen but we are also a familyowned business we don’t answer to investment bankers like some other seafood companies we only answer to our customers our fishermen and our employees chuck bundrant founded trident seafoods on family principles some  years ago and now his son joe captains the ship as ceo chuck and his son joe onboard the bountiful in  and today we’re proud to be familyowned and operated with joe now serving as trident’s ceo ↑  back to top   the journey north family of fishermen the trident advantage culture of innovation the trident advantage   we’ve made our life from the sea for over  years now and no one knows how to do it better than trident we’ve spent so much time catching fish that saltwater runs in our blood our sweat and our tears and we’ve learned quite a few things along the way… we know we sell the best seafood available today because we control every part of the process every step of the way—from the second it leaves the icy alaskan waters to the moment you prepare it this fierce bald eagle keeps a close eye on the crew at our plant in akutan alaska he knows good seafood when he sees it how can we be so sure we already told you about our stateoftheart fishing vessels where each and every fish is caught prepared and frozen right onboard within minutes of capture but we’ve also developed innovative processing plants along alaska’s shores in the heart of the fishing grounds strategically located to ensure the freshest fish possible in facilities across the lower  states we take alaska’s bounty and provide you with convenient easytolove seafood entrees and valueadded products explore our fleet our processing plants the viking explorer is one of  trident trawl catchervessels operating in the bering sea

sustainability is an investment in our future it’s a way to ensure this resource is still around for our kids and their kids it’s why we invest in and support the local communities where we fish sustainable responsible fishing is one of our core beliefs and it’s also one of the many reasons we love fishing in the beautiful alaskan waters—they’ve actually written into their state constitution that all fisheries must follow the strictest of sustainability guidelines responsibility our bond with the ocean runs deep we proudly participate in some of the most sustainable fisheries in the world fish it’s our future fish leave a lighter environmental footprint on our planet than pork poultry dairy and beef fish is better for our bodies our minds and the environment than any other source of protein out there fish is the way to nourish ourselves and keep us healthy without neglecting the earth in the process it’s what  years of fishing experience has taught us and by partnering with organizations who share our vision—like the seafood nutrition partnership the genuine alaska pollock producers the alaska seafood marketing institute and the national fisheries institute—we can ensure a responsible stewardship of alaskan seafood for generations to come  compared to landbased proteins like cattle and poultry wildcaught alaska pollock leaves a much lower carbon footprint on our planet ↑  back to top   the journey north family of fishermen the trident advantage culture of innovation culture of innovation   starting back in  we were the first company to catch process and
