forgetfulness confusion and even physical  mental challenges our innovative medpod is a patientcentered customized communication hub that revolutionizes the way patients experience the pharmacy process and interaction with their medication regimen and caregivers the medpod is designed especially for patients with chronic or acute conditions and for organizations deploying valuebased population health solutions the medpod is powered by samsung’s realtime cloud and hardware technology to empower and ensure medication adherence and secure communication while raising clinical therapeutic outcomes and managing healthcare premiums hospitals in  hospital readmissions due to the patient’s relapse cost the government more than  billion under new health reform laws hospitals now bear the staggering cost of these relapse readmissions and may be penalized for quality metrics the primary cause for hospital readmissions is identified as a breakdown in continuity of care upon discharge from the hospital the sudden change of setting and lack of a single entity to oversee a patient’s compliance with their therapeutic regimen can lead to confusion human error as well as the impact of negative social factors this leads to lower compliance that can increase risk of relapse and expense to the hospital the medpod’s capacity to ensure continuity of care and realtime disease management translates to lower hospital readmission rates due to relapse this equates to a higher quality of care and lower hospital related costs additionally the medpod provides realtime analytics to the hospital providing data as to whether the readmission was due to nonadherence or poor patient care the medpod dispenses presorted prescribed medication pouches customized to each patient’s drug

patient’s compliance and biometrics physicians can utilize an eventbased system to efficiently respond promptly to patient needs as payforoutcome models become more attractive for physicians low compliance not only means poor therapeutic outcome but also reduced profit poor communication and an inability to respond promptly when patient compliance falters or continuity of care is not maintained are challenges for physicians striving to provide quality care and for atrisk physician groups who are financially responsible for poor therapeutic outcomes the challenge is even greater poor therapeutic outcomes mean increased expenditures insuranceproviders  of the healthy insured population support  of the insured members who are most chronically ill these chronic illnesses primarily diabetes high cholesterol and high blood pressure are preventable and treatable however when patient compliance goes down disease incidents increase inflating insurance premiums even for those without illness the medpod’s ability to improve a patient’s compliance of their therapeutic regimen as well as inform insurance companies about the patient’s compliance status not only improves that patient’s health but lowers healthcare costs for everyone insurance companies now have the ability to base incentives on a patient’s compliance with their treatment regimen while implementing a valuebased insurance design payors are able to provide to patients a medpod powered realtime content management system for delivery of interactive wellness programs through the medpod’s communication and content management platform the data collected by the medpod hub empowers predictive modeling for payors enabling roi by rapidly targeting resources on patient populations that require the most help which in the end reduces the cost for all pharmaceuticalcompanies with insurance companies evaluating medicine and treatments based on comparative effectiveness pharmaceutical companies are concerned with accurate assessments of their products’ efficacy low compliance rates negatively affect these assessments and may prompt insurance carriers to add a competitive company’s medication to their formulary by increasing patient compliance rates the medpod leads to improved and more accurate assessments of a medication’s efficacy this information is vital to pharmaceutical manufacturers who can now use realtime clinical metrics to demonstrate their product’s comparative effectiveness the medpod also provides a communication and content management platform for pharmaceutical companies that can be customized to specific disease states and medication to further elevate therapeutic outcomes the platform includes a customized medpod online portal and app government governments across the globe are the worlds biggest payors single payor systems and medicaremedicaid are constantly seeking new tools and services to deploy for their population health programs the medpod achieves the triple aim by improving the patient experience lowering costs and raising clinical outcomes regulatory and consumer protection agencies have programs in place to monitor the safety of drugs available to the public either over the counter or by prescription by accessing payor database records these agencies can see which medicines where prescribed and in what doseshowever they lack the ability to track patient compliance crucial information for constructing an accurate realtime data metric of the potential threat of tainted or noneffective medications the medpod’s critically focused advantage of realtime compliance and prescription drug usage data metric enables governmental regulatory agencies to promptly manage these issues during crises situations traditionally households were known to extend beyond the nuclear family however contemporary family structures are now far more relationally and geographically spread out with grown children living in other states and even other countries the lack of available family support also contributes to low medication and disease management adherence rates even with family members who live in the same town busy daily schedules and responsibilities prevent caregivers and family members from accompanying the patient to every appointment or supervising their treatment regimen regardless of distance family members can provide support for loved ones using the medpod accessing their loved one’s records via the medpod portal family members can review compliance status they can also receive texts emails or phone and video calls about nonadherence within the prescribed treatment regimen if needed they make a call to their family member to check in support from family members can improve compliance rates which leads to improved therapeutic outcomes identity theft is a critical concern particularly among the elderly once a social security number is stolen it can be used to obtain medicine the cost of which is then charged to medicare without the ability to track the medication this  billion dollar a year crime will continue the medpod’s ability to track drug regimens translates to patient peaceofmind against identity theft and defense against costly medicare fraud employers employers are constantly striving for new programs to engage their employees and retirees in wellness programs to keep them motivated

for constructing an accurate realtime data metric of the potential threat of tainted or noneffective medications  the medpod’s critically focused advantage of realtime compliance and prescription drug usage data metric enables governmental regulatory agencies to promptly manage these issues during crises situations traditionally households were known to extend beyond the nuclear family  however contemporary family structures are now far more relationally and geographically spread out with grown children living in other states and even other countries the lack of available family support also contributes to low medication and disease management adherence rates even with family members who live in the same town busy daily schedules and responsibilities prevent caregivers and family members from accompanying the patient to every appointment or supervising their treatment regimen regardless of distance family members can provide support for loved ones using the medpod accessing their loved one’s records via the medpod portal family members can review compliance status they can also receive texts emails or phone and video calls about nonadherence within the prescribed treatment regimen  if needed they make a call to their family member to check in support from family members can improve compliance rates which leads to improved therapeutic outcomes identity theft is a
