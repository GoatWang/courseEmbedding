under the semiannual distribution plan was  per annum on october   and  under the monthly distribution plan estimated longterm return to unit holders under the semi annual distribution plan was  per annum on october   and  under the monthly distribution plan estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of all of the bonds in the trust and  takes into account a compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each unit of the trust since the market values and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of the trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated current return and estimated longterm return indicated above will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of the estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price the above figures

achieved an investment in the fund should be made with an understanding of the risks which an investment in fixed rate longterm debt obligations may entail including the risk that the value of the units will decline with increases in interest rates neither the public offering price of the units of an insured trust nor any evaluation of such units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by such trust unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default see public offeringhow is the public offering price determined on the other hand the value of insurance page  obtained by the bond issuer the sponsor or others is reflected and included in the market value of such bonds insurance obtained by an insured trust or by the bond issuer the sponsor or others is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security therefor if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancelable policy for the scheduled payment of interest and principal on the bonds is issued by the insurer a single premium is paid by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others for preinsured bonds and a monthly premium is paid by each insured trust for the insurance obtained by such trust except for bonds in such trust which are insured by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others in which case no premiums for insurance are paid by such trust upon the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained by an insured trust the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity with respect to such bond upon the payment of a single predetermined

service inc have rated the claimspaying ability of financial guaranty and ambac indemnity aaa and aaa respectively see why and how are the insured trusts insured in selecting bonds the following facts among others were considered i the standard  poors rating or fitch investors service incs rating of the bonds was in no case less than bbb in the case of an insured trust or an arkansas kansas or maine advantage trust and a in the case of other advantage trusts or the moodys investors service inc rating of the bonds was in no case less than baa in the case of an insured trust or an arkansas kansas or maine advantage trust and a in the case of other advantage trusts including provisional or conditional ratings respectively or if not rated the bonds had in the opinion of the sponsor credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interestbearing taxexempt obligations that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the fund see description of bond ratings ii the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity iii with respect to the insured trusts the availability and cost of insurance of the principal and interest on the bonds and iv the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer subsequent to the initial date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the initial date of deposit neither event requires elimination of such bond from the portfolio but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see rights of unit holders how may bonds be removed from the fund the portfolio appearing in part one contains bond ratings when available for the bonds listed at the date shown certain of the bonds in the trusts may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the market discount of previously issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall other things being equal a discount bond held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see what is the federal tax status of unit holders appearing in part three for each trust certain of the bonds in the trusts may be original issue discount bonds under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxexempt interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income see what is the federal tax status of unit holders appearing in part three for each trust the current value of an original discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity the market value tends to increase in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity certain of the original issue discount bonds may be zero coupon bonds including bonds known as multiplier bonds money multiplier bonds page  capital appreciation bonds capital accumulator bonds compound interest bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or redeemed zero coupon bond features include  not paying interest on a semiannual basis and  providing for the reinvestment of the bonds semiannual earnings at the bonds stated yield to maturity while zero coupon bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate of return minimizes reinvestment risk this benefit can be negated in large part by weak call protection certain of the bonds in the trusts may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trusts were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemptions are more likely to occur at times when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value to the extent that the bonds were deposited in the fund at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the original public offering price of the units because premium bonds generally pay a higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par the effect of the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce estimated net annual unit income by a greater percentage than the par amount of such bonds bears to the total par amount of bonds in the trust although the actual impact of any such redemptions that may occur will depend upon the specific bonds that are redeemed it can be anticipated that the estimated net annual unit income will be significantly reduced after the dates on which such bonds are eligible for redemption the trust may be required to sell zero coupon bonds prior to maturity at their current market price which is likely to be less than their par value in order to pay expenses of the trust or in case the trust is terminated see rights of unit holdershow may bonds be removed from the fund and other informationhow may the indenture be amended or terminated certain of the bonds in the trusts may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in the fund both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds in the trusts may be healthcare revenue bonds healthcare revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from services provided by hospitals or other healthcare facilities including nursing homes a healthcare issuers ability to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels of the facility demand government regulations wages of employees overhead expenses competition from other similar providers malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental competition from other similar providers malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental financial assistance including medicare and medicaid and other similar third party payer programs certain of the bonds in the trusts may be housing revenue bonds housing revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing projects for low to moderate income families housing revenue bonds are generally payable at any time and therefore their average life will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels rental income mortgage default rates taxes operating expenses governmental regulations and the appropriation of subsidies page  certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees problems faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric energy utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which among other things establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission the difficulty in financing large construction programs increased federal state and municipal

for electricity in certain areas of the country the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation certain of the bonds in the trusts may be lease obligations issued primarily by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues rather the governmental authorities are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings ie schools administrative offices convention centers and prisons or the purchase of equipment ie police cars and computer systems that will be used by a state or local government the lessee these obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service on the obligations lease obligations are subject in almost all cases to annual appropriation risk ie the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year or construction and abatement riskrental obligations cease in the event that delays in building damage destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee certain of the bonds in the trusts may be industrial revenue bonds irbs taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects debt service payments on irbs are dependent on various factors including the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project and regulatory and environmental restrictions certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the ability of issuers to make debt service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations under these use agreements similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes general problems relating to college and university obligations would include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and new government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to page  process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities certain trusts may contain bonds of issuers located in the commonwealth of puerto rico or issuers which will be affected by general economic conditions of puerto rico puerto ricos unemployment rate remains significantly higher than the us unemployment rate furthermore the economy is largely dependent for its development upon us policies and programs that are being reviewed and may be eliminated the puerto rican economy consists principally of manufacturing pharmaceuticals scientific instruments computers microprocessors medical products textiles and petrochemicals agriculture largely sugar and tourism most of the islands manufacturing output is shipped to the mainland united states which is also the chief source of semi finished manufactured articles on which further manufacturing operations are performed in puerto rico since world war ii the economic importance of agriculture for puerto rico particularly in the dominance of sugar production has declined nevertheless the commonwealthcontrolled sugar monopoly remains an important economic factor and is largely dependent upon federal maintenance of sugar prices the discontinuation of which could severely affect puerto rico sugar production the level of tourism is affected by various factors including the strength of the us dollar during periods when the dollar is strong tourism in foreign countries becomes relatively more attractive the puerto rican economy is affected by a number of commonwealth and federal investment incentive programs for example section  of the internal revenue code provides for a credit against federal income taxes for us companies operating on the island if certain requirements are met the omnibus budget reconciliation act of  imposes limits on such credit effective for tax years beginning after  in addition from time to time proposals are introduced in congress which if enacted into law would eliminate some or all of the benefits of section  although no assessment can be made at this time of the precise effect of such limitation it is expected that the limitation of section  credits would have a negative impact on puerto ricos economy the foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers of bonds and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of the bonds are subject additionally many factors including national economic social and environmental policies and conditions which are not within the control of the issuers of bonds could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of puerto rico and various agencies and political subdivisions located in puerto rico the sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of bonds the market value or marketability of the bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the bonds acquired by the trusts to pay interest on or principal of the bonds interest on certain of the bonds in certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts will be an item of tax preference for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt the investment by nonamt individual taxpayers in amt municipal bonds generally results in a higher yield to such bondholders than nonamt municipal bonds since a portion of the interest from certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts is an amt preference item certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts may be more appropriate for investors who are not subject to amt investors should be aware that many of the bonds in the trusts are subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use of bond proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from bond proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal income taxation although at the time of issuance of each of the bonds in the trusts an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on such obligations from federal income taxation there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements page  established upon issuance of the bonds a failure to comply with such requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations is subject to federal income taxation perhaps even retroactively from the date of issuance of such bonds thereby reducing the value of the bonds and subjecting unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities because certain of the bonds may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unit holders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any bond certain of the bonds contained in the trusts may be subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to optional redemption provisions sinking fund provisions special or extraordinary redemption provisions or otherwise a bond subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from time to time at par or in the case of a zero coupon bond at the accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue prior to maturity special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par or for original issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus if applicable some premium of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain circumstances the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the longterm return and the current return on units of each trust redemption pursuant to call provisions is more likely to occur and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value unit holders may recognize capital gain or loss upon any redemption or call to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date hereof in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the trusts at any time after the date hereof litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under recentlyenacted environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted the fund has received opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authority of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income taxes and state and local taxes in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds what are estimated longterm return and estimated current return at the date of this prospectus the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return under the monthly quarterly if applicable and semiannual if applicable distribution plans are as set forth in part one attached hereto for each trust estimated current return is computed by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price any change in either amount will result in a change in the estimated current return for each trust the public offering price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying bonds and the net annual interest income per unit will change as bonds are redeemed paid sold or exchanged in certain refundings or as the expenses of each trust change therefore there is no assurance that the estimated current return indicated in part one for page  each trust will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of all of the bonds in the trust and  takes into account a compounding factor the expenses and sales charge associated with each unit of a trust since the market values and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of the trust will change there is no assurance that the estimated longterm return indicated in part one for each trust will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price neither rate reflects the true return to unit holders which is lower because neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions to unit holders a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns and estimated longterm returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on the trust and returns over specified periods on other similar trusts sponsored by nike securities lp with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust how are purchased interest and accrued interest treated purchased interest for the first trust combined series  each trust contains an amount of purchased interest purchased interest is a portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the bonds from the later of the last payment date on the bonds or the date of issuance thereof through the first settlement date and is included in the calculation of the public offering price purchased interest will be distributed to unit holders as units are redeemed or securities are sold mature or are called see summary of essential information appearing in part one for each trust for the amount of purchased interest per unit for each trust purchased interest is an element of the determination of the price unit holders will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of units prior to the termination of the trust accrued interest accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on bonds generally is paid semiannually although each trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling subsequent to the first settlement date the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement unit holders will receive on the next distribution date of the trust the amount if any of accrued interest paid on their units for the first trust combined series  except through an advancement of its own funds the trustee has no cash for distribution to unit holders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a trust the trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other costs to such trust from interest received on the bonds in the trust when these advancements have been recovered regular distributions of interest to unit holders will commence see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed interest account balances are established with generally positive cash balances so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with interest distributions for the first trust combined series  in an effort to reduce the amount of purchased interest which would otherwise have to be paid by unit holders the trustee may advance a portion of the accrued interest to the sponsor as the unit holder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement other than the purchased interest already included therein less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed for the first trust combined series  and subsequent series in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to the public the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the unit holder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed page  because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unit holders if a unit holder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the purchased interest if any and accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds including purchased interest if any held in the interest account for distributions to unit holders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unit holders the trustee benefits thereby why and how are the insured trusts insured the following discussion is applicable only to the insured trusts the bonds in the portfolio of an advantage trust are not insured by insurance obtained by the fund all bonds in the portfolio of an insured trust are insured as to the scheduled payment of interest and principal by policies obtained by each insured trust from financial guaranty insurance company financial guaranty or fgic a new york stock insurance company or

such trust so long as such trust is in existence and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by such trust see portfolio for each insured trust nonpayment of premiums on the policy obtained by each insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will permit financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by each insured trust are fixed for the life of such trust the premium for any preinsured bonds has been paid in advance by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the insurer andor insurers thereof remain in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claims paying ability of such insurer deteriorates financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity has no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events a monthly premium is paid by each insured trust for the insurance obtained by such trust which is payable from the interest income received by such trust in the case of preinsured bonds no premiums for insurance are paid by the insured trust financial guaranty insurance company under the provisions of the aforementioned portfolio insurance issued by financial guaranty financial guaranty unconditionally and irrevocably

been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption acceleration or other advancement of maturity and means when referring to interest on a bond the stated date for payment of interest except that when the interest on a bond shall have been determined as provided in the underlying documentation relating to such bond to be subject to federal income taxation due for payment also means when referring to the principal of such bond the date on which such bond has been called for mandatory redemption as a result of such determination of taxability and when referring to interest on such bond the accrued interest at the rate provided in such documentation to the date on which such bond has been called for such mandatory redemption together with any applicable redemption premium the term due for payment will not include when referring to either the principal of a bond or the interest on a bond any acceleration of payment unless such acceleration is at the sole option of financial guaranty financial guaranty will make such payments to the fiscal agent on the date such principal or interest becomes due for payment or on the business day next following the day on which financial guaranty shall have received notice of nonpayment

pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of financial guaranty the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee will exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise the insured trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basis the insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance is determined based upon the insurability of each bond

information or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof in determining whether to insure bonds financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity has applied its own standards which are not necessarily the same as the criteria used in regard to the selection of bonds by the sponsor this decision is made prior to the initial date of deposit as bonds not covered by such insurance are not deposited in an insured trust unless such bonds are preinsured bonds the insurance obtained by an insured trust covers bonds deposited in such trust and physically delivered to the trustee in the case of bearer bonds or registered in the name of the trustee or its nominee or delivered along with an assignment in the case of registered bonds or registered in the name of the trustee or its nominee in the case of bonds held in bookentry form contracts to purchase bonds are not covered by the insurance obtained by an insured trust although bonds underlying such contracts are covered by insurance upon physical delivery to the trustee insurance obtained by each insured trust or by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units of such trust the insurance obtained by an insured trust is effective only as to bonds owned by and held in such trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee the insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale in the event of a sale of a bond insured by an insured trust the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance upon the payment of an insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an insured trust including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units only if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in page  payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bonds not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringhow is the public offering price determined herein for a more complete description of the evaluators method of valuing defaulted bonds and bonds which have a significant risk of default insurance on a preinsured bond is effective as long as such bond is outstanding therefore any such insurance may be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to the bonds thus insured but the exact effect if any of this insurance on such market value cannot be predicted a contract of insurance obtained by an insured trust and the negotiations in respect thereof represent the only relationship between financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity and the fund otherwise neither financial guaranty nor its parent fgic corporation or

of principal and interest and on the basis of the financial condition of the insurance companies referred to above standard  poors has assigned to units of each insured trust its aaa investment rating this is the highest rating assigned to securities by standard  poors see description of bond ratings the obtaining of this rating by each insured trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the units by standard  poors or as a guarantee of the market value of each insured trust or the units of such trust standard  poors has indicated that this rating is not a recommendation to buy hold or sell units nor does it take into account the extent to which expenses of each trust or sales by each trust of bonds for less than the page  purchase price paid by such trust will reduce payment to unit holders of the interest and principal required to be paid on such bonds such rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the initial date of deposit of an insured trust and will unless renewed terminate at the end of such period there is no guarantee that the aaa investment rating with respect to the units of an insured trust will be maintained an objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such insured trust is to obtain a higher yield on the bonds in the portfolio of such trust than would be available if all the bonds in such portfolio had the standard  poors aaa andor moodys investors service inc aaa ratings and at the same time to have the protection of insurance of scheduled payment of interest and principal on the bonds there is of course no certainty that this result will be achieved bonds in a trust for which insurance has been obtained by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others all of which were rated aaa by standard  poors andor aaa by moodys investors service inc may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds rated aaa by standard  poors or aaa by moodys investors service inc in selecting bonds for the portfolio of each insured trust the sponsor has applied the criteria herein before described what is the federal tax status of unit holders see part three for each trust for information with respect to exemption from state or other local taxes see part three for each trust what are the expenses and charges with the exception of bookkeeping and other administrative services provided to the trusts for which the sponsor will be reimbursed in amounts as set forth under special trust information in each part one of this prospectus the sponsor will not receive any fee in connection with its activities relating to the trusts for series  and all subsequent series first trust advisors lp an affiliate of the sponsor will receive an annual supervisory fee which is not to exceed the amount set forth in part one for each trust for providing portfolio supervisory services for the trust such fee is based on the number of units outstanding in each trust on january  of each year except for trusts which were established subsequent to the last january  in which case the fee will be based on the number of units outstanding in such trusts as of the respective initial dates of deposit for each valuation of the bonds in a trust the evaluator will receive a fee as indicated in part one of this prospectus the trustee pays certain expenses of each trust for which it is reimbursed by such trust the trustee will receive for its ordinary recurring services to a trust an annual fee computed as indicated in part one of this prospectus for a discussion of the services performed by the trustee pursuant to its obligations under the indenture reference is made to the material set forth under rights of unit holders the trustees and evaluators fees are payable monthly on or before each distribution date from the interest account of each trust to the extent funds are available and then from the principal account of such trust since the trustee has the use of the funds being held in the principal and interest accounts for future distributions payment of expenses and redemptions and since such accounts are noninterestbearing to unit holders the trustee benefits thereby part of the trustees compensation for its services to the fund is expected to result from the use of these funds however the trustee may bear from its own resources certain expenses relating to a trust each of the above mentioned fees may be increased without approval of the unit holders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category all services less rent of shelter in the consumer price index published by the united states department of labor in addition with respect to the fees payable to the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services and supervisory services such individual fees may exceed the actual costs of providing such services for a trust but at no time will the total amount received for such services rendered to all unit investment trusts of which nike securities lp is the sponsor in any calendar year exceed the actual cost to the sponsor or its affiliate of supplying such services in such year the annualized cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the fund for each insured trust is indicated in part one for each trust in a series page  of the fund the portfolio insurance continues so long as such trust retains the bonds thus insured premiums are payable monthly in advance by the trustee on behalf of such trust as bonds in the portfolio are redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by the trustee the amount of premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds no longer owned by and held in the trust which were insured by insurance obtained by such trust preinsured bonds for which insurance has been obtained from financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity or beginning with series  and all subsequent series other insurers are not insured by such trust the premium payable for permanent insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of such bond in the event the trustee exercises the right to obtain permanent insurance on a bond the premiums for such permanent insurance with respect to each bond will decline over the life of the bond an advantage trust is not insured accordingly there are no premiums for insurance payable by such trust the following additional charges are or may be incurred by a trust all expenses including legal and annual auditing expenses of the trustee incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the indenture except in the event of negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part the expenses and costs of any action undertaken by the trustee to protect the trust and the rights and interests of the unit holders fees of the trustee for any extraordinary services performed under the indenture indemnification of the trustee for any loss liability or expense incurred by it without negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part arising out of or in connection with its acceptance or administration of the trust indemnification of the sponsor for any loss liability or expense incurred without gross negligence bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as depositor of the trust all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the bonds or any part of the trust no such taxes or charges are being levied or made or to the knowledge of the sponsor are contemplated and expenditures incurred in contacting unit holders upon termination of the trust the above expenses and the trustees annual fee when paid or owing to the trustee are secured by a lien on the trust in addition the trustee is empowered to sell bonds of a trust in order to make funds available to pay all these amounts if funds are not otherwise available in the interest and principal accounts of the trust unless the sponsor determines that such an audit is not required the indenture requires the accounts of each trust to be audited on an annual basis at the expense of the trust by independent auditors selected by the sponsor so long as the sponsor is making a secondary market for units the sponsor shall bear the cost of such annual audits to the extent such cost exceeds  per unit unit holders of a trust covered by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements from the trustee upon request public offering how is the public offering price determined although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for the units and continuously to offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid price of the bonds in the portfolio of each trust plus the amount of purchased interest of a trust if any and interest accrued to the date of settlement all expenses incurred in maintaining a market other than the fees of the evaluator and the costs of the trustee in transferring and recording the ownership of units will be borne by the sponsor if the supply of units exceeds demand or for some other business reason the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices if a unit holder wishes to dispose of his units he should inquire of the sponsor as to current market prices prior to making a tender for redemption to the trustee prospectuses relating to certain other bond funds indicate an intention subject to change on the part of the respective sponsors of such funds to repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price higher than the bid prices of the securities in the funds consequently depending upon the prices actually paid the repurchase price of other sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on a somewhat more favorable basis than the repurchase price offered by the sponsor for units of a trust in secondary market transactions as in the first trust combined series the purchase price per unit of such bond funds will depend primarily on the value of the securities in the portfolio of the applicable trust the public offering price of units of a trust will be determined by adding to the evaluators determination of the aggregate bid price of page  the bonds in a trust plus the amount of purchased interest of a trust if any and the appropriate sales charge determined in accordance with the schedule set forth below based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity of each bond in the portfolio of the trust adjusting the total to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the principal account of the trust and dividing the result by the number of units of such trust then outstanding the minimum sales charge on units will be  of the public offering price equivalent to  of the net amount invested for purposes of computation bonds will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless a the bonds have been called for redemption or funds or securities have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier call date in which case such call date will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature or b such bonds are subject to a mandatory tender in which case such mandatory tender will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature the offering price of bonds in the trust may be expected to be greater than the bid price of such bonds by approximately  of the aggregate principal amount of such bonds the effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the various bonds in the trusts based upon the maturities of such bonds in accordance with the following schedule secondary offering period sales charge percentage percentage of public of net offering amount years to maturity price invested     months to  year    but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     or more   there will be no reduction of the sales charges for volume purchases a dealer will receive from the sponsor a dealer concession of  of the total sales charges for units sold by such dealer and dealers will not be eligible for additional concessions for units sold pursuant to the above schedule an investor may aggregate purchases of units of two or more consecutive series of a particular state national discount intermediate long intermediate or short intermediate trust for purposes of calculating the discount for volume purchases listed above additionally with respect to the employees officers and directors including their immediate family members defined as spouses children grandchildren parents grandparents mothersinlaw fathersinlaw sonsinlaw and daughters inlaw and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such person of the sponsor and brokerdealers and their subsidiaries and vendors providing services to the sponsor may purchase units of the trusts during the secondary market at the public offering price less the concession the sponsor typically allows brokerdealers any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the selling brokerdealer the reduced sales charge structure will apply on all purchases of units in a trust by the same person on any one day from the sponsor or any one brokerdealer and for purposes of calculating the applicable sales charge purchases of units in the fund will be aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from the sponsor or such brokerdealer of units in any series of taxexempt unit investment trusts sponsored by nike securities lp additionally units purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser will be deemed for the purpose of calculating the applicable sales charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser the reduced sales charges will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust estate or single fiduciary account from time to time the sponsor may implement programs under which brokerdealers and other selling agents of the fund may receive nominal awards from the sponsor for each of their registered representatives who page  have sold a minimum number of uit units during a specified time period in addition at various times the sponsor may implement other programs under which the sales force of brokerdealers and other selling agents may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such brokerdealer or other selling agent that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participates in sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying brokerdealers and other selling agents for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trusts such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own assets and not out of the assets of the trusts these programs will not change the price unit holders pay for their units or the amount that the trusts will receive from the units sold a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns and estimated longterm returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on the trust and returns over specified periods on other similar trusts sponsored by nike securities lp with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust us government bonds for example are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and bank cds and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal government money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal but pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the shortterm debt market the investment characteristics of the trust are described more fully elsewhere in this prospectus the aggregate price of the bonds in each trust is determined by the evaluator the evaluator on the basis of bid prices  on the basis of current market prices for the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the trust  if such prices are not available for any of the bonds on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds  by determining the value of the bonds by appraisal or  by any combination of the above unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an insured trust on the other hand the value of insurance obtained by the issuer of bonds in a trust is reflected and included in the market value of such bonds the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the defaulted bonds and which are covered by insurance obtained by an insured trust the value of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity to meet its commitments under an insured trusts insurance policy including the commitments to issue permanent insurance it is the position of the sponsor that this is a fair method of valuing the bonds and the insurance obtained by an insured trust and reflects a proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the investment company act of  the evaluator will be requested to make a determination of the aggregate price of the bonds in each trust on a bid price basis as of the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day on which it is open effective for all sales purchases or redemptions made subsequent to the last preceding determination although payment is normally made three business days following the order for purchase payment may be made prior thereto a person will become owner of the units on the date of settlement

short intermediate trust notwithstanding the foregoing brokerdealers or other selling agents who purchase in the aggregate  of the trusts on any day will receive a volume concession or agency commission of  per unit however resales of units of a trust by such brokerdealers and other selling agents to the public will be made at the public offering price described in this prospectus the sponsor reserves the right to change the amount of the concession or agency commission from time to time certain commercial banks are making units of the fund available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted to the banks in the amounts indicated in the amounts indicated above under the glasssteagall act banks are prohibited from underwriting units however the glasssteagall act does permit certain agency transactions and the banking regulators have not indicated that these particular agency transactions are not permitted under such act in texas and in certain other states any banks making units available must be registered as brokerdealers under state law from time to time the sponsor may implement programs

ratings standard  poors a brief description of the applicable standard  poors rating symbols and their meanings follow a standard  poors corporate or municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this assessment may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other circumstances the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations l likelihood of defaultcapacity and willingness of the obligor as to the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation ll nature of and provisions of the obligation lll protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaabonds rated aaa have the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong aabonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree abonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories bbbbonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds in higher rated categories plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings the letter p indicates that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion the investor should exercise hisher own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk credit watch credit watch highlights potential changes in ratings of bonds and other fixed income securities it focuses on events and trends which place companies and government units under special surveillance by sps member analytical staff these may include mergers voter referendums actions by regulatory authorities or developments gleaned from analytical reviews unless otherwise noted a rating decision will be made within  days issues appear on credit watch where an event situation or deviation from trends occurred and needs to be evaluated as to its impact on credit ratings a listing however does not mean a rating change is inevitable since sp continuously monitors all of its ratings credit watch is not intended to include all issues under review thus rating changes will occur without issues appearing on credit watch n

investors service inc rating symbols and their meanings follow aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues their safety is so absolute that with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances characteristically their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat large than in aaa securities their market value is virtually immune to all but money market influences with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future the market value of arated bonds may be influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained period of depressed business conditions but during periods of normalcy arated bonds frequently move in parallel with aaa and aa obligations with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances a  and baa bonds which are rated a  and baa  offer the maximum in security within their quality group can be bought for possible upgrading in quality and additionally afford the investor an opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness of offerings in the market place baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well the market value of baarated bonds is more sensitive to changes in economic circumstances and aside from occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class baa market valuations will move in parallel with aaa aa and a obligations during periods of economic normalcy except in instances of oversupply moodys bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic rating classification the modifier  indicates that the bond ranks at the high end of its category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category conbonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally these are bonds secured by a earnings of projects under construction b earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience c rentals which begin when facilities are completed or d payments to which some other limiting condition attaches parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis of condition fitch investors service inc a brief description of the applicable fitch investors service inc rating symbols and their meanings follow aaabonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality the obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay principal which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events aabonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong although not quite as strong as bonds rated aaa bonds rated in the aaa and aa categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future developments abonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered

impact on these bonds and therefore impair timely payment the likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings to provide more

the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities neither the sponsor chapman and cutler nor any of the special counsel to the fund for state tax matters have made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for such opinions if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on which interest is determined to be taxable gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unit holder is however includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes it should be noted in this connection that such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from federal income tax purposes at the time of the closing for each trust chapman and cutler counsel for the sponsor rendered an opinion under then existing law substantially to the effect that  the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which are excludable from gross income under the internal revenue code of  the code will retain its status when distributed to a unit holder however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax an additional tax on branches of foreign corporations and the environmental tax the superfund tax see certain tax matters applicable to corporate unit holders  each unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset of the respective trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a bond or when the unit holder redeems or sells his units unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective trust if any on bonds delivered after the date the unit holders pay for their units to all parts of the prospectus should be retained for future reference these securities have not been approved or disapproved by the securities and exchange commission or any state securities commission nor has the securities and exchange commission or any state securities commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense page  the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds during the period from the unit holders settlement date to the date such bonds are delivered to the respective trust and consequently such unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment on maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unit holder the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unit holders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unit holders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unit holder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrual original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost and  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unit holder acquires his unit and the price the unit holder pays for his unit unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application see portfolio appearing in part one for each trust for information relating to bonds if any issued at an original issue discount the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects tax exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for bonds or the price a unit holder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unit holders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to most corporations page  in the case of certain of the bonds in a trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related person as so defined should contact his tax adviser in general section  of the code provides that  of social security benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of the social security benefits received exceeds the base amount the base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including taxexempt interest to the extent that social security benefits are includible in gross income they will be treated as any other item of gross income in addition under the tax act for taxable years beginning after december   up to  of social security benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of social security benefits received exceeds an adjusted base amount the adjusted base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns although taxexempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion if any of social security benefits will be included in gross income no taxexempt interest including that received from a trust will be subject to tax a taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount must include  or  respectively of his social security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives any taxexempt interest a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income after inclusion of taxexempt interest does not exceed the base amount need not include any social security benefits in gross income in the case of corporations the alternative tax rate applicable to long term capital gains is  effective for longterm capital gains realized in taxable years beginning on or after january   for taxpayers other than corporations net capital gains are subject to a maximum stated marginal tax rate of  however it should be noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary income and capital gains are taxed under the code taxpayers must disclose to the internal revenue service the amount of taxexempt interest earned during the year for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations and the superfund tax for corporations interest on certain private activity bonds which includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds issued on or after august   is included as an item of tax preference certain tax matters applicable to corporate unit holders the alternative minimum tax and the superfund tax for taxable years beginning after december   depends upon the corporations alternative minimum taxable income amti which is the corporations taxable income with certain adjustments one of the adjustment items used in computing amti and the superfund tax of a corporation other than an s corporation regulated investment company real estate

operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all tax exempt interest including interest on all of the bonds in the trusts under current code provisions the superfund tax does not apply to tax years beginning on or after january   legislative proposals have been made that would extend the superfund tax under the provisions of section  of the code a branch profits tax is levied on the effectively connected earnings and profits of certain foreign corporations which include taxexempt interest such as interest on the bonds in the trust unit holders should consult their tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them including the corporate alternative minimum tax the superfund tax and the branch profits tax imposed by section  of the code page  ownership of

deemed to have been received by them when received by a michigan trust interest on the bonds in a michigan trust which is exempt from tax under the michigan income tax laws when received by a michigan

for federal income tax purposes is also not included in the adjusted tax base upon which the single business tax is computed of either a michigan trust or the unit holders if a michigan trust or the unit holders have a taxable event for federal income tax purposes when a michigan trust disposes of a bond whether by sale exchange redemption or payment at maturity or the unit holder redeems or sells his unit an amount equal to any gain realized from such taxable event which was included in the computation of taxable income for federal income tax purposes plus an amount equal to any capital gain of an individual realized in connection with such event but excluded in computing that individuals federal taxable income will be included in the tax base against which after allocation apportionment and other adjustments the single business tax is computed the tax base will be reduced by an amount equal to any capital loss realized from such a taxable event whether or not the capital loss was deducted in computing federal taxable income in the year the loss occurred unit holders should consult their tax advisor as to their status under michigan law any proceeds paid under an insurance policy issued to the trustee of the fund or paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds or by the underwriter of the bonds or the sponsor or others which when received by the unit holders represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the trustee will be excludable from the michigan income tax laws and the single business tax if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid by the issuer of the defaulted obligations while treatment under the michigan intangibles tax is not premised upon the characterization of such proceeds under the internal revenue code the michigan department of treasury should adopt the same approach as under the michigan income tax laws and the single business tax as the tax reform act of  eliminates the capital gain deduction for tax years beginning after december   the federal adjusted gross income the computation base for the michigan income tax of a unit holder will be increased accordingly to the extent such capital gains are realized when a michigan trust disposes of a bond or when the unit holder redeems or sells a unit to the extent such transaction constitutes a taxable event for federal income tax purposes for information with respect to the federal income tax status and other tax matters see what is the federal tax status of unit holders certain considerations investors should be aware that the economy of the state of michigan has in the past proven to be cyclical due primarily to the fact that the leading sector of the states economy is the manufacturing of durable goods while the states efforts to diversify its economy have proven successful as reflected by the fact that the share of employment in the state in the durable goods sector has fallen from  percent in  to  percent in  durable goods manufacturing still represents a sizable portion of the states economy as a result any substantial national economic downturn is likely to have an adverse

such actions could adversely affect state revenues and the financial impact on the local units of government in the areas in which plants are closed could be more severe in addition the state is a party to various legal proceedings some of which could if unfavorably resolved from the point of view of the state substantially affect state programs or finances in recent years the state has reported its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the fiscal years ended september   and  the state reported negative yearend balances in the general

michigan voters approved a school finance reform amendment to the states constitution which among other things increased the state sales tax rate from  to  and placed a cap on property assessment increases for all property taxes concurrent legislation cut the states income tax rate from  to  reduced some property taxes and altered local school funding sources to a combination of property taxes and state revenues some of which is provided from new or increased state taxes the legislation also contained other provisions that alter and in some cases may reduce page  the revenues of local units of government and tax increment bonds could be particularly affected as of january  reforms that have occurred under the amendment have been effective yet the ultimate impact of the constitutional amendment and related legislation cannot be accurately predicted and investors should be alert to the potential effect of such measures upon the operations and revenues of michigan local units of government in addition the state legislature recently adopted a package of state tax cuts including a phaseout of the intangibles tax an increase in exemption amounts for personal income tax and reductions in the single business tax since   tax cuts have been enacted in michigan in  michigan taxpayers will have an additional  billion available the cumulative impact of these  tax cuts will have resulted in savings of  billion to taxpayers by the end of  before reflecting enacted tax cuts and other adjustments the consensus revenue estimate was for a  growth in baseline general fund revenue for fiscal year  or  million the continued phasein of enacted tax cuts and other adjustments reduced the estimated growth of actual general fund revenue receipts to  or  million although all or most of the bonds in the michigan trusts are revenue obligations or general obligations of local governments or authorities rather than general obligations of the state of michigan itself there can be no assurance that any financial difficulties the state may experience will not adversely affect the market value or marketability of the bonds or the ability of the respective obligors to pay interest on or principal of the bonds particularly in view of the dependency of local governments and other authorities upon state aid and reimbursement programs and in the case of bonds issued by the state building authority the dependency of the state building authority on the receipt of rental payments from the state to meet debt service requirements upon such bonds in the  fiscal year the state deferred certain scheduled cash payments to municipalities school districts universities and community colleges while such deferrals were made up at specified later dates similar future deferrals could have an adverse impact on the cash position of some local governmental units additionally the state reduced revenue sharing payments to municipalities below that level provided under formulas by

bonds of local units of government pledging the full faith and credit of the local unit which are payable from the levy of ad valorem taxes on taxable property within the jurisdiction of the local unit such bonds issued prior to december   or issued after december   with the approval of the electors of the local unit are payable from property taxes levied without limitation as to rate or amount with respect to bonds issued after december   and which were not approved by the electors of the local unit the tax levy of the local unit for debt service purposes is subject to constitutional statutory and charter tax rate limitations in addition several major industrial corporations have instituted challenges of their ad valorem property tax assessments in a number of local municipal units in the state if successful such challenges could have an adverse impact on the ad valorem tax bases of such units which could adversely affect their ability to raise funds for operation and debt service requirements the foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of bonds held by the michigan trusts are subject additionally many factors including national economic social and environmental policies and conditions which are not within the control of the issuers of the bonds could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the issuers the sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds the market value or marketability of the bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the bonds

located from state income taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes neither the sponsor chapman and cutler nor any of the special counsel to the fund for state tax matters have made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for such opinions if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on which interest is determined to be taxable gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unit holder is includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the

reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from federal income tax purposes at the time of the closing for each trust chapman and cutler counsel for the sponsor rendered an opinion under then existing law substantially to the effect that  the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which are excludable from gross income under the internal revenue code of  the code will retain its status for federal income tax purposes when received by the trusts and when distributed to a unit holder however such interest may be taken into

commission nor has the securities and exchange commission or any state securities commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense page   each unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset of the respective trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a bond or when the unit holder redeems or sells his units if the unit holder disposes of a unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the bonds represented by the unit legislative proposals have been made that would treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain as constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain but not loss unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to any such constructive sale rules unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective trust if any on bonds delivered after the date the unit holders pay for their units to the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds before the date the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller and consequently such unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment on maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unit holder subject to various nonrecognition provisions of the code the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unit holders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unit holders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unit holder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units it should be noted that certain legislative proposals have been made which could affect the calculation of basis for unit holders holding securities that are substantially identical to the bonds unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the calculation of basis the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost and  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unit holder acquires his unit and the price the unit holder pays for his unit unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application see portfolio appearing in part one for each trust for information relating to bonds if any issued at an original issue discount page  the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects tax exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for bonds or the price a unit holder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unit holders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to most corporations investors with questions regarding these issues should consult their tax advisers in the case of certain of the bonds in a trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related person as so defined should contact his tax adviser in general section  of the code provides that  of social security benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of the social security benefits received exceeds the base amount the base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including taxexempt interest to the extent that social security benefits are includible in gross income they will be treated as any other item of gross income in addition under the tax act for taxable years beginning after december   up to  of social security benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of social security benefits received exceeds an adjusted base amount the adjusted base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns although taxexempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion if any of social security benefits will be included in gross income no taxexempt interest including that received from a trust will be subject to tax a taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount must include  or  respectively of his social security benefits in gross income whether or not he

opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities neither the sponsor chapman and cutler nor any of the special counsel to the fund for state tax matters have made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for such opinions if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on which interest is determined to be taxable gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unit holder is however includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes it should be noted in this connection that such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from federal income tax purposes at the time of the closing for each trust chapman and cutler counsel for the sponsor rendered an opinion under then existing law substantially to the effect that  the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which are excludable from gross income under the internal revenue code of  the code will retain its status when distributed to a unit holder however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax an additional tax on branches of foreign corporations and the environmental tax the superfund tax see certain tax matters applicable to corporate unit holders  each unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset of the respective trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a bond or when the unit holder redeems or sells his units unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective trust if any on bonds delivered after the date the unit holders pay for their units to all parts of the prospectus should be retained for future reference these securities have not been approved or disapproved by the securities and exchange commission or any state securities commission nor has the securities and exchange commission or any state securities commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense page  the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds during the period from the unit holders settlement date to the date such bonds are delivered to the respective trust and consequently such unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment on maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unit holder the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unit holders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unit holders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unit holder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrual original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost and  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unit holder acquires his unit and the price the unit holder pays for his unit unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application see portfolio appearing in part one for each trust for information relating to bonds if any issued at an original issue discount the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects tax exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for bonds or the price a unit holder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unit holders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to most corporations page  in the case of certain of the bonds in a trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related person as so defined should contact his tax adviser in general section  of the code provides that  of social security benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of the social security benefits received exceeds the base amount the base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including taxexempt interest to the extent that social security benefits are includable in gross income they will be treated as any other item of gross income in addition under the tax act for taxable years beginning after december   up to  of social security benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of social security benefits received exceeds an adjusted base amount the adjusted base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns although taxexempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion if any of social security benefits will be included in gross income no taxexempt interest including that received from a trust will be subject to tax a taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount must include  or  respectively of his social security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives any taxexempt interest a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income after inclusion of taxexempt interest does not exceed the base amount need not include any social security benefits in gross income in the case of corporations the alternative tax rate applicable to long term capital gains is  effective for longterm capital gains realized in taxable years beginning on or after january   for taxpayers other than corporations net capital gains are subject to a maximum stated marginal tax rate of  however it should be noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary income and capital gains are taxed under the code taxpayers must disclose to the internal revenue service the amount of taxexempt interest earned

most industrial and housing revenue bonds issued on or after august   is included as an item of tax preference certain tax matters applicable to corporate unit holders the alternative minimum tax and

one of the adjustment items used in computing amti and the superfund tax of a corporation other than an s corporation regulated investment company real estate investment trust or remic is an amount equal to  of the excess of such corporations adjusted current earnings over an amount equal to its amti before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all tax exempt interest including interest on all of the bonds in the trusts under current code provisions the superfund tax does not apply to tax years beginning on or after january   legislative proposals have been made that would extend the superfund tax under the provisions of section  of the code a branch profits tax is levied on the effectively connected earnings and profits of certain foreign corporations which include taxexempt interest such as interest on the bonds in the trust unit holders should consult their tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them including the corporate alternative minimum tax the superfund tax and the branch profits tax imposed by section  of the code page  ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain taxpayers including without limitation corporations subject to either the environmental tax or the branch profits tax financial institutions certain

unit holders in rendering its opinion special counsel has not for timing reasons made an independent review of proceedings related to the issuance of the bonds it has relied on the sponsor for assurance that the bonds have been issued by the commonwealth of pennsylvania or by or on behalf of municipalities or other governmental agencies within the commonwealth at the time of the closing for each pennsylvania trust special counsel to the fund for pennsylvania tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing pennsylvania income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to pennsylvania income taxation substantially to the effect that units evidencing fractional undivided interests in a pennsylvania trust which are represented by obligations issued by the commonwealth of

regulations or other guidance that may be issued by the department of revenue or future court decisions for information with respect to the federal income tax status and other tax matters see what is the federal tax status of unit holders certain considerations investors should be aware of certain factors that might affect the financial conditions of the commonwealth of pennsylvania pennsylvania historically has been identified as a heavy industry state although that reputation has changed recently as the industrial composition of the commonwealth diversified when the coal steel and railroad industries began to decline a more diversified economy was necessary as the traditionally strong industries in the commonwealth declined due to a longterm shift in jobs investment and workers away from the northeast part of the nation the major sources of growth in pennsylvania are in the service sector including trade medical and the health services education and financial institutions pennsylvanias agricultural industries are also an important component of the commonwealths economic structure accounting for more than  billion in crop and livestock products annually while agribusiness and food related industries support  billion in economic activity annually nonagricultural employment in the commonwealth over the ten years ending in  increased at an annual rate of  this rate compares to a  rate for the middle atlantic region and a  rate for the united states during the same period for the last three years employment in the commonwealth has increased  nonmanufacturing employment has increased in recent years to  of total commonwealth employment in  and to  as of december  consequently manufacturing employment constitutes a diminished share of total employment within the commonwealth manufacturing contributing  of  nonagricultural employment and  as of december  has fallen behind both the services sector and the trade sector as the largest single source of employment within the commonwealth in  the services sector accounted for  of all nonagricultural employment while the trade sector accounted for  from  to  pennsylvanias annual average unemployment rate dropped from  to  falling below the national rate in  for the first time in over a decade pennsylvanias annual average unemployment rate remained below the national average from  until  slower economic growth caused the unemployment rate in the commonwealth to rise to  in  and  in  the resumption of faster economic growth resulted in a decrease in the commonwealths unemployment rate to  in  as of january  the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the commonwealth was  compared to  for the united states it should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by local pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations issued by the commonwealth of pennsylvania and there is no page  obligation on the part of the commonwealth to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default financial information for the principal operating funds of the commonwealth is maintained on a budgetary basis of accounting a budgetary basis of accounting is used for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the enacted operating budget and is governed by applicable statutes of the commonwealth and by administrative procedures the commonwealth also prepares annual financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the budgetary basis financial information maintained by the commonwealth to monitor and enforce budgetary control is adjusted at fiscal yearend to reflect appropriate accruals for financial reporting in conformity with gaap financial condition and results of operations the fiscal years  through  were years of recovery for pennsylvania from the recession in  and  the recovery fiscal years were characterized by modest economic growth and low inflation rates in the commonwealth these economic conditions combined with several years of tax reductions following the various tax rate increases and tax base expansions enacted in fiscal  for the general fund produced modest increases in pennsylvanias tax revenues during the period tax revenues from fiscal  through fiscal  rose at an annual average rate of  percent total revenues and other income sources increased during this period by an average annual rate of  percent expenditures and other uses during the fiscal  through fiscal  period rose at a  percent annual rate led by annual average increases of  percent for protection of persons and property program costs and  percent for capital outlay costs expenditure reductions for fiscal  from the previous fiscal year for operating transfers out and for conservation of natural resources program costs were the result of accounting changes affecting the general fund and the motor license fund and a recategorization of expenditures due to a departmental restructuring in the general fund at the close of fiscal  the fund balance for the governmental fund types totaled  million an increase of  million over fiscal  and  million over fiscal  financial results for recent fiscal years gaap basis the fiveyear period from fiscal  through fiscal  recorded a  percent average annual increase in revenues and other sources led by an average annual increase of  percent for intergovernmental revenues the increase for intergovernmental revenues in fiscal  is partly due to an accounting change tax revenues during the fiveyear period increased an average of  percent as modest economic growth low inflation rates and several tax rate reductions and other tax reduction measures constrained the growth of tax revenues the tax reduction measures followed a  billion tax increase measure adopted for the  fiscal year expenditures and other uses during the fiscal  through fiscal  period rose at an average annual rate of  percent led by increases of  percent for protection of persons and property program costs the costs of a prison expansion program and other correctional program expenses are responsible for the large percentage increase a reduction in debt service costs at an average annual rate of  percent over the fiveyear period is a result of reduced shortterm borrowing for cash flow purposes improved financial results and structural cash flow modifications contributed to the lower borrowing efforts to control costs for various social welfare programs and the presence of favorable

of each asset of the respective trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a bond or when the unit holder redeems or sells his units if the unit holder disposes of a unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the bonds represented by the unit legislative proposals have been made that would treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain as constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain but not loss unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to any such constructive sale rules unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective trust if any on bonds delivered after the date the unit holders pay for their units to the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds before the date the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller and consequently such unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment on maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unit holder subject to various nonrecognition provisions of the code the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unit holders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unit holders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unit holder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units it should be noted that certain legislative proposals have been made which could affect the calculation of basis for unit holders holding securities that are substantially identical to the bonds unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the calculation of basis the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost and  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unit holder acquires his unit and the price the unit holder pays for his unit unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application see portfolio appearing in part one for each trust for information relating to bonds if any issued at an original issue discount page  the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects tax exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for bonds or the price a unit holder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unit holders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to most corporations investors with questions regarding these issues should consult their tax advisers in the case of certain of the bonds in a trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined

or the price a unit holder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unit holders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to most corporations page  in the case of certain of the bonds in a trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related person as so defined should contact his tax adviser in general section  of the code provides that  of social security benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of the social security benefits received exceeds the base amount the base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including taxexempt interest to the extent that social security benefits are includable in gross income they will be treated as any other item of gross income in addition under the tax act for taxable years beginning after december   up to  of social security benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of social security benefits received exceeds an adjusted base amount the adjusted base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns although taxexempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion if any of social security benefits will be included in gross income no taxexempt interest including that received from a trust will be subject to tax a taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount must include  or  respectively of his social security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives any taxexempt interest a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income after inclusion of taxexempt interest does not exceed the base amount need not include any social security benefits in gross income in the case of corporations the alternative tax rate applicable to long term capital gains is  effective for longterm capital gains realized in taxable years beginning on or after january   for taxpayers other than corporations net capital gains are subject to a maximum stated marginal tax rate

opinion under then existing north carolina income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to north carolina income taxation substantially to the effect that a north carolina trust is not an association taxable as a corporation under north carolina law with the result that income of a north carolina trust will be deemed to be income of the unit holders interest on the bonds that is exempt from north carolina income tax when received by a north carolina trust will retain its taxexempt status when received by the unit holders unit holders will realize a taxable event when a north carolina trust disposes of a bond whether by sale exchange redemption or payment at maturity or when a unit holder redeems or sells his units or any of them and taxable gains for federal income tax purposes may result in gains taxable as ordinary income for north carolina income tax purposes however when a bond has been issued under an act of the north carolina general assembly that provides that all income from such bond including any profit made from the sale thereof shall be free from all taxation by the state of north carolina any such profit received by a north carolina trust will retain its taxexempt status in the hands of the unit holders unit holders must amortize their proportionate shares of any premium on a bond amortization for each taxable year is accomplished by

be attributable to the fair market value of the north carolina bonds and b the trustee periodically must supply to the north carolina department of revenue at such times as required by the department of revenue a complete description of a north carolina trust and also the name description and value of the obligations held in the corpus of a north carolina trust the opinion of special counsel is based in part on the opinion of chapman and cutler regarding federal tax status of the fund and upon current interpretations of the north carolina department of revenue which are subject to change for information with respect to the federal income tax status and other tax matters see what is the federal tax status of unit holders certain considerations see portfolio appearing in part one for each trust for a list of the debt obligations included in each north carolina trust the portions of the following discussion regarding the financial condition of the state government may not be relevant to general obligation or revenue bonds issued by political subdivisions of the state those portions and the sections which follow regarding the economy of the state are included for the purpose of providing information about general economic conditions that may or may not affect issuers of the north carolina obligations none of the information is relevant to any puerto rico obligations which may be included in the portfolio of a north carolina trust general obligations of a city town or county in north carolina are payable from the general revenues of the entity including ad valorem tax revenues on property within the jurisdiction revenue bonds issued by north carolina political subdivisions include  revenue bonds payable exclusively from revenueproducing governmental enterprises and  industrial revenue bonds college and hospital revenue bonds and other private activity bonds which are essentially nongovernmental debt issues and which are payable exclusively by private entities such as nonprofit organizations and business concerns of all sizes state and local governments have no obligation to provide for payment of such private activity bonds and in many cases would be legally prohibited from doing so the value of such private activity bonds may be affected by a wide variety of factors relevant to particular localities or industries including economic developments outside of north carolina section  of the north carolina general statutes appears to permit any city town school district county or other taxing district to avail itself of the provisions of chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code but only with the consent of the local government commission of the state and of the holders of such percentage or percentages of the indebtedness of the issuer as may be required by the bankruptcy code if any such consent is required thus although limitations apply in certain circumstances political subdivisions might be able to seek the protection of the bankruptcy code state budget and revenues the north carolina state constitution requires that the total expenditures of the state for the fiscal period covered by each budget not exceed the total of receipts during the fiscal period and the surplus remaining in the state treasury at the beginning of the period the states fiscal year runs from july st through june th in november  the voters of the state approved a constitutional amendment giving the governor the power to veto certain legislative matters including budgetary matters since  the state has had a budget surplus in part as a result of new taxes and fees and spending reductions put into place in the early s in addition the state like the nation has experienced economic recovery during the s the general fund balance at the end of the  fiscal year was reported at approximately  million as of november  the amount of uncommitted funds of the state was  million in the  budget prepared by the office of state budget and management it is projected that general fund net revenues will increase  over  this increase is expected to result primarily from growth in the north carolina economy despite a tax reduction package enacted by the legislature during the  legislative session page  the state budget is based upon estimated revenues and a multitude of existing and assumed state and nonstate factors including state and national economic conditions international activity and federal government policies and legislation in april  the north carolina general assembly repealed effective for taxable years beginning on or after january   the tax levied on various forms of intangible personal property the intangibles tax revenues receivable by counties and municipalities will no longer be received instead the legislature has provided for specific appropriations to counties and municipalities in addition in the  session the legislature reduced the corporate income tax rate from  to  phased in over four years and reduced the food tax from  to  it is unclear what effect these developments at the state level may have on the value of the debt obligations in the north carolina trusts litigation litigation against the state include the following leandro et al v state of north carolina and state board of education in may  students and boards of education in five counties in the state filed suit in state court requesting a declaration that the public education system of north carolina including its system of funding violates the state constitution by failing to provide adequate or substantially equal educational opportunities and denying due process of law and violates various statutes relating to public education the suit is similar to a number of suits in other states some of which resulted in holdings that the respective systems of public education funding were unconstitutional under the applicable state law the defendants in such suit filed a motion to dismiss which was denied but then was reversed by the state court of appeals an appeal from this decision is now pending with the north carolina supreme court the north carolina attorney generals office believes that sound legal arguments support the states position but no significant financial impact is expected to result from the ultimate resolution of this case even if adverse to the state faulkenbury v teachers and state employees retirement system peele v teachers and state employees retirement system and woodward v local governmental employees retirement systemplaintiffs are disability retirees who brought class actions in state court challenging changes in the formula for payment of disability retirement benefits and claiming impairment of contract rights breach of fiduciary duty violation of other federal constitutional rights and violation of state constitutional and statutory rights the state estimates that the cost in damages and higher prospective benefit payments to plaintiffs and class members would probably amount to  million or more in faulkenbury  million or more in peele and  million or more in woodward all ultimately payable at least initially from the state retirement system funds upon review in faulkenbury the north carolina court of appeals and supreme court have held that claims made in faulkenbury substantially similar to those in peele and woodward for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of federal constitutional rights brought under the federal civil rights act either do not state a cause of action or are otherwise barred by the statute of limitations in  plaintiffs took voluntary dismissals of their claims for impairment of contract rights in violation of the united states constitution and filed new actions in federal court asserting the same claims along with claims for violation of constitutional rights in the taxation of retirement benefits the federal court actions have been stayed pending the trial in state court the cases have been consolidated and discretionary review by the state supreme court has been allowed the north carolina attorney generals office believes that sound legal arguments support the states position fulton corporation v justus secretary of revenuethe states intangible personal property tax levied on certain shares of stock repealed as of the tax year beginning january   has been challenged by the plaintiff on grounds that it violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution by discriminating against stock issued by corporations that do all or part of their business outside the state the plaintiff a north carolina corporation paid the intangibles tax on stock it owns in other corporations the plaintiff seeks to invalidate the tax in its entirety and to recover tax paid on the value of its shares in other corporations the north carolina court of appeals invalidated the taxable percentage deduction and excised it from the statute beginning with the  tax year the effect of this ruling was to increase collections by rendering all stock taxable on  of its value the north carolina supreme court reversed the court of appeals and held that the tax is valid and page  constitutional the plaintiff appealed to the us supreme court which held that the tax violated the commerce clause of the us constitution and remanded the case to the north carolina supreme court for consideration of possible remedies including refunds on remand the north carolina supreme court determined that the court of appeals was correct in finding that all stock was taxable and moreover that the tax must be applied retroactively the court offered that the legislature could forgive the tax but the court did not have this ability the legislature has not responded as of this date in the event that the general assembly forgives the tax it is estimated that the cost to the state would be  million to issue refunds to those taxpayers who filed protests to the tax and  million to all taxpayers who paid the tax in the subject years other tax cases in davis v michigan  the united states supreme court ruled that a michigan income tax statute which taxed federal retirement benefits while exempting those paid by state and local governments violated the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity at the time of the davis decision north carolina law contained similar exemptions in favor of state and local retirees those exemptions were repealed prospectively beginning with the  tax year all public pension and retirement benefits are now entitled to a  annual exclusion the swanson casesfollowing davis federal retirees filed a class action suit in federal court in  seeking damages equal to the north carolina income tax paid on federal retirement income by the class members a companion suit was filed in state court in  the complaints alleged that the amount in controversy exceeded  million the north carolina department of revenue estimated refunds and interest liability of  million as of june   the north carolina supreme court ultimately held in favor of the state in the case brought in state court and the united states supreme court denied the plaintiffs request for review of that decision thereby concluding the state litigation plaintiffs also were unsuccessful in the federal court action the federal retirees sought relief through state legislation and in  the legislature passed a special refund and tax credit bill that will permit the retirees to recover through credits or in some cases refunds the net tax previously paid that could not be recovered through usual claims the expected cost to the state is approximately  million the bailey casesstate and local government retirees filed a class action suit in  as a result of the repeal of the income tax exemptions for state and local government retirement benefits the original suit was dismissed after the north carolina supreme court ruled in  that the plaintiffs had failed to comply with state law requirements for challenging unconstitutional taxes and the united states supreme court denied review in  many of the same plaintiffs filed a new lawsuit alleging essentially the same claims including breach of contract unconstitutional impairment of contract rights by the state in taxing benefits that were allegedly promised to be taxexempt and violation of several state constitutional provisions although the superior court ruled largely in the plaintiffs favor appeals have been taken from both sides and the north carolina supreme court has allowed discretionary review before hearing by the court of appeals additional suits have been filed to recover taxes subsequently paid the north carolina attorney generals office estimates that the amount in controversy is approximately  million annually for the tax years  through  in addition it is anticipated that the decision reached in this case will govern the resolution of tax refund claims made by retired state and local government employees for taxes paid on retirement benefit income for tax years after  furthermore if the order of the superior court is upheld its provisions would apply prospectively to prevent future taxation of state and local government retirement benefits that were vested before august  the north carolina attorney generals office believes that sound legal arguments support the states position on the merits patton v statein connection with the legislatures repeal of the tax exemption for state retirees in  certain adjustments were adopted that reduced the state retirees tax burden in may  federal retirees filed a lawsuit in state court for tax refunds for the years  through  alleging that these adjustments also constitute unlawful discrimination against federal retirees this action is being held in abeyance pending the outcome in bailey should plaintiffs prevail in bailey such a result these federal retirees allege would reestablish the disparity of treatment between state and federal pension income which was held unconstitutional in davis potential refunds exceed  million page  the state is involved in numerous other claims and legal proceedings many of which normally occur in governmental operations however the north carolina attorney general does not expect any of the outstanding lawsuits to materially adversely affect the states ability to meet its financial obligations general the population of the state has increased  from  from  to  as reported by the  federal census and the state rose from twelfth to tenth in population the states estimate of population as of july  is  notwithstanding its rank in population size north carolina is primarily a rural state having only six municipalities with populations in excess of  the labor force has undergone significant change during recent years as the state has moved from an agricultural to a service and goods producing economy those persons displaced by farm mechanization and farm consolidations have in large measure sought and found employment in other pursuits due to the wide dispersion of nonagricultural employment the people have been able to maintain to a large extent their rural habitation practices during the period  to  the state labor force grew about  from  to  per capita income during the period  to  grew from  to  an increase of  the current economic profile of the state consists of a combination of industry agriculture and tourism as of june  the state was reported to rank eleventh among the states in nonagricultural employment and eighth in manufacturing employment employment indicators have varied somewhat in the annual periods since june of  but have demonstrated an upward trend since  the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in

of cucumbers for pickles and net farm income third in the value of poultry and egg products and greenhouse and nursery income fourth in commercial broilers peanuts blueberries and strawberries and sixth in burley tobacco the diversity of agriculture in north carolina and a continuing push in marketing efforts have protected farm income from some of the wide variations that have been experienced in other states where most of the agricultural economy is dependent on a small number of agricultural commodities north carolina is the third most diversified agricultural state in the nation tobacco production which has been the leading source of agricultural income in the state declined in  the poultry industry is now the leading source of gross agricultural income at  and the pork industry provides over  of the total agricultural income tobacco farming in north carolina has been and is expected to continue to be affected by major federal legislation and regulatory measures regarding tobacco production and marketing and by international competition measures adverse to tobacco farming could have negative effects on farm income and the north carolina economy generally the number of farms has been decreasing in  there were approximately  farms in the state down from approximately  in  a decrease of about  in eight years however a strong agribusiness sector supports farmers with farm inputs fertilizer insecticide pesticide and farm machinery and processing of commodities produced by farmers vegetable canning and cigarette manufacturing north carolinas agriculture industry including food fiber and forest products contributes over  billion annually to the states economy the state department of commerce travel and tourism division reports that in  more than  billion was spent on tourism in the state the department estimates that twothirds of total expenditures came from out ofstate travelers and that approximately  people were employed in tourismrelated jobs the effects of two severe hurricanes in  may have an adverse effect on tourism in certain areas of the state bond ratings currently moodys rates north carolina general obligation bonds as aaa and standard
