needed to drive world class manufacturing operations and the lessons they’ve learned along the way throughout the discussion ballotta and tribié both stress the importance of delivering a quality product “finding out how to make it faster cheaper better is something that a company should deal with later in its stages of maturity” says ballotta “i think that whatever manufacturing strategy
