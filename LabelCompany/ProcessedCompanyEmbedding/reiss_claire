facebook twitter google share email story alerts letter to editor pin it life should be peaceful at la jolla farms that tony area of  superluxury homes adjacent to torrey pines state parkbut war has broken out there one resident controls a local biotech a former resident says she was fraudulently induced to put her life savings in the company she has sued defendants say it’s premature for her to say she has lost her money the company has cleaned house and rebounded they assert kathleen kitty jennings has filed a suit in superior court claiming that she was wooed into investing  million in a privately held company named biocept because of misrepresentations primarily by the company’s former chief executive gordon janko and jennings’s la jolla farms neighbor claire reiss the major shareholder jennings says that she talked facetoface with reiss only about twice a year — at the la jolla farms christmas and fourth of july parties one time the socially prominent reiss exulted that the company was on the verge of releasing a breakthrough product that would rake in money and she was offering her friends the chance to make a buck on “confidential” information according to the suit the company is focused on developing a diagnostic technology for the detection of down syndrome in the first trimester of pregnancy as well as early identification of certain cancers after reiss gave jennings the initial pitch janko gave her what she considers a fraudulent song and dance about biocept’s looming success according to the suit reiss and others including chief financial officer jennifer crittenden didn’t curb his hyperenthusiasm email correspondence shows that reiss promised jennings she would return her money but later reneged the suit charges biocept reiss janko crittenden and others with fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment breach of fiduciary duty and corporate waste among several things defense attorney christopher mcgrath won’t comment “the lawsuit is at a very early stage” he says the company is known to have directors’ and officers’ liability insurance reiss doesn’t want to comment about the suit other than to say “that lady jennings will regret she did this” reiss’s late husband was a prominent biotech investorscientist and had served on biocept’s board reiss appears to have put  million to  million in biocept “the financial problems occurred last year the company is doing beautifully her jennings’s investment is worth a lot” but jennings says she never received an audited financial statement says her lawyer erwin shustak “it is just a question of time before biocept’s money runs out” the suit charges that in its year history the company burned through  million of money raised from investors “and has failed to generate any meaningful revenue or launch any products or technologies into the market” “janko misappropriated a large portion of the company’s monies and assets to finance his own lavish lifestyle” including milliondollar homes and luxury cars according to the suit records indicate he owned four homes during the – years in which he headed the company but it’s possible some were rentals also he had accumulated personal wealth as a result of a corporate buyout before he joined biocept the suit also charges that he owned a company that provided services to biocept i have tried unsuccessfully to reach janko at several locations crittenden would not answer my questions claire reiss contacted kitty jennings in late  according to the suit jennings a divorcée with three teenage sons paid  a share for biocept stock and janko told her the shares would be worth  each in a short period of time the suit charges she was assured that the company would launch a prenatal diagnostic device by late  or early  and it would enjoy a  million market according to the suit she was also told that food and drug administration approval for the product would not be necessary the company had  patents and big pharmaceutical companies coveted biocept’s technology all those claims were false according to the suit in addition she was not told that johnson  johnson perhaps the most successful healthcare colossus was in direct competition with biocept then commenced a series of emails between jennings and reiss on august  of last year reiss said “if what i hoped will not come through by next year i will personally buy your shares from you…i never want to see my friends lose money because they know me” but on september  reiss emailed “i can’t afford to buy your shares right now” jennings citing health problems begged her a second time to relent in those emails reiss admitted to jennings that janko did not tell the truth in hyping biocept’s immediate prospects in august of  reiss said janko “is a great salesman and that is it” she lamented his “country club style” she told how she was lining up investor votes for his ouster jennings wrote back to say “remember you ultimately control the company because you control the money” by midaugust the company was talking to stephen coutts a san diego biotech executive who has a phd in biochemistry from harvard and a master’s of business administration from new york university although for  years he was head of research and development for la jolla pharmaceutical which failed in its attempt to bring out a product on august  coutts said in an email to a former biocept official that “no products are ready for commercialization” and there is “no apparent market analysis or financial modeling” coutts would not comment to me in early fall of  a lawyer representing biocept told janko that if he didn’t depart the company might go out of business — one reason the lawsuit says biocept was almost insolvent by mid coutts was named chief executive on october   reiss then thanked the departing janko for his five years as chief executive the company went about correcting its deficiencies and raising more investor funds on july  of this year biocept named to its board one of san diego’s most distinguished businesspersons m faye wilson a banker who was instrumental in the founding of home depot and served as both a senior officer and board member of that huge retailer wilson had invested funds in biocept in  and had helped recruit coutts other investment funds have come in to the company she won’t comment on the suit but says “i am pleased with the progress the company is making and excited about the prospects for the company it is solvent has adequate funding — very good angel support” jennings can clearly show that she was fed hype that didn’t pan out but did that constitute fraud and can she show that she has lost money at this point facebook twitter google share email story alerts letter to editor pin it more from

didnt do independent research into the companys prospects and competition and then is suing because it didnt work out huh biocept is privately held and its stock does not trade on the public markets

facts in this case biocept made a sales pitch to jennings using company information that was not available to the public biocept broke no laws in providing this information to jennings because the company was privately held and she broke no laws when she acted upon this information she is not an insider trader who acted upon illegally obtained information the sec cannot go after her because she received this information nor can the sec go after biocept for providing it to her no sec laws have been violated jennings is without fault if her accusations against the company are true she is
