website may   last updated  pm talking new media headline news mergersacquisitions tegna to spinoff carscom will hold investor meeting may  by db hebbard   days ago  share this facebook  tweet previous article next article the broadcast company created with its spinoff from the newspaper side of gannett which retained the gannett name will now spinoff one of its digital media assets the broadcast company tegna yesterday announced that it would be spinning off its digital media property carscom and today set a date may  for an investor meeting in nyc the spin is expected to be completed on may   a little background tegna is the new company formed by the splitting up of the old gannett the broadcast side became tegna and the newspaper side remained named as gannett the ceo of gannett gracia martore then became the ceo of tegna if that wasn’t a big enough sign that the broadcast side was the place to be the other big decision was that the digital publishing assets carscom and careerbuilder went not with the print publishing side of the split but with the broadcast side as i wrote in  this really hamstrung the newspaper company that would remain as gannett like the tribune company spinoff the new newspaper company will be forced into agreements with the digital assets that will go to the broadcast side careerbuilder carscom and go digital as a result the newspaper will actually be driving digital growth for the broadcast company while having their hands tied as to new digital initiatives everyone could see that this was a terrible thing to do to gannett “we expect tegna to benefit from acquisitions as well as increased contribution from carscom and careerbuilder” wrote joe cornell for forbes “on the other hand gannett co operates the less promising publishing business with declining traditional print advertising revenues we have revised downwards our target price for gannett co to  per share earlier  implying a  upside from the current price of  per share and downgrade our rating on the stock to hold” gannett’s stock did fall a little after the spinoff but then rose to  at the end of november  it didn’t last today it is trading at  down  percent today likely due to the stories coming out about layoffs at its local newspapers as for tegna now it gets to spinoff another company something that generally proves quite profitable for both the top executives and the shareholders as for those who work at carscom what happens to the new company determined by the conditions set for the spinoff — and the signs are not good from the release see in full below “prior to the separation carscom will make a onetime cash distribution of  million to tegna carscom expects to enter into new credit facilities with borrowing capacity of approximately  million and expects a portion of the facilities will remain undrawn at closing” it is actually shocking that tegna shares tgna are not climbing today after the details of the spinoff were made public especially since tegna said also below that it would use its  million windfall in a stock repurchase initiative which also should boost the stock here is the announcement for the carscom spinoff mclean va— may   — tegna inc today announced that its board of directors has approved the previously announced spinoff of carscom which will create two publicly traded companies tegna an innovative media company with the largest broadcast group among major network affiliates in the top  markets and carscom a leading digital automotive marketplace the spinoff will be effected through a pro rata distribution of all outstanding shares of carscom to tegna stockholders of record at the close of business on may   the “record date” stockholders will retain their tegna shares and receive one share of carscom for every three shares of tegna stock they own on the record date carscom shares are expected to begin “regular way” trading on june   the spinoff remains subject to the conditions described in the preliminary information statement filed by carscom on form  with the us securities and exchange commission gracia martore president and ceo of tegna who will retire upon the closing of the spinoff said “today’s milestone brings us one step closer to creating two industryleading companies with the right focus resources and leadership to capture the unique opportunities
