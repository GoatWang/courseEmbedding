earnings results conference call todays conference is being recorded at this time id like to turn the conference to kim ulmer vice president and controller please go ahead maam kimberly i ulmer  vice president  controller thank you joining me from the company today i have tony allott president and ceo bob lewis evp and cfo and adam greenlee evp and coo before we begin the call today we would like to make it clear that certain statements made today on this conference call may be forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are made based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company and therefore involve a number of uncertainties and risks including but not limited to those described in the companys annual report on form k for  and other filings with the sec therefore the actual results of operations or financial condition of the company could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements with that ill turn it over to tony anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks kim welcome everyone to our third quarter  earnings conference call our agenda for this morning will focus on the financial performance for the third quarter and to review our outlook for  after the prepared remarks bob adam and i will be pleased to answer any questions as you saw in the press release adjusted earnings per diluted share were below our expectations at  for the third quarter versus  in the same period a year ago while we fully expected  to be a challenging and transitional year for each of our businesses there is no question the performance in the plastic container business has been disappointing and well below our expectations as with plastics business i believe its important to take a minute and review our longerterm situation and why we embarked on this significant rationalization effort and elaborate on the recent challenges the plastic bottle business has undergone significant change in recent years with increased customer focus on nearsite production high support requirement and continuous cost reductions in order to meet these needs and to capitalize on our belief that no supplier fully meets the needs we believe its vital to address the legacy costs and geographic proximity of our business one of the strengths of our plastic business is its wide variety of manufacturing platforms and technologies available to meet our customers unique needs unfortunately this strength presents a challenge during restructuring activities as we operate a significant number of specific equipment platforms with production capacities dedicated to and paired closely with customerspecific volumes this tight production capacity model mandates that when we – when any manufacturing line is moved sufficient inventory must be built the line must be moved within a small window of time while training new employees in a new location to operate the equipment upon installation therefore if any issues arise they can become large problems very quickly our job is to deal with these challenges as they are identified and under any circumstances to protect our customers by maintaining service and supply throughout this transition this plan was aggressive and problems have arisen accordingly we are incurring significantly higher incremental costs associated with mitigating the impact of these issues on our customers during the quarter we incurred direct incremental costs associated with the plastic footprint optimization and the efforts to minimize the impact of these activities on our customers these incremental costs will continue as we go forward for the next several quarters and where possible and helpful we may elect to slow down some of these activities in strengthening our response to these challenges weve also made several management changes to the plastics team including naming jay martin as the president of silgan plastics jay was previously the president of silgan plastic closure solutions and most recently led the successful portola integration and related footprint optimization program within the closures business in the us our metal container business delivered  volume growth as a result of new volumes associated with the van can acquisition continued growth in pet food in the us and solid volumes in the european business however despite a great start the us fruit and vegetable pack was below expectations as the pack ended abruptly in september as weve seen earlier in the year our metal container team did a good job meeting this increased demand and the previously discussed shift in geographic customer requirements from our existing infrastructure this effort continues to drive higher manufacturing costs and outoforder freight and logistics costs while our footprint optimization is progressing on schedule the new plant is scheduled to start off in the early part of  and well then go through customer qualifications therefore some of these incremental costs will persist until the second half of  later in the year we anticipate easing our capacity limitations and then beginning to reduce other inefficiently located capacity in the system our closure business continues to perform well having successfully completed its footprint optimization program in the quarter based on our yeartodate performance and our outlook for remainder of the year we are revising our fullyear estimate of adjusted earnings per share in a range of  to  this estimate assumes similar fourth quarter incremental cost levels in the plastic container and metal food can business as we incurred in the third quarter with that ill now turn it over to bob to review the financial results in more detail and provide additional explanation around our earnings estimates for  robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer thank you tony good morning everyone tony provided an overview of the challenges we faced during the quarter so ill focus my comments on the financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook for the balance of  on a consolidated basis net sales for the third quarter of  were  billion a decrease of  million as decreases in the plastic container and closure businesses due partly to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency were partially offset by increased sales in the metal container business the aggregate impact of foreign currency across all of our businesses unfavorably impacted revenue by  million in the quarter net income for the third quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to third quarter of  net income of  million or  per share the results for  included rationalization charges of  million for a total increase to earnings per share of  while results for  included rationalization charges of  million and net income in venezuela of  for a net increase to earnings per share of  as a result we delivered adjusted income per diluted share of  in  versus  in  interest and other debt expense decreased  million or  million for the quarter primarily as a result of lower weighted average borrowing rates and an unfavorable – and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation as we continue to make progress on the new plant startups net capital expenditures for the third quarter of  totaled  million compared with  million in the prioryear quarter yeartodate net capital expenditures totaled  million versus  million in the prior year additionally we paid a quarterly dividend of  per share in september with a total cash cost of  million yeartodate share repurchases totaled  million ill now provide some specifics regarding financial performance of our three business franchises the metal container business recorded net sales of  million for the third quarter of  an increase of  million or  versus the prioryear quarter this increase is primarily a result of  higher unit volumes partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency of  million volumes were higher yearoveryear as a result of incremental us volumes associated with the van can acquisition and continued growth in pet food and europe was also stronger on a yearoveryear basis income from operations in the metal container business was  million for the third quarter  versus  million in the same period a year ago the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs due largely to logistical challenges from changes in customer demand patterns which was further exacerbated as a result of higher volumes and a less favorable mix of products sold including volumes associated with the less efficient van can operations these were partially offset by higher volumes net sales in the closure business decreased  million to  million for the quarter primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of  million the passthrough of lower resin costs and the cessation of operations in venezuela at the end of  partially offset by a  improvement in unit volumes income from operations in the closure business for the third quarter of  was  million down  versus the prioryear quarter this reduction was primarily a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by better operating performance as a result of the benefits of the portola integration and plant optimization programs the favorable impact from the lagged passthrough of decreases in resin costs in the current year quarter versus the unfavorable impact from resin in the prioryear quarter and higher unit volumes net sales in the plastic container business were  million for the third quarter of  down  million versus the prioryear quarter this decrease was largely due to the passthrough of lower raw material costs the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of  million a  decline in volumes and the unfavorable impact from recent longerterm customer contract renewals the loss from operations was  million for the third quarter of  versus income from operations in the prioryear quarter of  million this decrease was primarily related to higher rationalization charges significant costs and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the footprint optimization program the unfavorable impact from recent longerterm customer contract renewals a customer reimbursement for historical project costs in the prioryear period lower volumes and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by the favorable impact of the lagged passthrough of decreases in resin costs the rationalization charges for the shutdown of two facilities in the midwest totaled  million for the quarter turning now to our outlook for  based on our yeartodate performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year we are reducing our estimate of adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of  to  down from a range of  to  per share this estimate excludes the impact from certain adjustments outlined in table b of our press release were also providing a fourth quarter  estimate of adjusted earnings in the range of  to  per diluted share excluding rationalization charges this estimate compares to adjusted net income per diluted share of  in the prioryear quarter the decline on a yearoveryear basis is largely due to the continuation of incremental costs similar to those in the third quarter associated with our footprint optimization programs in both the plastic and metal container businesses lower pound volumes in plastics and the impact from an abrupt end to the fruit and vegetable pack despite the reduction in forecasted earnings we continue to forecast free cash flow generation to be approximately  million largely a result of the slight shift of capital spending from  to  that concludes our prepared comments so well turn it over for a qa and ill turn it back to augusta who can provide directions for the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you sir well go first to adam josephson of keybanc adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks good morning everyone anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good morning adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc tony or bob can you talk about exactly what happened in the plastics business in the quarter such that your cost ended up much higher than you were anticipating just to give us some idea of what transpired adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure adam its adam and just talking about the performance of plastics versus our expectations a couple of things one were working really hard to protect our customers and maintain the service and supply albeit at a significantly higher cost so if you talk about our previous expectations we said q was going to look a lot like q and in doing so the difference really falls into three buckets so we had about  million of incremental operating costs that hit us in the quarter all to serve our customers volume was a negative on the quarter of about  million as well and then we had inventoryrelated activities that hit us for about  million all of which were not included in our guidance when we talked last quarter anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director so what happened is basically you have a couple of plants that were – because of all this movement the need to build inventory plants just fell behind on the production side and so the spend is basically – that creates pinch points of capacity puts pressure on assets that you really want to move et cetera so i think adam is talking about our costs we spent basically it was all those issues people costs equipmentrelated costs et cetera and so that – i think that answers the question adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc got it no thanks tony and on the incremental costs that you talked about in the fourth quarter and beyond in both plastics and metal cans can you give us some perspective as to how significant these incremental costs will be next year and some idea of whether you expect these related costs to be higher or lower in  versus  anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure if you – so if you talk about – well take the plastics side first kind of yeartodate these incremental costs that were talking about which are labor et cetera so incremental spend is  million yeartodate that number looks like its going to – it will end up being kind of in the  million range so another  million in q in containers the metal food can side we have been talking all along about a  million to  million so just to be clear in neither case are these numbers a surprise we knew we have these – i think in plastics the total number is bigger than we thought and on the container side that  million to  million i think by the time were done thats going to look a little more like  million in the year and so youll have another – in the current quarter that was sort of an  million range although this is our seasonally peak quarter both of those are going to continue into next year in the case of plastics its going to continue as we – as we continue to stabilize the business and slowly try to recover so thats going to be a couple of quarters that were going to see that come into the year and then on the container side as i said in the prepared remarks until the line gets up in kind of lateish – in the first quarter as we begin qualification it will kind of ease those costs off as that capacity comes available to us but both of these spends will continue into  for sure adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks and i – just two others then ill get back back to plastics i mean your margins have fluctuated rather dramatically in recent years in this business and youve been asked on occasion about whether you should be in this business long term why today do you think you should remain in this business long term in light of what youre experiencing anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director well what i would say is what were experiencing is is transitional im not trying to make light of it its a big deal weve got a lot of effort on it you can see just by how much were spending we dont take it lightly at all but this is – we started the year by saying were going to go do a major rationalization and theres going to be risks around it and so while the number is a little surprising to us the risk that sits here is not at all surprising to us we knew what we had to do was challenging the reason we are doing it as i said in prepared remarks is we continue to believe that the plastics market plastic bottle market is underserved by quality suppliers who do the kind of service that is needed by our customers and so we believe an opportunity still sits there thats worth looking at what we said on last call i think is that we believe this business could get back to – i think we talked ebit margin then i think we talked sort of in the  we really think a little bit more in ebitda and i think weve said midteens and we believe there is a very viable business in that case so we wouldnt take the transitional costs were going to now and making any fundamental decisions on those thats just the cost of what we have to do to get on to a better opportunity for the business which we still believe sits there adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks tony just last one for bob bob on capex youre assuming around  million previously what is that number now and then what do you expect it to be rough order of magnitude next year robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer yeah i think as we look at the capital for this year obviously as we are taking a hard line at when were making payments and how things are coming up to speed there is probably something that looks like call it as much as  million or so maybe even  million that could shift yeartoyear so that could bring the  million down by that in  and then in  we were previously talking about kind of getting back to our  million to  million kind of range adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc right robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer so at a minimum we probably start to look at the higher end of that range and maybe even just a touch above that for next year again were in the midst of beginning and reviewing our budget process so i dont have good visibility to that but thats our thinking right now adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks a lot bob appreciate it operator our next question comes from chris manuel of wells fargo chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc good morning gentlemen anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director hi chris robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer hey chris chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay so i appreciate the color thus far on the plastics and the containers business but i kind of want to drill perhaps a little bit deeper into each lets start with the plastics if we can the restructuring and the work that was going on i mean when i kind of think through the business are there – what areas is it centered around in particular if i kind of think of the high barrier food piece so that was a plant that was kind of doing its own thing so thats  of your revenue thats not impacted by this its probably not happening in the two – when i kind of think through the pieces is this primarily geared towards what youre doing in food and personal care or – can you give us some color there adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah chris its adam yes its – thats exactly where were focused on its our targeted growth markets going forward so food healthcare personal care and really trying to get our footprint in the most optimal spot from a geographic location and ability to support our customers standpoint so what this entails is moving lines that we have existing in our infrastructure to a more strategically located geographic footprint chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer hey chris this is bob just to be crystal clear here this isnt impacting the high barrier food business this is really were talking about our legacy plastic business here chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc right okay thats what i thought so the plan was you were going to be relocating some equipment during q q it sounds like now that sort of – so you gave us some color early on what the costs were that maybe not as much as i was hoping for with respect to why its taking longer and what the pressure points have been that have caused you to increase your expense stuff is it that youve had difficulty getting site prep to move in i mean the volume doesnt seem to be hurting you unlike maybe well talk about metal in a moment but what are the issues here maybe if you give us a little more color as to help us understand what they are that helps us understand how long that could persist adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure and what i would say is number one our new plant construction schedules are right on schedule so this does not have to deal with the new facilities that were building this is really about again kind of our high volume customerspecific dedicated assets moving from one plant to another to be closer to our customers and as we started that process as tony kind of talked about earlier theres a whole bunch of things that have to go right in order for that process to work smoothly and we definitely have hit some bumps in the road if you look at kind of what weve done historically in this business weve had something like  activities  activities around line moves and relocations over time we had an aggressive plan for  something to the tune of  line moves and new lines being installed so we knew it was aggressive we knew it was stepped up versus prior year as you mentioned chris and as tony did as well we have slowed some of those activities here for the back half or the final quarter of the year and were going to focus on continuing to service our customers so we have slowed down to some degree when we stabilize well reinitiate and well continue down the path but one final step removed i would say that we – this program was really a multiyear program from a footprint optimization we had expected to complete the process in  so we are in the middle of it and we do have a ways to go but well get stabilize before we really reinitiate chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc right last question on this before i kind of flip to containers are you buying from outside suppliers and vendors today to meet demand adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes we are chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president in some cases chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay in the metal side again im grossly oversimplifying this but my understanding was you were consolidating activity from handful of plants into two locations maybe three four five into two and then – that was new equipment going into the new facilities so i guess you had a big volume quarter here and maybe had to draw down more inventory than what you anticipated but a are the new plants kind of building online and then b perhaps what were the costs from if you werent going to take these down until the new one was ready to go i guess im maybe a bit perplexed as to what the extra cost expense might have been robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer great question and having read some of the write ups this morning i think this deserves some discussion because the majority of the cost were talking about in container side we knew about we talked about and we had in our forecast so the costs are basically all of the inefficiency recall that two things we had two customers sizable customers that move their field to the midwest which tightened up our midwest systems chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc yeah robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer we also added the van can business and so that all tightened up our system and so as you mentioned that we have a plan to deal with that by building a new plant but we knew no matter what the plant wasnt going to be here to help us this year we were absolutely going to have higher cost to move products around to where it had to be for our customers and to tighten – basically run less sufficiently in the midwest region where we needed to have the cans and so that was all known we talked about  million to  million items the quarter had a couple of million of higher costs in it and thats just mix related its not anything out of control you just – it depends what customers have pulled in what product and so little bit higher costs in the quarter but the bigger point on the container side for the quarter was that we were having a boomer path and we are feeling very good in fact we really – there was a point in the midquarter where we thought the metal food can business was going to help sustain some of the issues were using in plastics unfortunately our packs kind of across the board stopped early you had a cold in the midwest that stopped corn particularly in the upper midwest and then you have water and moisture in california that stopped the tomato pack so while you have great growing conditions all the way up everything looked record – it all kind of stopped now that doesnt mean it was a bad pack we view it more of the normal kind of pack in terms of total volume but it wasnt normal in terms of when it came in came in sooner and ended so that had more to do with the metal food cans third quarter than did – anything to do with costs inefficiencies chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful so then perhaps as we think about  again just a followup in the container space you seem to indicate that some of these issues or problems would continue to linger through the year but if the equipments are running again in the first quarter as you kind of had suggested i think you had suggested why would those continue to persist so long or is there anything perhaps its delayed or that were not appreciating or realizing there robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer no the new plan is basically on schedule were expecting kind of first cans off of it in half of the lines in the first quarter i will say that we did have a very wet beginning season for building the buildings so that schedule hasnt moved has definitely compressed in terms of the finishing of the building and equipment delivery so i would say that risk on that has gone up a little bit but in any case sort of a q wed be getting first cans off but because these are food cans you got to go through individual customer qualifications none of this is news to us by the way maybe we didnt talk a lot about  when we first talked about that but – so were going to be going through qualification in kind of q and q of next year now some customers will get qualified and well start producing cans for them so it will begin to give us some relief but its going to be kind of incremental through q and q we should end the year with full capacity released from the new lines on and the ability to get out some of the other capacity in the system that we said were going to be taking out and thats all on plan chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc thats next year q q you said robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer q q would be the transitional time when were getting qualified and beginning to lead the pressure and then by the end of the year we would expect to be getting – shutting down capacity chris d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you operator well go next to george staphos of bank of america george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch hi guys good morning ill ask a few questions and turn it over so that everyone can get in i would say first question i had maybe piggybacking on chris question how much incremental cost are we looking at in plastics and in containers – metal containers for  versus  and i know youre not in a position to guide now i respect that but is there a chance assuming normal volumes normal pack normal economy relative plastics that  earnings could be relatively flat because of these incremental costs or how would you have us think about that adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah good questions george this is my normal time where i do say we have not done our budgets yet and as you can tell there are a lot of moving parts as there are every year so i think well be getting a little ahead of ourselves to answer the question i think its a legitimate question because what we are saying is were coming in with the cost load so i think there are going to be parts of  that are going to look a little like  in reverse coming in a little bit heavy loaded on the cost side and then getting some of the benefits on the back end where exactly that gets unfortunately is – guidance we cant really give you yet with any kind of certainty around it as per the cost as i said were going to be somewhere in the  million to  million of the sort of incremental costs in that the food can business george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch this year adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president this year in  thats right george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch correct adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president and then i dont have exact number on that yet but were going to certainly carry that for the first half of  so i believe that number should be less next year but i dont think it should go to zero certainly it wont go to zero so i think right now i get a cap of it as an assumption but just recommend thats pretty rough assumption george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch understood adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president on the plastic side i think it could be more comparable in number because i think there is a possibility these costs really ramped up in q and q worse than – or at least our belief of q were saying that continued q and into q my own view is that im a little hopeful by q well be getting to ease those off and well be getting to get some benefits but i think thats putting the cart a little ahead of the horse right now so i think itll more comparable yearonyear on plastic george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch and tony can you remind me what did you say the total costs for this year just so i dont have to scroll back through my notes here for plastics anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director  million george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay fair enough i appreciate the comments there now i remember from last quarter maybe incorrectly so and remind me if thats the case but i thought that you were not – you had said that there was really not a heck of a lot of upward surprise potential from the pack this year in the first place because of all the realignment and so explain why now the fact that the pack came in below expectations you had it sounds like a hard freeze you had wet issues weather issues moisture in the west coast that it wound up being a negative factor in other words because you lost the incremental you thought could offset plastics anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah your memory is correct what i said is that even if we have a boomer that its going – the conversion of that is going to be less than youd expect i dont think i said therell be no conversion from that george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director so by getting less of it is it certainly has an impact i think add to that that there is a mix component here that what we really seem to drop is large cans which on a per unit basis is very significant and so a little bit of mix component of that too but nonetheless were only talking in a pretty big quarter some  million or  million of impact from it so i would still say that it was – it could have been a lot worse if we didnt already have some of these costs that were embedded into the system at that time george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay i guess my last question ill turn it over we understand ultimately as youve presented it why you want to move to the tight production capacity model does it nonetheless add risk to the system now that youre going to have operations that are so linked to the customer that perhaps there is a leverage risk down the road to your – youve hitched wagons to a larger degree with certain specific customers in the end markets and that could wind up being a problem just as the integration factors are behind you and i guess a related point tony and i mean this with all due respect obviously youve looked at lots of plastic acquisitions over the years and youve made the number if you are looking at your existing plastic packaging business clean slate of paper would you actually find it an attractive business to acquire from a silgan standpoint and why thanks guys ill turn it over anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good question so the first one is that as to the question getting closer to the customer and risk of that but first of all i do want to overstate the point we are not going through an all onsite model what were doing is getting a little more near site and onsite so its not binary in that regards secondly i would say that this is what silgan has done from its beginning you look most of our businesses and where we have great success were very near to customers and we serviced the hell out of and thats what were going to do in plastic business is were going to enhance the service aspect of what we do were going to get close to the right customers admittedly weve just stubbed our toe here on that and thats why were making the – taking care of customer at this moment so important and focus on it but longterm thats – we believe there is a great opportunity there and we can grow by doing that but again the idea is not all onsite near site its only that were open to that where it works with a certain select customer the second one is how would i view our business from the outside i think its – i would view it as unproven thus far i think – i can look around at where we do a good job on service again were talking about a couple of plants throwing us off – there are a lot of plants that are doing a great job right now and customers are being well serviced through that and i look at the team we have in place including the changes weve just made and i really do believe that we have the opportunity to be in much higher service model and customer support than others in the market so the answer to the question is i had looked but i would definitely – id be waiting to see the proof which i know we all are george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch thanks tony operator our next question comes from ghansham panjabi with robert w baird matthew t krueger  robert w baird  co inc broker hi this is actually matt krueger sitting in for ghansham how are you guys doing anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director hi matt robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer hi matt matthew t krueger  robert w baird  co inc broker right so my first question kind of revolves around some of the capital spending and free cash flow so how much total capital has been spent on the optimization efforts across the businesses and then do you have any update on free cash flow for  given all the moving pieces robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer yeah so the update on free cash flow maybe ill take them in reverse is that we reiterated approximately  million free cash flow so what youve got there is a little bit of a reduction in the profitability being offset by the timing of which capital gets spend so kind of moving from  into  aggregate total still kind of being pretty similar but moving some call it  million or so between the years – really between q and q in terms of the capital dollar spent on the programs the bulk of it is associated with the  million spend or so relative to the can plant and then youve got another  million in the plastics plant and then youve got some equipment rebuild that pales in comparison related to those other two pieces of costs matthew t krueger  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thats helpful and then can you guys provide a brief update on the current european market dynamics and kind of the pricing environment over in that region and then what are your european capacity utilization rates and do you foresee any need to add new capacity moving forward robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer sure as you know were primarily focused on kind of central europe to the eastern markets so i would say pricing has been a bit more stable over the last year or so although i would say relative to the broader market we probably havent seen anything outside of what the broader market is seeing some of that is nuanced by particular markets that were in so some better than others i think our capacity utilization is not constrained necessarily right now so that nearterm we dont necessarily see any broad need to build the incremental capacity in that marketplace so by all accounts from where we were a few years ago i think were feeling better about that business still think its got room to improve but certainly on the improvement side of the ledger matthew t krueger  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great then one more question and ill turn it over given the bpa nonintent seems to be gaining some momentum both in europe and in north america where are you in terms of the adoption of the technology across your product portfolio and then what commentary or feedback are you getting from customers regarding the bpa nonintent product anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director well weve been working on bpa nonintent coating for like eightplus years now we have done test packs over and over again of almost every package that we hold product that we hold so weve spent a lot of time on this mostly because we were concerned about kind of the consumer advocacy side i will spare you all that nothing has changed on the science here so youve got kind of a relatively small group of scientists who are pushing an agenda here and a lot of regulators who are saying theres – at the current levels that if theres a exposure theres not a lot to worry about nonetheless i think that consumer continues to hear more and more about it our view is that at some point in time the change is going to happen and so the answer is that we have solutions exist for most of our product lines there are definitely some vegetable soups that are – theyre more aggressive on the coatings that we still have a ways to go there im sure in time that will get resolved but that maybe shelf life is jeopardized i think it certainly will mean the robustness of the package is somewhat less than it was but the opportunity exists there today weve got if you look at our portfolio some  of it is pet cans so thats kind of not an issue at the bpa were probably another  of whats already converted and our view is probably next year another  of whats left there would get converted so probably by next year well be  in terms of whats bpa nonintent versus not and customers are all over the board on their view with this many are just waiting to see it play out because they see science arguments in the same way i just portrayed it some see it as we got to react to the consumers view on this and make changes and so its still over the board i would agree with you that the activity seems to be building a little bit certainly the french law has some impact on that prop  in california has some impact on that so were hearing more about it well do some conversions next year and it looks kind of like  by the end of the year including the pet food side operator our next question comes from debbie jones of deutsche bank debbie a jones  deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good morning debbie debbie a jones  deutsche bank securities inc i was wondering industry data this quarter there is a big shift from threepiece to twopiece and i think a lot of that is the new capacity thats come on but can you just talk about the trends that youre seeing in your business and you said there is kind of a bifurcation in how your customers feel about bpa but just maybe talk about how they feel about those two different can sizes or cans anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure what we have said before into the case is that with majority of what we make are some form of a twopiece can almost threequarters of what we make is a twopiece can so there is very little change in our system because whatever could be a twopiece can is a twopiece can there are some areas where its going to be threepiece because of the size requirements or other reasons for that so more or less what is in threepiece today is there for a reason and so there is not a real shift on that customers are not looking for a shift the reason it converted over time is it is a lower cost solution on twopiece but it does have some tradeoffs for certain applications so i dont see any big shift on that i think youre right the big – the main change is that you had a new twopiece line built in the us to service a particular customer who had been primarily serviced on threepiece that was a can that could make a change but there is not – in our system there is not a lot of cans that meet that description debbie a jones  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then my second question not to beat up on plastics but just  million you called out in volume is that something that was specifically related to the moves you were making or is that something that we should expect is lost and will not come back anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director its actually a couple of things one we see some continued weakness in certain markets that we serve and thats continued for the most part throughout the year and will continue in our expectation in q we also have gone out and secured volume for our customers in some cases weve also turned some business back to customers so a little bit of it is selfinflicted with our footprint rationalization as well but its a combination of both debbie a jones  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks ill turn it over anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director okay thanks operator our next question comes from anthony pettinari of citi anthony pettinari  citigroup global markets inc broker good morning just following up on plastic containers outside of the footprint optimization efforts which are internal are you seeing external pressures in any plastic container categories healthcare consumer et cetera or changes in competitive behavior that are impacting the business outside of some of the internal headwinds anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director no anthony not at all i think what we see is again the target markets that were intending to grow in are actually doing quite well there is some softness in other markets some of our household and ag chem businesses is a little bit softer but for the most part the target markets that were focused on are doing fine food healthcare personal care et cetera anthony pettinari  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful and then just following up on debbies question the  million in volumes in the segment is that business that was just where you saw volume decline or did you walk away from business because it became less attractive from a margin standpoint are you shedding volumes or if you can give any color there anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thats a good question its a combination of things because the answer for debbie was really versus our expectation so if you go back a step and talk about our portfolio rebalancing efforts that weve been doing in the last couple of years i think thats a – maybe a better answer for your question so we have left certain pieces of business back to the market because of the profitability of that business so part of our yeartoyear comparison is that weve rebalanced our portfolio another part is market softness in certain markets and then obviously by giving circulars back to customers theyve got out and secured that business elsewhere so it is a combination of kind of those three attributes anthony pettinari  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful ill turn it over operator our next question comes from scott gaffner of barclays scott louis gaffner  barclays capital inc thanks good morning anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good morning scott robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer good morning scott scott louis gaffner  barclays capital inc just following up couple of questions on the plastic container business can you talk a little bit about your competitive advantage within the segment i think you mentioned there was no other large high quality competitor but what is it that really makes you stand out there anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director i dont know that i said – i think what i said is that we dont think anybody has really nailed the service models that this market needs and i intentionally said – i didnt say other than us i believe its still open for many to grab well see who gets it so i think what we have said all along what we are very good at it is new product launch for almost any kind of package that you need in plastic bottle market weve got diverse technology types decorating capabilities et cetera so when youre trying to get a new product out launched et cetera weve got the right capabilities to get that done and thats been a really good opportunity for us but that becomes more and more of a service model the customers need it quicker they need it better they need certainty they need you to help them more because they got a lot on their agenda and so they need you to be bulletproof in providing that capacity and doing it in a very timely manner and we have to enhance ourselves there as well and so i was not trying to imply at all that we necessarily have that solved what i said is that i think weve got the right people in place and once were done here weve got the right assets in place that i believe we can do it scott louis gaffner  barclays capital inc okay and if i go back a few years well just now on this call you said you made some management changes within the plastics business did you make management changes a few years back i remember this business was having some margin difficulties then as well anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yes we did scott louis gaffner  barclays capital inc okay so i guess that – my question is more around than organizational support for this segment obviously metal food containers is a much larger piece of the total company and youre making optimization changes there as well how much of this do you think is current management change that you had to make within the segment versus maybe lack of support from the broader organization for the changes anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah i would not – i dont – my view is that its not the latter its not immediately clear i think what the broad organization could have done is insisted on a slower path here but that had its own tradeoffs so even on that its not clear to me that that would have been the right answer but thats probably the only thing in terms of support – lets remember this is a  million business its got full capability we have  people who have been in this business most of their careers so its not – even though it is not our largest business its not a flybynight operation they know what theyre trying to do and again i got to repeat we knew problems were going to come up we dont really know how to forecast them and budget them but we knew problems were going to come up these are worst than we thought it hit us a little quicker than we thought but this was – some level of this was inevitable in what were trying to accomplish and then finally management change i think really the key there is our view is that the changes we made will just make us that much stronger for the kind of customer service model that we want to get to scott louis gaffner  barclays capital inc okay fair enough last question a couple of people asked about the working – im sorry the capex shift in the  but when you think about the businesses there any significant changes to working capital maybe in the first half of  because of these slower shift to the new capacity or maybe even its lower because youre buying more in the outside market robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer yeah i think we kind of came into the year thinking that working capital was probably a little bit of a use of cash for the reasons that you just suggested kind of around managing the conversion here if anything that probably shifts a little bit to the first quarter but i dont see that as really being a meaningful change one way or the other scott louis gaffner  barclays capital inc okay thanks bob robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer you bet operator well go next to chip dillon with vertical research partners chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc hi yes good morning anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director hi chip chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc the first question is obviously from what youre saying youre going to be quite busy from pretty much the next year i think by this time next year a lot of this will have sorted itself out in both the plastics and container division but as you think about the next six months or so does the challenges of just making sure that a lot of these operations do get back to their correct footing where they need to be with all the changes does that make any difference in terms of your view toward ma at this point in terms of perhaps entering a different type of rigid business anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director no again we knew we were in that but i mean again the amount of work involved here is not a surprise to us so there is no news there i mean and again i dont want to make light of it we got were very focused on it but were in the business of focusing on a lot different things and different businesses who are always active in doing something so it does not change our view in that either way chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc okay so you still feel you have the same capacity as you always did to look at whats out there anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yes we do yeah and further were quite optimistic on the longterm for our businesses thats why were making these investments and i want to go further even in and say we feel while there may be bumps along the road that we are feeling what were doing we believe in and we believe that its a stronger business on the back end and that business will always have the opportunity to improve through the right ma which is how weve grown all along chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc got you i got you and maybe im simplifying this too much but it looks like both the third and the fourth quarters are about  less than maybe what we would have thought back in july and i guess you would verify that and then clarify that and then as we look at next year would you expect that rate of impact start to be reduced in the first quarter and then maybe down by more than half by the third quarter and pretty much go away by the fourth quarter next year im not trying to hold you that but im just saying is that roughly the pattern you would expect to see anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director first of all youre correct in your analysis so kind of  in the third quarter and  or  in the fourth quarter so that part is right and i would say one thing there is a little about the pack season in the food can business that affect that q so i mean thats not all incremental spend but the majority of it certainly is and i think the answer to that is that we are expecting a reasonable amount of continuation into q and q the only other point there is we have a little bit of cost around it in q in the food can business already in  so now youre going to cycle against a couple of million of those costs that were already in the comparative period chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc okay so maybe  to  in each of the first two quarters of next year roughly and then it starts to drop back anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thats correct yeah chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc well actually in the third quarter it might even go the other way right because you had that sort of full  impact this years third quarter and by next year the impact should be less so it actually might be a tailwind for you anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thats correct thats correct chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc okay i see all right thats very helpful thanks guys anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from mark wilde of bank of montreal mark wilde  bmo capital markets united states tony i hate to beat plastics to death but i just i got one more question here anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director fair enough mark wilde  bmo capital markets united states i think i heard you guys say earlier in the call that youd actually expected this sort of plastics restructuring to actually carry into  and now youre also talking about delaying kind of the nearterm moves a bit so what kind of headwind can we expect to be there yet in  for plastics anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah i wouldnt view it that way it is true that this program is going to take us into  for sure i mean again this is a pretty major footprint were working on thats not a surprise either we knew that that to finish this we have more still to do but i think what youre – right now youre going through a lot of excess costs more than we thought to deal with customer issues at some point we believe that its going to fade away as we get lines moved and stable again and so i think through  as adam said we expect that well see that fade away and yes its true that the comparison in the back half if that is what happens is helpful plus you start to get some savings and so i think as you get out into  youre going to get some of the savings what youve already done youre going to be sharing the incremental costs that youve been incurring and then youll be doing some other stuff that will create some of its own cost but the net of that ought to be helpful to us in  mark wilde  bmo capital markets united states okay all right i got it and then just in both plastics and metal by the time we get into  would you want to quantify about how much actual benefit were getting anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director well that we did when we started all this what we said is that were going to be getting kind of our  to  type returns on the capital that is being spent and that capital was some  million on plastic side and  millionish on the can side so thats kind of the magnitude of improvement we were out working on but i think again i want to – on the plastic side there is a lot more to it than that its the savings but its also kind of getting ourselves positioned for the future it was going to be a hard longterm answer for us for some of these plants given where they were or where the customers were mark wilde  bmo capital markets united states okay all right thats fair and just one last one if i could i think its been about four years or five years since you did vogel  noot and thats we havent a heard a lot about that it seems like its generated less leverage than you would have expected any lessons you take away from that one anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director when you say less leverage maybe ill come back to you but first of all i would say that that business was certainly it did very well at first then europe went through whatever europe has been going through and then we had a very rough patch so it was definitely disappointing to us lets say two years ago last year it actually came back quite a bit had a really good pack and in fact what we said is we didnt think we were going to be able to compete against that pack and in fact thats not true and the business is going to actually should improve itself just a bit this year fx is going to mitigate a lot of that but i would say that the big storyline of that business is its been pretty good for us we think its good for us to have exposure in those markets it think the big storyline there was growing into developing markets where we really believe that russia for example had a very sizeable markets that they were going to be and consumers et cetera clearly were much more cautious about that right now that doesnt mean were not watching it looking and then weve got two plants there but its pretty hard to say weve got this strategy now where were going to become the dominant player of russia and invest in five new plants that does mean as obvious so the strategic element of it is a little bit different but we got a really good team theyre very entrepreneurial they find ways to get it done and so we see it as a plus to the overall portfolio mark wilde  bmo capital markets united states okay thats really helpful tony good luck in the fourth quarter and good luck going into next year anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks you sure you dont want to talk about plastics anymore mark wilde  bmo capital markets united states its good operator our next question comes from alex ovshey of goldman sachs alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co good morning guys actually i have a few plastics ones for you anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director im happy with it alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co late in the call the two plant closures i may have missed that but i think those are – thats a new data point was that always in the cards or did something change in the quarter that precipitated the decision to close the two plants adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah those two plants have always been part of our overall program again it was a much broader multiyear program but the rationalization that we talked about in the press release those have been planned and implemented alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co got it adam and then just thinking about the end market exposure in the plastics business so the targeted markets personal care healthcare food can you say what the growth rates has been for you there and ultimately what percentage of the business that currently represents and over time where you see that number going to as you execute on this restructuring program anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure weve talked about – one of the two new plants is a new piece of business was a new food customer so there has been growth in there if you talk about the relative market these are low growth markets the foods market is pretty well grown and personal care is pretty well grown its more about position in that market and because silgan is such a sizeable food and packaging supplier across our portfolio of products we view that as a really good area where we can help the customer we can work closely with customers to forge longerterm solutions and so thats an area where we see growth opportunity on our own side but the market will be a couple of percent growth personal care is kind of at same level growth but again we were seeing very solid sales growth were slowing that a little bit while we go through the optimization program right now but we do see the opportunity a good sales force in place and if were successful in having service model that im describing to you well have a really good solution to sell alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co got it tony thank you ill turn it over operator well go next to george staphos of bank of america george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch hi guys a couple of – last question was on plastics just can you remind me the reimbursement impact in the third quarter what drove that and was that something you called out in the second quarter i dont recall thats question number one and then a question on level of competitive activity there but ill come back in a minute anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director on the customer reimbursement we called that out last year in q of  george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch oh thats right anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director so what that was it was a contractual obligation of payments for the reimbursement of kind of historical costs and the development of a new product that the customer ultimately decided not to take to market george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch thats right i do recall that sorry about that now i want to come back i think you were answering debbies question or maybe anthonys in terms of the volume factor so you said there were three components you said you rebalanced the portfolio and then you reintroduced some volume back to the market that was number two and then customers then found alternative supply did i get that all correctly anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay so whats the difference between the second and the third is it that because you reintroduced some volume back into your market the customers were affected chose to then find alternative supply for business that you already had and wanted to keep but they wound up moving elsewhere anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director that is correct yes george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay so i mean again not to be pedantic but isnt that a sign of maybe competitive activity being more intense and if not why not anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director no i dont think so i think this is us identifying the challenges that we were facing and going proactively to our customers saying this is going to be a problem for you and in order for us to again help protect our customers from the challenges that were facing weve asked them to go out and secure the other business so i dont view it as a competitive activity at all this is just us doing our best to protect our customers george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay even though it was some piece of business you would have wanted to keep if you could have anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thats what im sure george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay all right adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president its just us knowing that were going to hurt the customer if we dont give them room to go solve the problem george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay fair enough thanks for the clarification there then last thing can you update us on what you think the cash impact of all the rationalization and realignment is going to be this year and what you think the cash im not talking about capital expense now im talking more about people cost and the like what it will be in  thank you guys and good luck in the quarter robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer yeah so george there is roughly  million of rationalization charges that weve recorded the majority of that in both plants and plastics are equipment writedowns so noncash there is about – so leaving about  million of cash charges for that that kind of comes in two big slugs there is a lease that will be ongoing over a period of time that will capture some of that and then there is the severance payments that will be paid out to the folks that are let go george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director and then i think weve said when we – in the metal food can side we said when we announce the new line that there could be another – we estimated  million of spend as we get to shutting down some capacity george l staphos  bank of americamerrill lynch okay thank you very much anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer thanks george operator well go next to adam josephson of keybanc adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks for taking my followups i appreciate it just one more on next year just to make sure im just correct on these incremental costs you talked about plastics cost being flattish next year compared to this year i think metal can you said might be  million lower or so is that correct roughly robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer yeah thats what ive said but dont forget what i said on the metal food can side that i dont have that exact number we havent really done that adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc sure robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer but yes that is the guess that we made yes adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc and just aside from that tony and rob anything aside from uses of cash any notable items next year that might move the needle tax rate interest anything else robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer pension maybe is the only one that i would point out as being probably still unknown at this point right because we got to wait till the end of the year to see what the discount rate is and i think its anybodys guess as to what direction thats going right now i think the underlying feeling right now is that pension expense is probably a bit of a headwind for us next year largely because asset performance this year hasnt been what we would have expected and thats been true across the markets i dont think were unique in that case order of magnitude could be call it  million to  million so still income but less income adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc got it thanks bob and just tony one last one just in terms of managing the business youre obviously in the three business lines in numerous geographies has the business gotten any more difficult to manage than it was say five years to  years ago anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director well its a good question certainly as we went international that added a scope to it beyond that i dont really think so i think it is good to remember kind of how silgan manages right we run a holding company weve got very complete management teams in each of our businesses so we have the luxury here where we dont have to sweat the daytoday details we can think more strategic we can certainly stay involved with the important points that are happening so i think our structure is perfectly suited for increased complexity as we go forward so yeah to the extent it has i think were very well structured to deal with that i dont think there is anything about that and whats going on right now the plastic issue that were facing as we said was going to come up in some form in any case its a little more expensive than we thought but i dont attribute that to the fact that weve got more complexity and more issues to deal with adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks a lot tony best of luck anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director you bet operator we have no other questions at this time id like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks anthony j allott  president chief executive officer

actual results of operations or financial condition of the company could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements with that ill turn it over to tony anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thank you kim welcome everyone to our second quarter  earnings conference call our agenda for the morning will focus on the financial performance for the second quarter and then a review of our outlook for  after our prepared remarks bob adam and i will be pleased to answer any questions as you saw in the press release we delivered second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of  right in line with our expectations this was slightly behind our  adjusted earnings per diluted share in the comparable quarter of  as each of our businesses were impacted by inefficiencies and incremental costs from their separate footprint optimization programs our metal container business delivered  volume improvement as a result of new business associated with the van can acquisition an earlier start to the midwest vegetable pack and solid volumes in the european business were pleased with this growth in the metal container business and are focused on meeting the increased demand requirements from our existing infrastructure this year while at the same time working to better align our geographic footprint and reduce the cost of the recently acquired van can supply to more profitably service this business in the future our closures business which successfully integrated portola packaging last year has shifted the moving production assets to shared facilities as a result the business will be better prepared to service national customers with our diverse product lines on a more efficient geographic basis progress already made on this effort allowed us to reduce our inventory levels resulting in temporary lower cost absorption during the quarter our plastic container business continues to implement a footprint realignment and optimization plan intended to enhance our competitive position in the longterm and partly mitigate significant price reductions on recent customer contract renewals in the nearterm while the initial timeline of these programs now appears aggressive progress is being achieved on these efforts results in the quarter were further compounded by continued softness in several of our end markets based on our yeartodate performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year were confirming our fullyear estimate of adjusted earnings per share in the range of  to  with that ill now turn over to bob to review the financial results in a bit more detail and provide additional explanation around our earnings estimates for  robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer thank you tony good morning everyone as tony highlighted we delivered quarterly results very much in line with our expectations as we discussed on previous calls  is expected to be a transition year across all three of our businesses and there is no doubt we felt the effects of that transition in the second quarter on a consolidated basis net sales for the second quarter of  were  million a decline of  million as decreases in the closure and plastic container businesses due partly to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency were partially offset by increased sales in the metal container business net income for the second quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to second quarter of  net income of  million or  per diluted share results for  included rationalization charges of  million for total increase of adjusted earnings per share of  while results for  included rationalization charges of  and a loss in venezuela of  million for a total increase of adjusted earnings per share of  as a result we delivered adjusted income per diluted share of  in  versus  in  interest and other debt expense decreased  million to  million for the quarter primarily as a result of lower weighted average borrowing rates lower average outstanding borrowings and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation capital expenditures for the second quarter of  totaled  million compared with  million in the prior year quarter yeartodate capital expenditures totaled  million versus  million in the prior year additionally we paid a quarterly dividend of  per share in june with a total cash cost of  million and repurchased shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of  million share repurchases on a yeartodate basis were  million ill now provide some specifics regarding each of the financial performances of our businesses the metal container business recorded net sales of  million for the second quarter of  an increase of  million or  versus the prior year quarter this increase is primarily a result of  higher unit volumes partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency of  million volumes were higher yearoveryear as a result of incremental us volumes associated with the van can acquisition and an earlier start to the midwest vegetable pack and europe also had stronger volumes income from operations in the metal container business was  million for the second quarter  versus  million in the same period a year ago the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher manufacturing cost due largely to logistical challenges from changes in customer demand patterns the inclusion of less efficient van can operations and a less favorable mix of products sold partially offset by the higher volumes net sales in the closures business decreased  million to  million for the quarter primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of  million and the passthrough of lower resin costs partially offset by a  improvement in unit volumes income from operations in the closures business for the second quarter of  was  million down  million versus the prior year quarter this reduction was primarily the result of unfavorable foreign currency translation and a reduction in inventory during the second quarter of  partially offset by the second quarter  operational loss of  million in venezuela and higher unit volumes the second quarter  inventory reduction is a result of returning to a more normal inventory level after building inventory in the second quarter of  to facilitate the portola integration net sales in the plastic container business were  million for the second quarter of  down  million versus the prior year quarter this decrease was largely due to the passthrough of lower raw material costs the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of  million the unfavorable impact from recent longerterm customer contract renewals and a  decline in volumes due to weaker demand in certain end markets operating income decreased  million to  million for the second quarter of  this decrease was primarily related to the unfavorable impact from recent longerterm customer contract renewals as well as the delayed implementation of certain mitigating cost reduction programs manufacturing inefficiencies associated with planned equipment moves and new business awards lower volumes and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation turning now to our outlook for  based on our yeartodate performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year we are confirming our estimate of adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of  to  per share which excludes the impact from certain adjustments outlined in table b of our press release were also providing third quarter of  estimate of adjusted earnings in the range of  to  per diluted share as weve discussed in the past given the magnitude of the third quarter and the potential impact of unforecasted movements in harvest dates the earnings in the back half of the year can shift meaningfully between q and q consistent with prior guidance we continue to forecast free cash flow generation to be approximately  million largely a result of the incremental capital spending across the various footprint optimization programs throughout the businesses along with the construction of the three new facilities that concludes our prepared comments so we can open it up for qa and ill turn it back to jennifer who can provide directions for the qa session questionandanswer session operator yes well go first to chris manuel with wells fargo christopher d manuel  wells fargo securities llc good morning gentlemen anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good morning chris christopher d manuel  wells fargo securities llc just a couple of questions let me start with the metal food business sounds like it did really really well pulled some volume ahead could you maybe give us a sense i mean as you look at the full year or you think about what happened in q in the big picture is that essentially what happened some of the volume was more or less pulled ahead that will kind of come at the expense of q and q or do you feel that the situation created earlier crops better weather what have you improved situation somewhat or how would you think about that anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director hey chris its tony we certainly are expecting to have up volumes for the year so i would not say everything about the quarter was just about pull ahead it does appear that we got in the vegetable pack the midwest got off to an early start youll also recall last year we talked about one customer who was not promoting as hard so that customer seems to be doing exactly what they said which is getting back to promotion and filling at a higher rate so you kind of have those two impacts which look like pull ahead but you also have all the business associated with van can acquisition thats coming in and will be additive for the year so the answer is sort of a hybrid yes there is a pull ahead yes there is some chance some of it will come out of q in fact most surely will our estimate for the rest of the year does assume a pretty good pack so again we are expecting solid numbers from the pack everything indicates that way ill wait for the followup question on that to get in detail on the pack but i think that rounds out your question christopher d manuel  wells fargo securities llc yeah and i mean so fullyear what are you anticipating for volumes i guess thats inclusive of van can and then if maybe you could give us a little color too on europe anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure i think i said if youre staying in cans we are expecting up kind of midish singledigit volumes in the food can business that does include europe as well in that number europe was strong yeartodate we continue to see what looks to be a pretty good growing season in europe so our expectation right now is to be comparable or up a bit from what was a very strong pack year last year christopher d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful my followup question is it pertains to the plastics unit it sounds like maybe you had some plans to some of the relocation stuff that proved to be a bit aggressive could you maybe give us a little more color there as to whats changed whats pushed back is it changing any of the opportunity that you think youll have how much for extra cost or things associated in the quarter that kind of stuff adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president hey chris its adam looking at our plastics business and the optimization plans that we had in place the one important thing to remember is that theres not a lot of new capacity going into these optimization plans so we are taking our best assets that exist in the network for the most part and getting them located in our lowest cost facilities and closer to our customers so you are talking about moving existing equipment that has business thats already booked on it and is also in the process of commercializing new business awards that weve won as well so that being said really the primary focus of the business right now is servicing those customers both existing customers and the ones that weve won new business with and so versus where that is part of the delay and moving the lines as we are making sure that were fulfilling all of our commitments to our customers off of that equipment so really thats the biggest part for the delay is that weve just continued to have challenges and finding the time if you will to move those lines and so you are correct its delayed versus where we thought we still think were on the right path we still think we have the right plans as far as the two new operating facilities that are being built and well get to the footprint that we had originally designed christopher d manuel  wells fargo securities llc all right is there a way that you can quantify for us i mean i see total volumes down  but it sounds like you are winning good chunks of business and im sure there is some ebb and flow some things you kind of let go some things come in or a natural move is there a way to kind of give us a sense of how the commercial teams are doing winning new business is it going along the path youd hoped we were kind of looking for over the next year or two some kind of chunk improvements there in volume but how would you characterize for us the commercialization efforts adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure what i would say number one again were experiencing some soft market demand from our organic business so it is putting a damper on the new business awards as we commercialize them but i would say that were having good success were implementing the plan from a new business standpoint that we identified early on activity levels remain very good as far as quoting and actually getting those new business awards so were securing business and the timing of that commercialization varies really depending upon the market and the customer but i would say that were doing a pretty good job commercially its just we havent been able to offset the softness in the market that weve seen organically christopher d manuel  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks chris operator well go next to adam josephson with keybanc capital markets adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks good morning tony bob and adam hope youre doing well one on the supply chain inefficiencies in the metal container business bob can you quantify what the ebit drag was out of the total yearonyear drag of  million i think it was robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer yeah so i think were thinking that the inefficiencies across the broader part of the year is going to be somewhere in the  million to  million range and so you might expect that were early into that were feeling the effects particularly in one of the lower quarters so its kind of right in line i would call it in the  million range adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc got it anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director this is tony i just want to add one thing just having kind of looked at the notes out this morning i think just to be clear that number bob just gave you was a number we gave right out of the box when we started this year there is really no surprise to us in this its not a case of our operations not performing or anything else literally its a footprint challenge that we knew we had coming into the year as customers moved their fill and so basically its played out almost exactly as we expected thus far adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks tony i appreciate that one other one on the us food can business how would you characterize pricing at the moment anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director again recall that were  under contract where we went through over the last year to two we did a lot of new contracts because of the investments we were making around can vision  so to us there is no market movement and price to speak of but beyond that i wouldnt say there is anything unusual in the market around that so i would call it stable passing through our raw material costs as youd expect and nothing new there adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks tony just two others bob one just housekeeping question tax rate and interest for the year robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer sure the tax rate as you saw the tax rate is a bit lower in the quarter than the prior year came in at about  so were expecting the fullyear to probably be in the neighborhood of  plus a little bit and the primary drivers there around the lower rate are – we had a positive impact of having higher profits in lower tax jurisdictions which benefited the rate and then we also had a rate change related to some of the certain international financings which benefited the rate as well embedded in there there is a small catchup in the quarter for that rate change but as youll see in the fullyear rate these are recurring tax benefits so were expecting the rate to now be lower on a yearoveryear basis adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks interest expense robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer sure on the interest side i think the primary driver basically is unchanged from where we had talked about in the prior quarters other than the fact that you had a benefit hit on the interest line for fx and thats really only partially offsetting about a  million hit on the ebit line that sits throughout the rest of the businesses so the net fx impact is about  and thats pretty well right in line with what we had talked about in the last quarter when we adjusted our guidance for the fx impact adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc that helps a lot bob thanks and just one last one on the tender your shares are trading below the low end of the tender range obviously when the tender happened the tender priced at the highend now theyre below the lowend and i think if i look at the last couple of tenders the shares went right through the highend and kept marching up so this seems to be different than previous instances are you at all surprised by whats happened in that regard robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer yeah i mean look our business is not to focus on what the stock market reaction is we kind of looked at this as just exactly what it was a return of capital and it was up to the shareholders to make their own decision as to whether they wanted that return or whether they saw value in the equity i think were happy with the way the business is performing and we see longterm value created so ill leave it at that and not pass judgment on where people make their decisions adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc got it thanks a lot bob appreciate it operator well go next to george staphos with bank of america george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch hi everyone good morning thanks for all the details i want to maybe start off in plastics tony bob and adam you went through a number of qualitative description in terms of whats happening in the market and why some of these initiatives are maybe being delayed somewhat i guess to start i would ask if you had to index the market right now versus what you would see as normal demand where would you see it for your end market is it a  if  is normal is it  could you help us understand where the market is relative to what you would like to see or normally expect to see and in turn is there a way to quantify how that might be having an effect on your delays and any of your cost mitigation efforts or if thats a totally separate subject thanks and ill have a few others adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president okay thanks george its adam i guess if were trying to index the demand in our plastics business i would say its probably roughly around a  out of a  in my opinion i think whats happened george is as we rebalance our portfolio and bring in these new business awards it does create a little bit of complication to our system and so were not as efficient as you are when youre up and running commercial products and youve got cutins and startups associated with the new businesses but to quantify that is pretty difficult but it is a result of lower absorption because the volume is down and we are running less efficiently because we are qualifying new products so as we go forward the footprint optimization really isnt impacted by that to a large degree simply because that is a longer term plan that we have that really gets the business back to a competitively advantaged position in the marketplace so we do have a shortterm issue with our volume with the delayed implementation of the cost mitigation efforts for the price concessions that we gave but we do think that were on the right path and that we will look to be at that run rate as we head into  at this point george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch okay two questions one if i would just on the level of market demand relative to what complications it may or may not be bringing into the operating issue for the plastics business i would imagine that if demand is substandard in the market that maybe gives you more flexibility to do the operating work right because you have less demand on your existing capacity from your various end markets so would that not help your ability if demand is slower in the market to get these projects done and then i may have missed it and i apologize if i did where specifically – what are the sources for the delays in the cost mitigation effort initiatives adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president okay so back to market demand george i think the important thing to realize there is that we service many different markets and have different customers and plants all over the country so unfortunately the target markets that we are focused on are doing fairly well from a demand standpoint thats also where were growing and getting new business awards so you got the kind of complicating factor that your busiest lines your busiest plants are also experiencing heavy volume of new business awards because theyre the markets that we are focused on and that we are attempting to implement our growth strategy on so that is part of the complication so it doesnt necessarily benefit us that the market softness in the plastics market in general to qualify additional new business because where we see softness is not necessarily where were growing george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch understood anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director and if you look at the delays in the mitigation it falls right into it right because those are the very same lines that were looking to move and relocate and optimize and get our best assets and our lowest cost plants closest to our customers those are the lines that were running  and that we are trying to optimize right now so its been a complicating factor but i think when you get into it by customer by market segment it does add a little clarity george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch thats fair two quickies on metal and ill turn it over could you provide if possible what the organic ie excluding van can volumes were for metal on a yearonyear basis in the quarter and then when i looked at the revenue percentage changes – i did my own based on what you said for fx i came up with roughly about a percentage point or so remaining gap to the negative was that passthrough of steel i know you said i think to adams question there has been no change in pricing but was there any price erosion that was beyond passthrough or was there another issue there thanks guys ill turn it over anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks george yeah so on the growth we had  growth the number one contributor to that was the addition of new businesses associated with van can acquisition so that was less than half but the largest component the next largest component was the pack business coming in and then finally you had europe being the third in that so that gives you kind of a bit of a scaling on that so you did have the organic growth that comes from both europe and from the pack those two in combination are greater than half of that increase george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful thank you tony anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director some of that pulled forward the margin question i think that the other biggest point on margin is now recall that van can and associate business what weve said is we bought a business that was losing money that our plan was and continues to be to improve the profitability of those plants that we brought on bring in new assets new skill sets et cetera and thats exactly we intend to do so one of the biggest pieces of the volume gain is basically add no profit so thats the rest of kind of your margin answer sorry that plus all of the logistical elements that we talked about so you got high freight costs high warehouse costs youre moving a lot of product around youre not necessarily making the most efficient location because you cant thats not where the customer needs it so you got those two points that are sitting on the margin as well george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch but i apologize i was referring to revenue so theres a point to the negative on revenue was that passthrough of steel if i adjust for currency and what you said volume was anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah no all that is is that the mix of the products of van can and associate are much lower price point product theyre not our average so george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch okay anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thats what we would call a mix point george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch understood thank you anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director great thanks george operator well go next to chip dillon with vertical research partners chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc yes thank you very much and good morning tony and bob anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director hi chip chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc first question is on some of the overseas operations i know i think you have what two plants i think or several in russia ukraine and jordan and with all the – i know we havent heard much about russia and ukraine in the last six months have things started to maybe improve slowly there or are we still sort of in the same mode as we were back when the tensions were higher anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure i think the answer is shortly it depends upon which market youre talking about i think as to the ukraine its still a pretty difficult market i think as weve talked about in the past that plant was cited to export into russia and thats obviously not happening to the degree that we would have wanted it to when we cited the plant there so there is very little activity thats happening in that plant right now so thats a little bit of a drag for us the russian plants are actually from a volume perspective doing pretty nicely they saw pretty good pack volumes they had an early p  pack there i think everything that the growers can grow and pack there theyre doing so so the volumes are pretty good i think the caution remains and weve been at this for a while now trying to mitigate a lot of the risk here is around whats going to happen to the economy what kind of liquidity exists there so just to remind you we did index all of our contracts over there into euro to mitigate exposure to the ruble which has been done and the market is still operating that way weve kind of indexed our customers on a credit worthiness basis and were being very prudent about what kind of credit were extending to customers only the very top tier customers are getting extended credit others are being serviced but serviced either cash in advance or cash on delivery so more of the same and the team that we have on the ground over there is paying close attention so i would say were cautiously optimistic given the volume outlook in russia but doing everything we can to mitigate the risk on a goforward basis chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc okay and in jordan anything remarkable there good or bad or is that sort of steady as it goes anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah well steady for that part of the world is all relative right but i think were seeing decent volume there as more and more filling capacity came into jordan to service the broader middle east so thats doing okay from time to time as the fighting gets closure to the various borders we may see temporary shutdowns in terms of our freight lanes and so we experienced some of that but overall that business seems to be doing very good relative to where it was a year or two ago which is basically had no volume at that point chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc okay and then just as a followup i know you mentioned the  million to  million i guess headwind you have this year in the plastics business given all the moving parts do you think youll get pretty much all of that back next year or will it take a while to sort of get everything worked out and maybe you wont see it all back until  but if you could just clarify that and then secondly if i think about what youre doing in food can so i know thats still in progress if we assume metal prices stayed flat do you think the unit cost of the whole business would actually decline next year even though you would expect maybe a couple percent inflation with wages and other costs anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think just to clarify the point and probably both now sort of related here but the  million to  million headwind that we referenced is in the containers business not in the plastics business chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc oh im sorry anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director so – so that – we will experience that through the year i think the thinking right now is that well kind of get – as the plants come up and running well start to mitigate that in the early part of  and well be at the full run rate recovery of that by the time we get to the end of  so i think all of that leads me to think that yeah youre right on the second point that that will have impact on the overall cost structure of the business or on the unit cost chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc but – and of course you will get more than that i would think right that we would see over time that – so you get the  million to  million back and then you get the other improvements that youre looking at anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director over the longerterm and then what weve said there is that we would expect that the return profile of this project would be kind of in the normal  to  kind of range on a return basis adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president so long as we understand there is a little bit of overlap on those two topics so some of those costs were experiencing we knew we had embedded in our system that helped drive the investment for the plant not all of them but some of them see its not a perfect two discrete points there is some of the project thats justified and mitigating some of those costs that we had to take on chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc okay understood understood and lastly could you just remind us some – i know earlier in the companys life as you were i guess growing more rapidly with acquisitions you were willing to run your leverage up although you were always quick to pay it down could you just – given your footprint and your current business mix if there were opportunities that were larger that came down the road how do you think about your balance sheet in this day and age and sort of how much debt would you incur until you would start thinking about equity to top that up if again assuming hypothetically an opportunity were available anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah sure i think weve been pretty consistent for quite some time now saying that we thought the kind of the normalized run rate for leverage for us the goalpost if you will are kind of  times to  times yearend net debt to ebitda leverage so i dont think there is much changed about that in terms of how we think about longer term but for the right opportunity we certainly would consider leveraging beyond the  times id point you back to  when we looked at the large transaction in that year we would have taken the leverage to up  times  times or so i think all of that really depends upon what the cash flow generation profile of the pro forma business looks like and if it gives us the opportunity to come back in line to that  time to  time metric in a relatively short period of time wed be happy to do it i think in terms of the where the bright line is between where we debt finance and equity finance i think it all depends upon what the impact to the overall costofdebt is with the leverage and appetite to the lending community so its a more difficult one to answer other than to say that weve – of all the deals weve done weve not done an equity deal that one deal in  that i referenced would have had an equity component to it so its not something that we were opposed to it just would take a deal of significant size to probably drive us there chip a dillon  vertical research partners llc okay very helpful thank you anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks chip operator well go next to ghansham punjabi with baird ghansham panjabi  robert w baird  co inc broker hey guys good morning anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good morning ghansham ghansham panjabi  robert w baird  co inc broker i guess first off post the footprint optimization what do you think your incremental margins would be for each of your operating segments would it be greater than what you had maybe five years ago or is it basically getting you back to those levels anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director well it depends by business of course i think in the containers business the metal can business our expectation would be to kind of get back to where we were a couple of years prior recognize of course that with our passthrough of raw materials all of this is a little hard to answer but that would be the basic concept there in the plastics side ultimately our goal is to improve where we were if you go back to that time period and we would view success as getting back to where we were much further back and i – and weve talked about this before that its going to be – i think what wed like to do is get back to the five year ago in the next few years and if we can get back to where we were a decade ago somewhat longer period than that that may take us really growing into some of these target markets et cetera finishing getting this footprint costs down probably making some more investment in new footprint behind new customers so those will be our expectations i think the closures business will be the most gradual of all of those partly because what weve done was pretty gradual this year its not major changes to the footprint we already got the portola – the lions share of the portola benefit was already in the numbers from last year so i would say of the three that would be the most gradual ghansham panjabi  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thats really helpful and then just in terms of sort of secular demand for metal food cans target on the retail side announced deemphasizing the metal soup cans earlier this year do you sort of view that as a oneoff retailer specific move or do you sense that there is a broader push amongst the retailers to change their package bags anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director well i think there is a broader push among retailers to focus – and i should say a broader interest among end users to eat more healthy products and so i think that the retailers are just reacting to that theyre trying to put things on the shelf that are perceived as being healthier et cetera and i think in some cases youre seeing that soup being a good example of that where that moves a little away from the big brands that we supply moves to smaller regional players in some cases i think the answer to your question is going to depend on how our customers view with that challenge and thats kind of what theyre all about working on right now i think that whats interesting is that soup as an example is such a great health product there is nothing about the can that is detrimental to that fact and the can is able to deliver that food product at so much lower cost basis than any other package can that our own view on this is that there is going to need to be a drive to explain to the consumers the value of soup which younger consumers dont really understand to work in any kind of package type you can to win that consumer group back in and then we think that there will be a logical next step to that which is to bring it all back towards canned because thats the lowest cost solution and thats the best infrastructure solution for our major customers but thats – so thats going to take some time the short term of that is definitely there is a drive towards what are perceived as healthier foods but again our customers can right now come out with and do have organic products and there is not – again there is nothing about their process or their packaging that is any less healthy than what those retailers are asking for on the shelves ghansham panjabi  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks so much guys anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yeah operator well go next to anthony pettinari with citi anthony pettinari  citigroup global markets inc broker good morning anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good morning anthony pettinari  citigroup global markets inc broker just following up on chips question on europe i believe you have two facilities in greece are those selling exclusively to greek customers or are those cans moving around europe or did you see any impact in the quarter there anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure youre right we do have two operating facilities in greece the primary markets that were supplying over there are for feta cheese olive oil and peaches which each of those products are largely exported out of the country so as weve discussed weve been taking precautionary measures for some time just around the perceived risk and now maybe the real risk that resides there including very early on we were communicating with our customers that regardless of what currency greece itself moved to our agreements were euro based weve been very selective on any credit that weve extended otherwise we didnt pay either in advance or on delivery were also being very careful as to how much cash we accumulate in greece so were holding very minimal cash balances there weve also just to help manage costs weve taken some down time in the plants during the peak of the crisis so as a consequence the current outlook is that the growing season is actually looking pretty good particularly for peaches and were expecting a strong pack so were kind of balancing that the net of it is that we havent seen any real negative impact in the quarter largely because we took some downtime in the quarter to mitigate cost and were expecting that if it settles down and i think our view is that theres a long way to go before we can say it settled down that well take it as it comes but no meaningful negative impact right now anthony pettinari  citigroup global markets inc broker okay okay thats helpful and then just switching to plastics last quarter i think you indicated that the pennsylvania facility will be operational this quarter and that the hazelwood facility would be kind of at the end of the year are those timelines still intact and does the kind of volume weakness that you referenced in your earlier comments does that at all impact the timeline for bringing those two facilities online adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president well as far as the timing of those facilities the northeast pennsylvania plant will be operational in q so its in the process of coming up to speed as we speak the missouri facility will be towards the end of the year so we are expecting that still on track in q and as far as having the market softness impacting those facilities coming up what i would say a little bit of the same answer i gave a few minutes ago is just that those new facilities in large part are dependent upon equipment moves of existing assets from other facilities so again right now were really focused on servicing our customers and making sure they get the products that they need and so we had a little bit of a delay in again the cost out programs but those lines are coming from other plants for the most part but for those specific facilities we anticipate that well be on our original time schedule and again northeast pa in q and st louis in q anthony pettinari  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful ill turn it over operator well go next to anojja shah with bmo capital markets anojja shah  bmo capital markets united states hi its anojja shah from mark wildes team at bmo i just wanted to talk about the plastic containers  volume decline can you give any additional color on specific product categories or customer types where you saw weakness anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure its largely in our organic business and i would say its spread somewhat across our food our personal care and then our distribution markets and distribution is a difficult one to really quantify because it does serve so many of the end markets that our products go into but really food personal care were the two biggest for us at silgan anojja shah  bmo capital markets united states okay thats helpful thank you and could we talk about the impact of resin in q and then your expectations for resin in q robert b lewis  executive vice president  chief financial officer sure q resin really did not have much of an impact either comparatively to prior year or versus q prices were relatively stable and declined at a similar rate as they did in the prior year as we go forward were expecting relatively flat resin for q so again no bottom line impact i think the important note here is the impact will be on the revenue side it was on the revenue side in q as we look at prior year it will also impact q on the revenue side as we continue to pass through the lower resin cost that we are experiencing in the market and primary resins are down doubledigit percent versus prior year so again thats just being passedthrough on the bottom line to our customers but it is impacting our revenue line anojja shah  bmo capital markets united states right okay thank you and then just maybe you can give us an update on what youre seeing on the ma front are you seeing lots of properties available and maybe what peoples value expectations are anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director sure its no question that ma continues to be an important part of the strategy we continue to look at all opportunities that are out there and do keep an active pipeline i think there are a few deals in the market that could be of some interest as we said in the past valuations expectations are pretty high particularly given the low cost of debt but again we focus on cash on cash returns around the ma front as well but i would say more broadly as we kind of come through the summer here its feeling a bit like the ma environment has experienced a typical summer lull if you will so while there is a few out there it doesnt seem to be as active as it was maybe six or  months ago anojja shah  bmo capital markets united states okay interesting all right thats it from me thank you very much anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator well go next to alex ovshey with goldman sachs alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co thank you how are you guys anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director good alex adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president hi alex alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co couple of questions just going back to plastics and the volume weakness how do you explain why its soft in the us i mean the consumer really isnt humming per se but at the same time it does sound like things should be pretty steady and so why should that business continue to decline in this kind of  to  rate how do you explain that adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president well again i mean part of the explanation is that weve been going through this portfolio rebalancing effort for the last year and a half now and that continues were cycling in and out of business all the time and so there is a good component of our market softness that is associated with our rebalancing efforts as well but really id say we dont see the general uptick in demand for our plastic products in the marketplace and it may just be a counter trend to the broader economy but thats our experience alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co okay okay got it adam and then in terms of the new business when that does really start to come in i mean is there any way to quantify in terms of how much revenue that will ultimately add to the segment once you really onboard the new business wins that should make the difference thatll make a real difference in the business adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure i mean again its an ongoing process right again there is always new business coming in and some business exiting at the same time but i think i probably answer that a little bit as tony talked about the returns and profitability of the business i think our expectation is youll see that hitting the bottom line and that is where will be most quantifiable on a goforward basis as we return to historical credit  margin rates over the medium term alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co okay got it and now can you talk about how the shelfstable plastic business that you acquired from rexam is performing adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure it continues to perform very well right in line with expectations not only when we made the acquisition but postacquisition as well theyve done an excellent job with new business awards in the us for again the high barrier shelfstable packaging and continue to grow the business at a nice pace for that size business both in the us and weve got good prospects outside of the us but we havent had that great kind of growth prospect outside of the us at this point so we were never really planning on that as a major part of that acquisition we were focused on running the business and continuing to deliver the business as it was performing so its right in line with expectations alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co got it so bottom line its not a source of weakness its really performing the way you hoped for adam j greenlee  chief operating officer  executive vice president not a source of weakness no alex ovshey  goldman sachs  co excellent thank you very much ill turn it over operator well go next to george staphos with bank of america george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch thanks very much tony or adam i just want to go back to plastics one last time so tony i heard you say youd like to get back to the margins of five years ago and that might take two years to three years and correct me where im incorrectly paraphrasing and i think you said to go back to the margins of  years ago would take more time and would take the company being able to grow in some of these target markets as you expect and wish to could you remind us because i dont recall what would you specifically like to see recognizing that resin is going to swing quite a bit and will change percentage margins what ultimately margin target would you like investor to have in mind for the plastics business over the next three years and if i go back to the s you were doing well over  operating margins i think those are a little bit far off so help us again framing what we should be thinking about at least given your view of the world anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director yes i think youve actually paraphrased that pretty well i think the  is kind of the number wed really like to see ourselves get to and i think what adam said is right there is a component of – its really return on capital because what we have to spend to get there and does that make sense but with all that said i believe that the business if we can do what we believe were on the path to doing which is to really have a differentiating capability in terms of brining out new products new innovation for customers if we can do that then i believe that kind of a operating profit level is achievable and thats sort of what wed like to get ourselves to george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch and that would be within the next call it three years assuming everything else comes together and assuming obviously we hold return on capital or we dont deal with the return on capital issue here because obviously you could do anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director i might put that out just a little bit further i think that kind of that  mark is a little bit more aspirational that its going to be more in that kind of fiveyear timeframe i think well be moving ourselves towards that over the course of next three years or so but i would say more as a kind of an end point again ive got to caveat it second time that it really is about returns on capital because if something came along with lower margin but we didnt have to pay a lot for it we would immediately buy that drive our margins rate back down george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch sure anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director as long as the return on capital was good george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch one last quickie for me just the normal swing factors for the rest of the year and the guidance range of  million to  million im assuming its almost entirely harvest but is there anything else that we should be considering as a risk or positive risk factor for that matter for the rest of the year thanks guys good luck in the quarter anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks george yes i would just say what we i think said at the beginning of this year which is weve got a lot of balls in the air right every business is moving a lot of assets around building so i would just say that more than a typical year weve got a lot of activities going on and so i think the number one thing is that all of those stay within a range of what we believe ought to happen right so weve built in some cushion around that but whether we have enough or not will probably be the biggest risk we have for the remainder of the year i think the pack is kind of interesting one first of all we have a fairly high number assumed in for the pack secondly because of logistical challenge even if the pack surged way over top this year more than any year that might not drop down much profit at all because the inefficiency it would take for us to kind of keep up with that so i think there is very little upside on the pack in any case downside is a different matter so obviously you have always a bit of a downside with the pack those are the big moving pieces and then the last caveat is certainly the pack season can shift q to q and so we have our normal volatility between those quarters george l staphos  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks ill turn it over anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks george operator and well go next to adam josephson with keybanc capital markets adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks tony i appreciate it just one follow up on pet food and soup were there any particular surprises in the quarter in terms of either pet food or soup i ask partly because the largest soup company just lowered its longterm sales growth forecast this morning just to reflect current food industry conditions and i was just thinking longer term you think growth in pet food will roughly offset declines in soup such that those two components will average out to be kind of flattish and then youve got fruit and veggie which is kind of flattish as well thanks very much anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director i think what you just said there adam is about right which is that i think we do expect that pet will continue to grow as it has been so what you just described is pretty much whats happened for the last five or more years for us i think soup has been in decline for a period of time that is probably our expectation at this point that all fits with what i think the customer youre referring to has recently said but as i mentioned earlier i am somewhat hopeful i think soup has got an interesting challenge and an interesting opportunity and well have to watch to see how our customers manage their way through that but i do see the potential for upside in soup it is a great healthy product that is being somewhat ignored on the shelf and with the right champion on it and the right investment made to get that story out personally i believe there is an opportunity there thats a little outside of our control so right now were just assuming that will continue the historic path adam jesse josephson  keybanc capital markets inc thanks a lot tony best of luck anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director thanks adam operator and at this time there are no further questions anthony j allott  president chief executive officer  director great thank you everyone for the time enjoy the rest of your summer
