industry global semiconductor market focus on good poweraware verification strategy for socs dr wally rhines january   pradeep chakraborty  comment dr wally rhines it is always a pleasure to chat with dr wally walden c rhines chairman and ceo of mentor graphics i chatted with him trying to understand gigascale design verification trends strategy for poweraware verification serdes design challenges migrating to d finfet transistors and moore’s law getting to be “moore stress” chip design in gigascale hertz complex first i asked him to elaborate on how implementation of chip design will evolve with respect to gigascale design gigahertz and gigacomplex geometries he said “thanks to close cooperation among members of the foundry ecosystem as well as cooperation between idms and their suppliers serious development of design methods and software tools is running two to three generations ahead of volume manufacturing capability for most applications “gigascale” power dissipation is a bigger challenge than managing the complexity but “systemlevel” power optimization tools will continue to allow rapid progress thermal analysis is becoming part of the designer’s toolkit” functional verification is continually challenged by complexity but there have been and continue to be many orders of magnitude improvement in performance just from adoption of emulation intelligent test benches and formal methods so this will not be a major limitation the complexity of new physical design problems will however be very challenging design problems ranging from basic esd analysis made more complex due to multiple power domains to emi electromigration and intradie variability are now being addressed with new design approaches fortunately programmable electrical rule checking is being widely adopted and will help to minimize the impact of these physical effects is verification keeping up how is the innovation in verification keeping up with trends dr rhines added that over the past decade microprocessor clock speeds have leveled out at  to  ghz and server performance improvement has come mostly from multicore architectures although some innovative approaches have allowed simulators to gain some advantage from multicore architectures the speed of simulators hasn’t kept up with the growing complexity of leading edge chips emulators have more than made up the difference emulators offer more than four orders of magnitude faster performance than simulators and emulators do so at about x the cost per cycle of simulation the cost of power per year is more than one third the cost of hardware in a large simulation farm today while emulation offers a x savings in power per verification clock cycle for those who design really complex chips a combination of emulation and simulation along with formal methods and intelligent test benches has become standard at the block and subsystem level high level synthesis is enabling the next move up in design and verification abstraction since verification complexity grows at about the square of component count we have plenty of room to handle larger chips by taking advantage of the four orders of magnitude improvement through emulation plus another three or four orders of magnitude through formal verification techniques two to three orders of magnitude from intelligent test benches and three orders of magnitude from higher levels of abstraction by applying multiple engines and multiple abstraction levels to the challenge of verifying chips the pressure is on to integrate the flow easily transitioning and reusing verification efforts from every level—including tests and coverage models from high level models to rtl and from simulation to emulation—is being enabled through more powerful and adaptable verification ip and high level graphbased test specification capabilities these are keys to driving verification reuse to match the level of design reuse powerful verification management solutions enable the collection of coverage information from all engines and abstraction levels tracking progress against functional specifications and verification plans combining verification cycle productivity growth from emulation formal simulation and intelligent testing with higher verification abstraction reuse and process management provides a path forward to economically verifying even the largest most complex chips on time and within budget good poweraware verification strategy for socs what should be a good poweraware verification strategy for socs according to him the most important guideline is to start poweraware design at the highest possible level of system description the opportunity to reduce system power is typically an order of magnitude greater at the system level than at the rtl level for most chips today that means at least the transaction level when the design is still described in c or systemc significant experience and effort should then be invested at the rtl level using synthesis and upfenabled simulation verification solutions typically automate the generation of correctness checks for powercontrol sequences and powerstate coverage metrics as soc power is typically managed by software the value of a hardwaresoftware coverification and codebug solution in simulation and emulation becomes apparent in powermanagement verification at this level as designers proceed to the gate and transistor level accuracy of power estimation improves that is why gate level analysis and verification of the fully implemented power management architecture is important finally at the physical layout designers traditionally were stuck with whatever power budget was passed down to them nowthey increasingly have power goals that can be achieved using dozens of physical design techniques that are built into the place and route tools read more…   share thisfacebooktwitteremailgooglelinkedinprintpinterestreddittumblrlike thislike

semiconductor industry outlook  november   pradeep chakraborty  comments dr wally rhines it always gives me great pleasure chatting with dr walden wallly c rhines chairman and ceo of mentor graphics and vice chairman of the eda consortium usa  is just round the corner what lies ahead for the global semiconductor industry is a question on everyone’s lips how will the eda industry do next year for that matter what should the indian semiconductor industry look forward to next year three trends for  first i asked dr wally rhines regarding the trends in the global semiconductor industry he cited  growth in communication ics  growth in the third dimension  accelerated design activity at the leading edge growth in communication ics on the macro level silicon area shipments continue to grow gradually as do semiconductor unit shipments however there’s a major shift in application segments from computing to communications communications used to be only one third the size of computing in terms of semiconductor usage communications are expected to surpass computing in terms of semiconductor consumption by  thanks to the rapid growth of wireless applications the incorporation of computing into communications devices like smart phones and the addition of communications to computing devices like tablet computers growth in the third dimension shrinking feature sizes and growing wafer diameters will continue to contribute to the annual  percent decrease in the average cost per transistor and average  percent unit growth of transistors but they will do so at a diminished rate fortunately other avenues are emerging that can help sustain the semiconductor industry’s remarkable rate of growth one largely untapped opportunity is in the third dimension ie growing vertically instead of shrinking in the xy plane dram stacks of eight or more die are already possible although they are still more expensive on a cost per bit basis compared to unstacked devices complex packaged systems made up of multiple heterogeneous die memory stacked on logic and interposers to connect the die are evolving rapidly layers in the ic manufacturing process continue to increase as well accelerated design activity at the leading edge another interesting trend is the recent surge in capital spending among foundries to add capacity at the leading edge this wave of spending will result in excess capacity at least initially which may force foundries to lower prices to boost demand in fact capacity utilization data in the last few months shows a dramatic decline in utilization at nm and nm nodes suggesting that excess capacity is already happening to an extent while differences in  and nm processes—such as double patterning—create challenges the existing capital equipment is largely compatible with both processes such a high volume of wafers and the large available capacity will lead to increasingly aggressive wafer pricing over time as a result costeffective wafers from foundries will encourage totally new designs that would not have been possible at today’s wafer cost industry outlook  so how is the outlook for  going to shape up dr rhines said “after almost no growth in  most analysts are expecting improvement in semiconductor market growth in the coming year currently the analyst forecasts for the semiconductor industry in  range from  percent on the low side to  percent on the high side with most firms coming in between  percent and  percent the average of forecasts among the major semiconductor analyst firms is approximately  percent “however most semiconductor companies are less optimistic in their published outlooks this seems to be influenced by the level of uncertainty that exists because of unknown government actions and market conditions in the us europe and china” any more consolidations it would be interesting to hear dr rhines’ opinion on any further consolidations within the industry he said “it is common misperception that the semiconductor industry is consolidating a closer look at the data shows that the semiconductor industry has been doing the opposite it has been deconsolidating for more than  years “take the  semiconductor supplier intel intel’s market share is the same today as it was a decade ago and the combined market share of the top five semiconductor suppliers has been slowly declining since the s similar trends also apply to the top ten and top —both are the same or lower than they were a decade as well as decades ago in fact the combined market share of the top  semiconductor companies has decreased  points in the last  years read more…   share thisfacebooktwitteremailgooglelinkedinprintpinterestreddittumblrlike thislike loading categories chip design chip industry eda eda consortium

pleasure interacting with dr walden wally c rhines the chairman and ceo mentor graphics and vice chairman of the eda consortium usa i started by enquiring about the global semiconductor industry dr wally rhines dr wally rhines said “the absolute size of the semiconductor industry in terms or total revenue differs depending on which analyst you ask because of differences in methodology and the breadth of analysts’ surveys current  forecasts include  billion from gartner  billion from idc  billion from ihs isuppli  billion from semico research and  billion from ic insights “these numbers reflect growth rates from  per cent to  per cent based on the different analystspecific  totals capital spending forecasts for the three largest semiconductor companies have increased by almost  per cent just since the beginning of this year however the initial spurt of demand was influenced by the replenishment of computer and disc drive inventories caused by the thailand flooding now that this is largely complete there is some uncertainty about the second half “so overall it looks like the industry will pass  billion this year but it may not be by very much the strong capital spending and demand for leading edge capacity should impact the second half but the bigger impact will probably be in  what’s with nm has nm semiconductor technology become a major ‘work horse’ what’s going on in that area at least this area is now of considerable interest dr rhines said that the semiconductor industry’s transition to the nm family of technologies which broadly includes nm and nm is a much larger transition than we have experienced for many technology generations the world’s nmcapable capacity now comprises almost  per cent of the total silicon area in production and yet the silicon foundries are fully loaded with more nm demand than they can handle in fact high demand for nm has created a capacity pinch that is currently spurring additional capital expenditure by foundries he added “as yields and throughput mature at nm the major wave of capital investment will provide plentiful foundry capacity at lower cost stimulating a major wave of design activity costeffective high yield nm foundry capacity will not only drive increasing numbers of new designs but it will also force redesigns of mature products to take advantage of the cost reduction opportunity” read more…

recall a discussion in mid where an industry expert mentioned that fabless was the way forward for the indian industry between then and now fabs were supposed to come up but they failed nevertheless one must not give up hope as of now there seems to be too much focus on services multinational company dominance perceived lack of progress perceived lag compared to china lack of foundry

wally rhines chairman and ceo mentor graphics the global semiconductor industry keeps consolidating said dr walden wally rhines while making the keynote presentation at the ongoing mentor graphics’ uu conference in bangalore india according to a survey the no ’s market share has been relatively flat since  the combined share of the top five semiconductor companies has been nearly the same as that of  however the share of the top  companies has been nearly the same but less than the historical average if you look at the numbers it is also evident that texas instruments’ ti acquisition of national semiconductors has had negligible impact also the market share of the top  semiconductor companies continues to decline especially in the last decade the answer lies in the fact that manufacturing is consolidating while semiconductor is not foundries share of semiconductor revenue has increased the share of total ic production has been flat however foundry capex has tripled over the last two years also nmnm capacity has been sold out and prices rising have been put on top of the next slide foundries are likely to revamp and record the highest market share of the nmnm market foundry spending is said to be at an all time high as percentage of total capex there have been significant design changes in fact nm has now become the ‘work horse’ technology there have been high yields and at lower costs the accelerated design activity has seen redesign take advantage of smalller node efficiencies so how can you prepare perhaps do more design in less time and use the same resources or you could do less of power devices significant changes are coming in design because of  capital expenditures nm semiconductor technology will become a major “work horse” compared to previous technology generations plenty of wafers will be available from silicon foundries yields will be high and costs will be low  as a result design activity will accelerate beginning in late  to take advantage of the nm capability and capacity favorable costs and yields will cause semiconductor companies to redesign nm products into nm versions while adding functionality totally new applications will emerge because of the nm capability and cost thus growing the semiconductor market in  implications of plentiful nm foundry capacity include nm will become “work horse” technology there will be high yields and low costs as well as an accelerated design activity redesigns will take advantage of smaller node cost efficiencies new designs will leverage the additional transistors in future more companies will be moving to eslbased design place and route will be more in fashion — nm double patterning as well as dfm and integrated verification dfm will pave the way for designing

india for a short conversation regarding the global semiconductor industry growth of global semicon industry first i sought dr rhines’ views on the growth of the global semiconductor industry dr rhines said “capital investment in the foundries has been quite high tsmc globalfoundries samsung etc have invested double in  some of the foundries will run at a lower percentage of capacity if that happens foundry wafer prices might fall however equipment prices would not decrease” so what has the industry learned from the previous recession he said “capacity in the semicon industry was relatively tight in q in  we called it as inventory correction if we had not had a recession there would have been a capacity shortage “now companies seem to have caught up there was large investment in the manufacturing capacity in  and that has continued into  there is more new capacity coming into foundries by  investment in memory has been modest however fabless companies should find more capacity in ” hanns windele added “the automotive industry was contributing to all of this as well as of now  percent is consumed by the computer industry  percent by the communications industry and consumer electronics and automotive account for  percent approximately” it appears that everything that one buys today communications seems to be attached to it dr rhines also reckoned that pc

according to dr walden wally c rhines chairman and ceo mentor graphics corp customers pay a premium for differentiated products gross profit margin gpm percentage is the best measure for the differentiation of a manufactured product the difficulty of switching suppliers is proportional to differentiation and gpm he was speaking at the eda tech forum  in bangalore india as an example apple released the mac classic to compete with ibm clones to regain market share in the pc industry however it did not gain market ascendancy it was only when apple introduced the ipod in h’  that things began changing later it introduced the apple ipad h ’ the rest is for now history product differentiation is said to be easiest in new and emerging markets apple has since invested in semiconductor design while nokia has divested apple now reduces power and improves performance through design differentiation on the other hand nokia has divested of ic design as it is now difficult to create a differentiated ecosystem even for the leader nokia as of now it is using windows mobile  for developing smartphones the question is is the android vs iphone an analogy to the pc vs the mac the smartphone market will eventually commoditize however this time there has been substantial differentiation product differentiation does provide temporary differentiation  however a company created infrastructure sustains differentiation the thirdparty ecosystem drives a longer term differentiation now apple isn’t the only company with sustainable differentiation intel and amd have also invested in application development with intel’s x mpus differentiation a prime example in mature commodity products system integration reduces cost and power with increasing performance for example texas

mentor graphics eda’s role in modeling and photomask correction i asked dr rhines about the future of eda’s role in modeling and photomask correction he said that in just a decade resolution enhancement has grown from zero to over  million in annual revenue for the eda industry “almost all of this revenue is concentrated in two eda companies the value of this eda software is clearly recognized by manufacturers mentor has many partnerships with manufacturers and a joint development program targeting nm resolution enhancement with ibm” handling nm and subnm levels next with new process technology nodes becoming quite the talk of the desgin community what does eda now need to do at nm and sub nm levels dr rhines said “we have been working with our customers on this for quite some time now and are in fact well down this path we think that most of the problems have been solved or are solvable obviously most of the issues here revolve around the lithography and manufacturability but the eda industry has been leading this since optical proximity correction became a key technology for the fabs quite some time ago” density area savings in an earlier discussion the issue of how compelling would integration density area savings remain by going to new nodes had come up i have to repeat this question as it still seems to remain an issue so how long will the integration density area savings you get by going to new nodes remain compelling “hard to say” noted dr rhines “we can see a path to nm with the traditional nm immersion lithography and we usually surprise ourselves in our ability to go farther than we think we can however even if density slows down this is but one way to achieve the continuous performance improvements that we’ve seen over the years in silicon “d silicon for instance holds the promise of allowing us to continue to grow performance without necessarily doing it by just continuing the process shrink logic and memory have been on a predictable “learning curve” since the vacuum tube and i don’t expect that learning curve to deviate anytime in the foreseeable future” read more…   share

percent of the annual market the global fab industry continues to figure out how to decrease costs while design costs are projected to grow logarithmically cost per function will continue to decline

ceo mentor graphics post his technical keynote at the recently held vlsid  we discussed a range of issues such as the global semiconductor and eda industries as well as the indian industry global semicon industry according to dr rhines the global semiconductor industry is currently on a rapid recovery curve however that the semiconductor total available market tam would decline in  due to the weakness of h he added that the global semiconductor industry’s growth could even be as much as  percent during  as also advised by malcolm penn of future horizons this number can definitely change rather than remain so optimistically high as the year goes by yes malcolm’s an optimist dr  rhines said “if you look at the major semiconductor companies most of them will have an opportunity to grow — after the q results are in” on the global eda industry so how will all of this contribute to the well being of the global eda industry according to dr rhines the eda industry has been a little different mentor and synopsys have probably had more growth and stability “mentor could be the only company to grow bookings in q have grown by  percent and revenue by  percent we are perhaps the only major eda company that has grown” he said in the long term eda tends to trend with semiconductor rd semiconductor rd was flat in  down in  and will probably grow in  so eda will probably lag in ” advise for indian semicon industry i also requested dr rhines to advise the indian semiconductor industry he said “the indian semiconductor industry needs to look at more of systems and ic design as well as embedded software development india should also have more product startups what makes india unique is its talent education etc india is now producing its own electronic design architecture and embedded software and it also has the systems infrastructure india can greatly advance what it already does so well” commenting on the industry’s weaknesses he added that the indian semiconductor industry needs to increase the infrastructure for its local startups that infrastructure would require things such as vcs and especially a cultural acceptance of failure also if india does not have the intrinsic semiconductor manufacturing capability then it needs to stay current on the evolving technologies does india need a fab on being asked this question dr rhines’ reply was immediate “i don’t think india ever needed a fab you can easily have closer relationships with other fabs the highest paying jobs are design and innovation etc the recession has been driving down costs and innovation has been happening there are big growing markets — in india and asia” share thisfacebooktwitteremailgooglelinkedinprintpinterestreddittumblrlike thislike loading categories eda global eda
