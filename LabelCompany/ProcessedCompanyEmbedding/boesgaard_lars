i’ll now turn the call over to mary duseau mary duseau thanks lars and welcome to our first quarter results call during the first quarter we continued to make commercial progress we placed four instruments with three new customers in strategically important segments of dairy produce and poultry the underlying growth of our business is expressed by test volume which was up a healthy  from the previous quarter it is fair to say that the food safety market is very active according to food safety magazine  saw a  increase in food recalls reaching approximately  total recalls in the us and canada or more than two per day lars will discuss our financial performance in more detail but first i would like to add some color regarding the strategic and human health importance of the new customers two of the initiatives this quarter are for cheese testing these outlets placement are timely given two significant food recalls involving cheese in the last  days one of the recalls resulted in two deaths both situations involved listeria in cheese and the more precise tracking methods being used by the regulators allowed the quick action to contain the impact of this foodborne outbreak the first case involves soft cheese from vulto creamery and unfortunately resulted in eight illnesses and two deaths in this case the same genetic sequence of bacteria was found in the patient and the cheese in the patients refrigerator and in the vulto creamery production front quick regulatory action and dna evidence allowed contaminated product to be recalled before the others could be impacted in the second case contaminated products was identified during routine grocery sampling by the tennessee department of agriculture the bacteria found in the grocery store cheese had a dna match to bacteria found in a plant operated by deutsch kase haus this led to a large recall impacting over a  different cheese products from well known brands including sargento sara lee saputo and dutch valley additionally there were knock on recall effects in further processed food such as taylor farm signature salad fortunately in this case state level product sampling dna evidence and traceability back to the source issue likely prevented many illnesses these recent incidents remind us of how dangerous and deadly pathogenic bacteria can be and how important it is for food producers to understand and manage the quality of their pathogen testing program we applaud the food producers who are becoming more proactive and upgrading their testing technology to atlas this is in an effort to strengthen their food safety testing program at roka our commercial team is making good progress in finding these proactive companies and i am pleased with the work that were doing to close important accounts in addition to the good work with customers were active with regulators consumer groups and legislators as we work to raise awareness for the importance of food safety and using accurate and current technology for pathogen testing overall i feel very good about the progress that were making this is laying an important foundation for future growth of our atlas business as we are midway through the second quarter we have secured three additional instrument placements with customers we also had to make some very tough decisions in the first quarter in order to reduce our expenses and although reductions and personnel are never easy we need to be focused on building a profitable business since our beginning we have developed a portfolio of highly competitive pathogen detection assays which address the vast majority of the market and this allowed us to reduce our expenses and product development and focus our resources on commercialization of our existing products in summary i am encouraged by the progress that we are making to grow our business and to realize efficiencies wherever possible with that ill turn the call back over to you lars lars boesgaard thanks mary ill now turn to the financial results for the first quarter of  as we reported just earlier today revenue for the quarter was  million which was an increase of  million or about  compared with the same quarter of last year during the quarter we sold approximately  atlas detection assays which compares to  for the same period in  we ended the quarter with  installed instruments and our average analyzed revenue per instrument was approximately  compared to the fourth quarter of  we saw our revenue increase by  in the fourth quarter our revenue included the sale of an atlas instrument and when you look beyond the overall revenue numbers sales of atlas test increased by  from the previous quarter as mentioned by mary just previously we believe that this increase is a meaningful indicator of the underlying growth of our business which reflects the recurrent use of our customers atlas instruments as mary mentioned during the quarter we placed four atlas instruments with three separate customers we also took back three instruments from customers in locations where the instruments were not being utilized we therefore do not expect that the return of three instruments in the quarter will have a negative impact on our future atlas test volume sales and revenues cost of revenue was  million for the quarter mostly unchanged compared to the same period in  we’re pleased that although revenue and sales volume are up approximately  compared to last year weve been able to keep cost of revenue roughly unchanged during the first quarter of  we completed actions to reduce our operating expenses we expect these actions which were primarily aimed to reduce our organizational footprint in our development group and administrative area will result in a reduction of operating expenses of approximately  million quarterly going forward we recognized approximately  million in separation related expense in the first quarter in addition to the reduction in headcount we’ve also amended our bid agreement to defer principal repayments for the second quarter of  and entered into a revolving line of credit agreement which we expect will contribute positively in to our cash position in the future research development expense was  million for the quarter compared to  million for the same period in  the decrease was primarily due to lower external research expenses incurred in the quarter as well as lower expenses for payroll and supplies selling general and administrative expense was  million for the quarter compared to  million for the same period in  the increase was primarily due to separation payments to employees and high expenses related to outside services those are partially offset by decreases and other compensation costs and lower promotional expenses amortization expense for intangibles was unchanged at  million compared to the same period last year net loss for the first quarter was  million compared to a net loss of  million for the same period in  the primary driver of the reduced loss was the increase in our revenue for the quarter we ended the quarter with cash investment of  million compared to  million at the end of  our cash burn during the first quarter was therefore approximately  million we generally incur higher expenses in cash usage in the first quarter of the year and based on cost savings measures implemented during the first quarter along with changes to our loan agreement we expect our cash burn to decrease significantly in the second quarter where we estimate a cash burn in the range of  million to  million at this time i will ask the operator to open up the call for any questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from jeffrey cohen of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead jeffrey cohen alright guys can you hear me okay mary duseau yes we hear you great jeffrey jeffrey cohen wonderful thanks mary thanks lars just two questions there is something you could extrapolate and give us further color on firstly lars you just said that the income was actually up you expected the opex to decrease down to the  million to  million on a quarterly basis can you talk about that mainly further detail and as far as how that looks relative to our sga and rd and secondly can you talk about the instrument placements you mentioned  but i am reading  and can you talk about utilization and trends out there amongst utilization and can you also talk about some of the pipeline in some of the sectors of industry that youre seeing with some of the pipeline thank you mary duseau thanks for that im going to lars take the first question and then ill take the second lars boesgaard hi jeff so the majority of the decrease we expect to see in the future as we saw the reductions we had to do in the first quarter are going to come out of our development expense thats where as mary mentioned we have been able to slim down the organization a bit there reflecting the completion of the bulk of the development work that we had to do in order to get the atlas assays developed mary duseau great and then ill take the second question which i’ll take in a couple of different pieces i’ll start with the pipeline and how things are looking and you know as you may know the commercial team is focused by segment i mentioned quite a bit about dairy at the start but we were also focused in produce poultry etc in each one of those segments the pipeline is looking good so theres a good active list of key customers and the team is focused on getting what i would call those evangelists customers across the line that will hopefully pull their friends along with them as well so from a pipeline perspective thats looking good from a utilization and from a commercial strategy standpoint there is really two things one is new instrument placements but then also as you mentioned utilization of existing instruments and so were focused both at finding new placements and new customers as well as driving additional capacity in the fleet thats out there and were making some progress in that regard as well so the commercial team continues to be focused on both of those i think lars boesgaard i think jeff had a question about utilization and trends in that respect jeffrey cohen yes little bit on utilization and mary if you could further expound any at all i would appreciate as far as pipeline related to animal and protein as well as grains as well as vegetables and some of the areas in particular that you see strength out of mary duseau lars you take utilization first lars boesgaard yes i can talk about utilization jeff so the average utilization of the instruments at the end of the first quarter was more or less flat as weve seen in the past so were still looking at about  when we decided together with our customers to pull back a couple of instruments in the first quarter thats really part of us making sure that the fleet we have out there is a fleet thats being run optimally and so that alone will contribute to us to see a higher utilization on the fleet out there it is really a fairly wide range were seeing right now in terms of utilization i think to marys earlier point we are really working to  with both new customers as well as existing customers to fill up the instruments effectively to achieve a higher  high utilization and theres plenty of capacity in some of the instruments out there that can really add to the top line for us mary duseau and then jeffrey let me take a stab at the other market segments as well so i think weve talked in the past about the food safety modernization act that puts down rules now that processors have to test and in the case of segments like produce thats new and while the food safety modernization act was signed quite some time ago back in  the produce safety rules in terms of being implemented are just now happening so i would say produce is an example where were getting some good traction and we already have good business in the produce segment the other area where again tied to the food safety modernization act is the new regulation to knock down the salmonella load in poultry and the poultry processors out there are working hard to make that happen and thats an area where again we see some good traction and the atlas system has some unique capabilities to do some novel applications in terms of the connotations of salmonella load on poultry other market segment like ingredients and things like spices chocolate other areas i had mentioned dairy pet food these are all areas where we have good line of sight in the pipeline jeffrey cohen okay thanks lars and mary i appreciate it mary duseau thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to lars boesgaard for any closing remarks lars boesgaard thanks carrie i just want to thank
