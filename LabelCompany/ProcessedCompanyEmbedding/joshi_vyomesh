joshi the business plan is simple executing it is hardthe executive from hps imaging and printing group explains the five pillars of a sustainable business and how to see them throughnovember  by marguerite rigoglioso email what does it take for a company to create a sustainable business identify holes in the market develop appropriate price models establish business partnerships with other enterprises foster respect and trust with employees and provide leadership that puts business first people second and managers egos third these were the five key success factors distilled from  years experience with hewlettpackard co that vyomesh joshi executive vice president of hps imaging and printing group shared with attendees of the th annual net impact conference on nov  they sound simple joshi said but in fact theyre hard to do addressing an audience eager to hear how corporations are integrating social and environmental responsibility into their bottom lines joshi also said that hp partners with retailers in take back programs to retrieve and recycle  million pounds of used inkjet and laserjet printer cartridge paraphernalia each year there must be a balance between caring for the environment and shareholders he said you can do both soon every hp inkjet cartridge will come with a postagepaid envelope for return when depleted he announced and the company is ramping up the energysaving functions such as sleep mode on its printers hp also has social projects in several regions in the united states and abroad to expand communities access to computer technology these efforts dont make money but we see them as part of our corporate responsibility joshi said joshi focused his remarks on what it has taken to help build hp imaging and printing into a  billion business in  when we started we had no idea we would be so successful he said we simply saw a market trend — that personal computers would be big reasoning that people would want to be able to print right off their desktop the new team figured out how to use inkjet and laser technologies to create a lowend product for home users and a more upscale model for offices the group then filed for numerous patents on its products to create barriers to entry by competitors and settled on a market pricing structure it paired up with canon an expert in laser technology to create a longterm partnership that has helped make hp printers nearly ubiquitous in offices around the world success at hp has been about more than managing technology well however it has been about managing people well joshi said in  hp was the only place i wanted to work i knew that if i did the right thing there the right thing would happen what contributes to hps strength as a company he told young professionals in the audience is its emphasis on helping employees trust and feel respected by management i follow our founders practice of managing by walking around joshi said youve got to talk to people to find out what theyre thinking and be honest and transparent in return joshi said his own experience has proven that part of being successful is cultivating leadership thats not afraid to flinch in the face of difficulties and hard decisions in  weve had to let  people go to get our cost structure in line he said it was a very tough thing to do but what helped us was knowing we had to put the business above all else joshi concluded by listing some key trends that are driving new business models including the primacy of digital versus analog and the increasing presence of the internet people spend  percent of their free time on the web versus  percent reading the newspaper yet advertising agencies for example spend  percent of their budgets on newspapers and only  percent on the internet that will switch completely hp itself he said is currently experimenting with products that will align with that trend such as devices that connect directly to the internet without the intermediary of the pc youve got to constantly figure out how to create new value propositions to meet customer needs in new ways he told the crowd if you miss the opportunity you dont catch up the nov — net impact conference at

twitter pinterest facebook linkedin youtube videos rss the voice of d printing  additive manufacturing select page d systems appoints former hp exec vyomesh joshi as new president and ceo by scott j grunewald  apr    d printing business  share on tumblrglobal d printing and d printer manufacturing leader d systems has finally announced their replacement for former ceo avi reichental who stepped down last october amidst plummeting stock prices and controversy effective immediately vyomesh joshi vj has been named as the company’s new president and ceo by the d systems board vj will replace interimpresident and ceo andy johnson who will stay with d systems as d systems’ executive vice president and chief legal officer the appointment comes after the role was vacant for nearly six months and at a crucial time for the company that seems to be trying to redefine its role within the industryd systems’ new president and ceo vyomesh joshivj is a former vice president of imaging and printing at hewlett packard and is widely regarded as responsible for doubling the struggling printing business’ operating profits during the year period that he was with the company after the closing down of d systems cube line of desktop d printers and d printing products the company has been refocusing its efforts into the industrial d printing market so far the move seems to be finally heading the company in the right direction as the head of a  billion printing business vj is ideally suited to take the reins of a d printing company that is seeking to reposition itself as a leader in industrial and commercial d printing applications“we are pleased to announce vj’s appointment as president and ceo of d systems vj’s significant experience scaling and strengthening technologydriven businesses his expertise in product development and innovation and his proven track record of operational excellence make him the ideal candidate to lead our company into its next era” said chairman of the d systems board of directors wally loewenbaumto suggest that replacing reichenthal was going to be quick and easy is to completely ignore d systems as a company and the state of the business that he left behind him while publically the split was amicable it is doubtful that behind closed doors it was quite so cordial reichental’s resignation came after a string of bad news poorly chosen acquisitions and lawsuits that plagued d systems throughout  including stock prices dipping to unprecedented lows the loss of several legal battles and the implosion of the company’s desktop division avi reichental former president and ceo of d systemsregardless of the obvious errors in judgement made by reichental it is impossible to ignore the fact that he was a force of nature within the company and within the d printing industry itself he was unquestionably a large contributor to the public’s greater understanding and embrace of d printing technology between giving ted talks enticing celebrity endorsements and spearheading a massive public advertising campaign reichental was the face of d printing for nearly two years and for a while at least d systems enjoyed the fruits of his labor by positioning himself as the d printing mastermind reichental put a target on his head a mile wide if anything went wrong with d systems so when things started to fall apart it was not at all surprising that he would be the first person to go not only was he directly responsible for many of the poorly chosen business decisions but he was widely seen as the cause of much of the dysfunctional corporate culture at d systems however it is shocking that he seemed to be the only high level executive to get the boot especially considering how very dysfunctional that corporate culture reportedly was “i am incredibly excited about the future of d systems we have a tremendous opportunity to help customers take advantage of the era of manufacturing transformation including mass customization while the company has a strong history in place it is clear that we need to develop new and innovative products with unprecedented quality and service levels to drive sustainable growth and profits” said new d systems president and ceo vyomesh joshiwhile there has been some positive momentum coming from d systems lately the dysfunctional nature of the company still seems to be in place taking d systems back to its heyday of stock market success and positive public opinion isn’t going to be an easy job unless some structure changes are made to the company let’s hope vj’s success at hp another company often plagued by dysfunctional executive culture helps him putting d systems back together again any thoughts discuss in the d systems vj as new ceo forum over at

the operating profits of the division over the course of  years without delving into the role of hps management at the time we can say that joshi ended his year career with the tech giant when meg whitman took over in  d systems ceo vyomesh joshi image courtesy of d systems why did joshi leave the comforts of retirement at the age of  “i got really bored” joshi said what could stir him out of his boredom more than an exciting advanced manufacturing technology like d printing according to the ceo it wasnt just d printing that pulled him out of retirement it was d systems founder chuck hull and his latest d printing platform the figure  “this opportunity came in and i said ‘oh wow i can make a real contribution here’” joshi said “i had a conversation with chuck hull when he showed me the figure  and i thought that it was really interesting so i said ‘hey this could be fun i can take all of my knowledge and really apply that with a great team’” he added “i was retired and i didn’t have to do this thing but when i saw the guy who invented the whole industry excited about what he could do with the technology and when i looked at the portfolio…” though its competitor stratasys has the largest market share in the industry d systems easily has the broadest product portfolio including stereolithography colorjet printing multijet printing direct metal printing selective laser sintering and with figure  continuous digital light processing technologies on the additive manufacturing front but it also develops software through geomagic and cimatron and mixedreality products through simbionix with a birds eye view of the entire company joshi began to understand his role in the company “then i looked at the operational problems once i joined i talked to kevin mcalea and all of the puzzle pieces fell into place i knew i needed to augment some of the teams but i really thought that we could make this company something really big” beginning with healthcare joshi sees what mcalea has done with the firms healthcare division as a successful model to follow with d systems other verticals by segmenting the market as he did with hps printing business and then extrapolating the companys healthcare model to those segments—currently outlined by joshi as the aerospace and defense automotive and durable goods markets—he believes it would be possible to make d systems into a tech giant in explaining the strategy joshi began with his work at hp “when i was at hp it was great to really drive the transformation of a printing industry and build a big business there that was very exciting because i learned a lot about starting with the customer taking over the technology and creating a great value proposition the other thing is—especially in the graphics business that we built from scratch—there was a big transformation happening as we went from analog to digital highlevel presses had been the way people were making books and magazines and doing marketing collateral then you could begin to do those things digitally all of a sudden” he continued “the approach that i took then was to segment the market and understand the use cases if you took the use cases and created an endtoend workflow then you would be able to move from analog to digital so when i started working at d systems i first understood the core technology platforms and the great kind of products we had then i talked to kevin mcalea about how he built his healthcare business similar to how i had with customer segmentation in terms of workflows i said ‘if you can take this technology and move from prototyping to manufacturing and apply the same principles that kevin applied in creating a vertical i think we can take this company to the next level’” the workflow that mcalea has created for the healthcare division sees d printing as one step in a larger process this process sees physical objects digitized through d scanning or specialty software and products designed with cad these models can then be simulated with simulation software including d systems simbionix virtual surgery modules before they are manufactured in the physical world with d printing afterwards inspection tools perform essential quality control procedures and the management of the end product takes place joshi said that he has made mcalea not only head of healthcare for d systems but head of metal d printing in the hopes that the executive can build d systems aerospace and defense division in the same way mcalea believes that while aerospace and healthcare may seem fundamentally different the two industries have much more in common than one might think “there are differences between medical and aerospace once you get into the details the medical field has all of the issues associated with biocompatibility and mechanical properties are important but not critical whereas with aerospace mechanical properties are absolutely essential but companies dont worry about things like biocompatibility” mcalea said “but a lot of the building blocks to be a dprinted cervical implant image courtesy of d systems successful in these advanced manufacturing applications are the same” some of the building blocks mcalea referred to are segmenting the market and use cases developing products to meet the requirements of those markets and hiring the right people from the right industries in the case of the healthcare division the company already has a cohesive workflow a product portfolio tailored to specific use cases and a skilled staff that is knowledgeable about d printing in healthcare due to  years in the industry d systems just needs to ensure that the same model is executed in its aerospace and defense decision according to joshi and mcalea the company is basically already there “as an example here at the healthcare technology center we have iso certification for producing medical devices” mcalea said “we had someone do a gap analysis for us for what would it take to get as aerospace certification the gap was very small we can do that work in about three months for low cost if we were starting from scratch it would take years” the future of d printing with d systems reading our previous article on the healthcare technology center its clear that d printing is already having a big impact on the medical industry with the ability to plan surgeries with patientspecific models and produce patientspecific devices the benefits seem obvious on an anecdotal level mcalea pointed out that clinical studies are now reinforcing stories of d printings benefits in medicine with actual data now the technology must see greater adoption regardless of the industry in order for its impact to be truly felt joshi and mcalea pointed out that its often the younger generation that is more quick to adopt d printing while older professionals will fall back on years of experience with tried and true techniques while an established surgeon for instance might not be as quick to incorporate patientspecific models to plan a surgery mcalea has found that new surgeons cant see doing it any other way “theres always going to be a generational gap with new technology” mcalea said “we deal with a lot of training in cadaver labs in conjunction with our medical device partners there youre training all of these relatively new surgeons in surgical planning with d technology afterwards most of them say they would never consider doing it any other way” medical professionals using the simbionix angiogram simulator image courtesy of d systems he likens the situation to the adoption of flight simulators in the aerospace industry “pilots in the s were scornful of the notion of flight simulators today pilots cant go up unless theyve trained for hours on simulators” mcalea said both believed that the technology would gain widespread adoption as the younger generation begins to supplant the old and its the potential that this technology holds that is part of the reason that joshi decided to come out of retirement “the things that we do are so meaningful” joshi said “people dont usually get a chance to do this kind of stuff—to change the lives of people” he referred to a recent surgery in which d systems played a key role d printing presurgical models for a pair of twins joined at the skull “think about the mcdonald twins and the impact felt by their mom and dad we were really instrumental in making that surgery into a reality thats a big deal” please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus recommended for you subscribe

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
