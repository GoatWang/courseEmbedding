mobile applications — skip the traditional “heavy product” phase with its big sales force professional services and hefty price tag that only the fortune  could afford “the idea was to make it an easy product to use to adopt and at a much lower price point so new and smaller companies down to a couple of folks in a garage can go to our website download the product and within a couple of minutes be viewing metrics and getting value” sachleben says “every business is becoming a software business you used to walk into a bank talk to a teller and deposit a check these days you take a picture of the check and boom it’s deposited” he adds “your software has become the primary vehicle through which customers now interact” new relic employee number four sachleben remembers the early days “sitting on a couch trying to figure things out” since then he has led four rounds of funding totaling  million and in late  guided the company through an ipo that raised  million currently valued at  billion new relic has more than  customers covering the market spectrum from small to enterprise “it’s been amazing to watch” he says “when i see what our team has been able to do both in finance as well as the company and see thousands of customers use our product and get a positive experience” postipo and in today’s fastpaced and shifting market the challenge is balancing growth and profitability “investors want both” he says sachleben and new relic ceo and founder lew cirne approach that balancing act with a “consistent outlook” shaped by a year partnership at cirne’s previous startup wily technology sachleben was also employee number four and the senior financial executive until the company’s sale to ca technologies “as the cfo working with the ceo we’ve really got to be disciplined in making decisions” he says “information flows so fast in this day and age it’s tempting to be scared of potential short term issues that will cloud judgment when you should be looking at the long term”
