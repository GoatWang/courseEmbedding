of the business and has posted on its investor relations website wwwpginvestorcom a full reconciliation of nongaap and other financial measures now i will turn the call over to pgs vice chairman and chief financial officer jon moeller jon r moeller  procter  gamble co good morning im joined this morning by our chairman president and chief executive officer david taylor and by our vice president of investor relations john chevalier im going to quickly review our fiscal  and fourth quarter results david will discuss our plans and ill close our remarks with guidance for fiscal  well then open the call for your questions we met or exceeded each of our goingin fiscal  objectives in what turned out to be a very challenging year india currency demonetization and goods and services tax implementation geopolitical uncertainty and economic weakness in nigeria egypt and the middle east argentina brazil russia and the ukraine and also brexit each challenged us foreign exchange and commodity costs were a combined  million aftertax headwind on earnings and we took a direct hit from a tornado at our albany georgia family care plant underlying market growth decelerated from  last fiscal year to about  in fiscal  within this us market growth slowed from over  last year to just above  this year and barely above flat in the fourth quarter uk market growth declined about a point in fiscal  and nearly  points in fiscal  developing market growth slowed from over  last fiscal to about  this year and as you know we took some meaningful price reductions including on gillette in the us not knowing that most of this would happen at the start of fiscal  we targeted about  organic sales growth which is ultimately what we delivered its a meaningful achievement in the face of the headwinds ive just described and it includes half a point of headwind from brand and product form discontinuations that weve discussed throughout the year importantly the growth was  volume driven we planned as we went into the year to reduce the gap between pg top line growth and that of the underlying market we accelerated organic sales growth by more than a point from fiscal  to fiscal  in a market that decelerated by more than a point we held or improved our relative share performance in  of our largest  category country combinations either extending market share gains or narrowing share declines we said wed complete the strengthening and streamlining of the category and brand portfolio building value in the process which we did we expected to make strong cost savings progress in the first year of the next  billion productivity program which we accomplished we expected a small improvement in core operating margins we exceeded those expectations core operating margin increased  basis points  basis points excluding foreign exchange we targeted midsingle digit core earnings per share growth we exceeded this objective delivering  per share up  versus last year on a constant currency basis up  net of reinvestments into innovation sales coverage media and sampling productivity savings have enabled us to deliver constant currency core gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single to double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last five fiscal years averaging  over the last four fiscal years weve grown core gross margin by  basis points  basis points excluding currency impacts weve grown core operating margin by  basis points  basis points excluding foreign exchange our core aftertax margin now stands at about  second highest in our industry well improve this further as we go forward going into the year we projected another year of  or better free cash flow productivity and delivered  inventory and payables improved by one day and four days respectively and fiscal  was a year of significant value return to pg shareowners we paid  billion in dividends we reduced outstanding shares by  billion with the shares exchanged in the beauty transaction and we made over  billion of direct share repurchases in total nearly  billion in dividend payments share exchange and share repurchase a quick summary of the key top and bottom line metrics for the year organic sales were up  on organic volume growth of  all in sales were down less than half a point due to headwinds from foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures core earnings per share were  up  all in earnings per share were  up  including the significant gain from the beauty transaction adjusted free cash flow productivity as i said earlier was  details of our fourth quarter results are provided in the press release published earlier this morning so im just going to hit a few of the highlights underlying market growth for the quarter was about  reflecting many of the market challenges i mentioned earlier organic sales increased by more than  on organic volume growth of more than  all in sales were in line with the prior year online organic sales were up around  for the period significantly outpacing offline sales online sales represented more than  of our total business in fiscal  core earnings per share in the fourth quarter were  up  all in earnings per share were  up  core gross margin decreased  basis points  basis points of productivity savings was largely offset by a  basis point headwind from higher commodity costs and  basis points of mix impact core sga costs as a percentage of sales decreased  basis points excluding foreign exchange core sga cost declined  basis points including  basis points of productivity savings from the combination of overhead agency fee and ad production cost reductions the remaining reduction was driven by current period choices to temporarily stop spending with digital media outlets where our ads were not being placed according to our standards and specifications core operating profit improved  basis points including  basis points of productivity savings adjusted free cash flow productivity was  so to summarize fiscal  we delivered or over delivered each of our objectives in what was a very challenging year and made significant progress on key priorities accelerating organic sales growth continuing to drive strong productivity improvement and cost savings strengthening our organization and culture and completing the moves to strengthen and focus our portfolio significant progress which were singularly focused on increasing in fiscal  ill now hand it over to david to discuss those plans david s taylor  procter  gamble co thanks jon and good morning everyone i want to start my comments this morning where i ended them on the call last year our standards are high we arent satisfied which just being a little bit better than last year we want to be the best and were determined to win we are making progress but we know theres more work to do our objective is very clear balanced top and bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top third of our peer group the work weve began and the progress weve made have us building toward this level of results now as an organization we are accelerating efforts to execute and deliver on the plans weve put into action achieving our objectives will not only require continued focus as an organization but also that we prevent anything from derailing the work that is delivering improvement were working to accelerate organic sales growth by strengthening and extending the advantages weve created with our products and packages improving the execution of our consumer communication and onshelf and online presence and ensuring our brands offer superior consumer value in each price tier we choose to compete now ive had several questions on what is really changing so i want to add a little bit of perspective and this is not a marketing pitch but a statement of intent backed by action of what weve been doing and we will continue to do over the coming quarters and years the market clearly continues to be challenging whether its price transparency changing retail dynamics or established or new competitors online and offline or slowing market growth the best response in this environment is innovation and a greater level of superiority in all elements of the consumer proposition a higher standard that is what were doing starting with the consumer and shopper thats where we believe sustained success must start now the superiority of our products packages execution and consumer value create impactful meaningful advantages that will earn trial and repurchase that grow markets and build market share it is what will be required to prevent commoditization of our categories and minimize deflationary impacts it is required to reduce our promotion spending and create strong retail relevance across channels offline and online now at times people misunderstand this one but superiority does not mean most expensive or premium it means delivering maximum value holistically defined across all price points at which we choose to compete we need to deliver a big enough advantage to change consumers affinity for our brands and their expectation of the category and to assess and deliver superior products were moving from a single metric which is typically used as weighted purchase intent to a body of evidence approach this approach provides a holistic and transparent evaluation of the product at the second moment of truth it integrates technical tests and blind tests context dated tests household panel data and inmarket product reviews it adds behavioral data which is more reliable to the attitudinal data weve historically collected now theres many examples i could give first tide pods provides a great one after using pods for a fourweek test period consumers consistently lowered their assessment of their previously used detergent by more than  points using tide pods changed consumers performance expectation of a laundry detergent tide pods and gain flings have driven  of us laundry detergent category growth since they were introduced today those products generate  of category sales with pg holding nearly an  share of the form we expect this form to continue leading category growth in  just  of us households had tried unit dose detergents  were up to  of household penetration a  increase in just one year ariel pods are making a similar impact in developing markets where weve launched in poland unit dose products account for over  of laundry market value with pg holding over  share of the form  of households in poland use unit dose detergents in romania unit dose products account for nearly  of the laundry market with pgs share of the form reaching almost  household penetration is nearly  in romania in both markets the unit dose segment is growing we have plans to expand this superior form in japan early this fiscal followed by a few other markets later in the year another example always radiant its a product thats meeting the higher standard of excellence as our best performing feminine pad always radiant has superior ratings across all the body of evidence testing for product and packaging the technology absorbs  times its weight with unique proprietary absorbent material and provides up to  leakfree protection the packaging design is eyecatching innovative and premium preferred  times over competition in a controlled test and not surprisingly business results are very strong resales are up midteens driving market growth of the superpremium segment plus  radiants share in the us pad market is up nearly a point over the past six months weve launched this superior premium product in china and early results are positive always radiant and infinity hold the number one share position of the superpremium segment now packagings another area where we see great opportunities for innovation both online and offline different distribution channels demand different packaging solution one size doesnt fit all but it may fit for many we look to reapply packaging success models across the company a great online package innovation in china may also be great for online businesses in japan korea europe or the us but it may not be good for hypermarkets in any region superior packaging attracts the consumer at their first moment of truth provides integrity and quality protection and delights the consumer during use and in its responsible disposal superior packaging creates recognizable brand blocks at shelf it aides the consumer in selecting the best product for their needs and it conveys the equity of the brand and importantly closes the sale were developing a body of evidence approach like i described with products to test packaging superiority theres some examples here scent beads are doing a great job on both the product and the package it delivers against this new higher standard when consumers use scent beads for a fourweek test period they consistently lowered their assessment of their current product by more than  points the packaging shows the product and communicates the scent benefit with the squeezed scent release its distinctive familiar and appealing fabric enhancers are the fastest growing segment in the overall fabric care category growing midsingle digits and scent beads are the fastest growing form growing at a  rate pg scent bead offerings are growing over  now theres tremendous upside scent beads household penetration is only  and beads are currently used in only importantly  of laundry loads today were going to continue driving consumer awareness and trial through advertising campaigns and sampling programs to grow the category and grow our share and well enter new markets this fiscal year superior products and superior packages drive market growth this prevents commoditization market growth has been incredibly important in the journey of our brands over the last  years pgs us fabric care business has grown by  times or  in a market thats grown  times pg share has increased only  points market growth has been the main driver of pgs growth which weve driven with leading innovation over the past  years pgs global diaper business has grown  times  in a market thats grown  times pgs share has increased only modestly market growth has been the main driver of pg growth and weve led it with innovation and conversion of cloth diaper users product and package benefits need to be communicated with exceptional brand messaging advertisement makes you think talk laugh cry smile act and of course buy advertising that drives growth for brands and the categories in which they compete advertising that clears the highest bar for creative brilliance sparking conversations affecting and sometimes changing attitudes changing behavior and even defining popular culture were setting a higher standard of excellence on advertising quality with a focus on brand performance claims that communicate the brands benefit superiority to create awareness and trial were improving the quality of consumer insights agency creative talent and production were applying a body of evidence assessment on advertising quality for example the proven effective always like a girl campaign has significantly increased always brand awareness and our equity scores us category growth rates have accelerated and always has built nearly  points of market share since the campaign began other brands achieving this standard of quality are many tide dawn febreze bounty head  shoulders skii and vicks an external evaluation of our advertising has been strong pg received  creative excellence awards at cannes in june this is more than the next four most highly awarded competitors combined whats noteworthy is that all of the pg brand winners are both creative and effective at building business for example tides terry bradshaw stain super bowl commercial not only won multiple awards for its creative innovation across digital and live tv it led to us tides highest household penetration in the brands history and contributed to share growth for the year instore execution is another area where were redefining excellence to a higher standard growing categories and our brands this requires the right trade coverage with the right product forms sizes and price points and the right instore shelving and merchandising execution it requires delivering against key business drivers for each category and brand in every store across all channels every day in brazil weve revamped trade spending programs to reward the specific activities by brand and by channel now that are proven to drive sales weve demonstrated the value of longterm displays of our leading brands to top retailers these displays are high quality and clearly communicate our brand equities and product benefits they replace in and out promotional displays that were often low quality and inefficient were tracking compliance versus category specific key business drivers in over  individual stores when we get it right category growth accelerates our growth accelerates and we deliver trade spending efficiencies that enable us to reinvest and improve sales coverage to achieve excellence in even more stores were piloting new approaches and technologies including crowdsourcing image recognition and machine learning to obtain granular realtime data on store conditions to optimize our performance and coverage the execution is working brazil trade promotion spending is down over  basis points including the reinvestment into long term displays instore were delivering these savings while reaching record value share in our largest categories baby care shave care and hair care over the past  months the online shopping experience also demands executional excellence on amazon tide holds the top five search results for laundry detergent tide pods are the number one best seller with over  reviews at an average rating of  points the online execution includes video strong performance claims and strong value offerings for subscription options on walmartcom bounty is the number one search result for paper towels and the best seller behind strong brand content and superior performance communication pg ecommerce sales grew at roughly a  rate that jon referred to last fiscal year significantly outpacing offline sales our ecommerce sales now are about or a little over  billion larger than our top three peer competitors combined were committed to winning in this fast growing segment and the last element of superior execution but certainly not the least is winning consumer and customer value equations price is one element of a winning consumer value equation but were really looking at the superior value of the total proposition a product that meets a need in a noticeable and superior way with a package that is convenient to use with compelling communication presented in a clear and shoppable way instore and margin is one element of the customer value equation but so is penny profit trip generation basket size and very importantly market or category growth our best executions generate high returns for our retail partners two great examples of products that are meeting all five of our superiority criteria are dawn and bounty these brands delight consumers with their product performance and packaging their promises to consumers are clear and compelling they look great instore and online and they offer superior value for consumers i can give these two examples but these are two that many several years ago questioned that were in trouble that had a high risk of commoditization and a real concern that private label would take over the paper towel and hand dish category now i had the opportunity to work on the dawn business when i was appointed global home care president in  and many think hand dishwashing detergent is a really high risk of commoditization category ten years later go from  to today dawns value share in the us has grown from  to  and dawns sister brand in the uk fairy has grown from  to around  value share superiority works similarly ive had a pleasure of leading family care in the mids and working on the bounty business paper towels are another category that people often think of as commoditized the fact is that bountys technological advantages and compelling communication have kept it in the market share leader – kept it the market share leader for decades over the last  years despite many challenges from branded and private label competition bounty has consistently maintained or grown value share and where do we stand against these new higher standards of noticeably superior product package and superior execution where a win on all five of these is required for a passing grade we currently earn a passing grade somewhere we said in the s but we are making progress even over the last six months weve seen meaningful progress in the last six months in many areas especially the product area two businesses where were highly focused on improving our competitive position our us male blades and razors and china diapers as you all know in april we took price reductions in the us on male blades and razors to restore a more evenly spaced pricing ladder between our products and to cover key price points where competitors were doing most of the transactions this was one step of several to improve overall consumer value in may we repositioned and relaunched gillette shave care sic gillette shave club  the shave club with gillette ondemand the new online only service that allows consumers to purchase blades whenever they want with free shipping and free of commitments or contracts there are only two pieces of the overall plan while its only one quarter north america shave care grew volume in the apriljune quarter for the first time after eight consecutive quarters of volume declines and one other example i wanted to give is china china diapers china is a critical country for us and china diapers is an important opportunity to restore superiority this is a fast growing highly profitable category where nearly all of the growth is happening at premium price points in both the taped in the pullon diaper forms in january we launched a significant upgrade to pampers premium pullon diapers starting in august weve talked about this many times were launching our new pampers premium taped diapers both of these products are imported into china from japan and carry the message of pampers ichiban our number one choice of japanese hospitals specifically designed to protect your newborn babys delicate skin now to deliver superior instore execution in the baby store channel weve established a dedicated sales force to improve the quality of store coverage and quality of execution in these stores weve improved consumer point of market entry awareness trial and retention with our pampers rewards program and weve strengthened our main line taped and pullon diaper products and packages to unify and premiumize the total pampers line establishing extending product package execution and value superiority represents a significant opportunity to accelerate top line growth this will require investments to realize as some have asked if giving lower market growth rates category commoditization and retail industry transformation we should pick a different path we have made a clear choice we have prioritized the longterm health of the business as the key priority in our minds this would be – if we did the shortterm profit choice itd be the wrong choice in times like this we need to build advantage not diminish it we need to create stronger positions for our brands to drive category growth and capture a disproportionate share of that growth to fund the investment necessary to strengthen our position and extend our advantage we continue raising the bar on productivity the need for investments the external realities we face and our historical productivity progress and our line of sight to additional productivity opportunities all have informed our plans to save up to another  billion from fiscal  through fiscal  this will remain a focus area an important enabler of both top line growth and productivity improvement is building our digital capabilities this also requires investment were leveraging digital tools to improve the consumer experience with our brands skii utilizes a proprietary beauty imaging system that has counters to analyze five dimensions of skin – texture radiance firmness wrinkle resilience and the evenness of skin tone – to help women find exactly the right combination of products for them earlier this year olay announced the global launch of olay skin advisor a new webbased skin analytics platform utilizing a suite of artificial intelligence technologies and it provides women with exceptionally precise personalized skin education and product recommendations on their mobile phones or tablets as i mentioned earlier were improving instore execution with new approaches and technologies like image recognition and machine learning to obtain realtime data on store conditions to optimize our performance and coverage digitization and machine learning are helping us improve the presence of our brands online understanding consumer behavior in areas such as digital search can help us spot important changes in trends that we can use to modify how we present our brands online were using digital tools to synchronize the supply network were working toward an ideal world where our supply chain would be fully linked to realtime pointofsale data with consumer purchases triggering updates to our manufacturing schedules and changes to our orders of materials to our suppliers automation and digitization is driving productivity improvement in our manufacturing operations for example in our mariscala mexico plant weve increased productivity  over the past four years about half of that improvement is driven by digitization programs and work process improvements and the other half is related to automation projects like palletizing robots automated guided vehicles and automated bottle sorting digital tools are making our office work more efficient in our internal audit organization were using desktop auditing and data analytics to focus resources on the highest impact transactions in processes enabling us to reduce staffing while also reducing risk for our company in addition to establishing a new standard of excellence for product performance packaging and commercial execution and continued to drive significant cost savings were further strengthening our organization design culture and accountability deeper mastery closer to consumers and customers more agile more accountable more efficient and more effective we discussed many of our ideas at the analyst meeting last fall and at cagny and weve acted on all of them we continue to move resources out of global or corporate roles into regions and countries learning from innovating for and serving local consumers today a small percentage of commercial function employees including general management marketing sales and finance occupy global roles global category leadership who own endtoend global profit and loss statements are geographically dispersed these few central resources add value by driving scale of manufacturing platforms ensuring consistency of global brand equities and ensuring pricing strategies work across regions regional commercial resources own regional profit and loss statements coordinating innovation across our pipelines and set the pricing and promotion strategy the large majority of marketing sales and finance people reside in local markets executing innovation advertising and merchandising programs leveraging unique local knowledge of consumers customers and competitors in  we worked with an outside consultant on an external benchmarking study to compare pg by functional spending as percent of sales against a set of peer companies this informed choice is to improve function spending as a percent of sales is now on average below the meeting of our benchmark group and its approaching or ahead of the top quartile benchmark in about half the cases our targeted spending by function in  is well below or below the median in every function better than the top quartile benchmark  of the time with some choices to reinvest in functions like rd and sales one specific targeted reduction in the corporate spending area is we continue to redirect resources into the business units to get them closer to the end consumer over the last five years weve reduced corporate roles by  with plans to go further weve eliminated central resources where theyve added complexity but didnt provide a scale benefit overall weve kept some centralized work where it does provide a scale benefit in areas like corporate accounting tax treasury in large markets were implementing what we call an endtoend ownership and accountability approach this new model gives regional category business leaders who own full profit and loss responsibilities holistic decisionmaking authorities starting with the front end of innovation all the way through to the consumer each category decides the resources they need to win category is the point of competition its the point at which consumers engage with our brands we first implemented this endtoend approach giving category leaders full responsibility in the front end of innovation all the way through to the store in the united states in fiscal  we brought four more markets in the model in fiscal  and are adding five more markets this year in total our endtoend markets will account for around  of company sales in smaller countries where we dont have scale to organize in a dedicated endtoend model were implementing a new what we call freedom within a framework approach the objective is to enable these smaller markets to be faster and more agile as long as the market is executing within the predefined strategies and is delivering the financial target set by the region they have the freedom to make real time decisions without the need to engage regional or global resources in the markets where weve tested this approach its enabled us to cut the number of internal review meetings in half reduce the number of people participating in meetings and importantly enhance agility and market responsiveness were launching the freedom within a framework approach in relevant markets globally right now were challenging talent development and career planning – were changing talent development and career planning to drive more mastery and depth in each of our product categories the objective is simple improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win pg is fortunate to consistently source and develop very strong talent but there are times when the best talent for a role may not be within our organization we are supplementing internal development with hiring from the outside to add the skill and experience needed to win and field the best teams our external hiring has roughly quadrupled across five different levels of management including senior line leadership since  weve added external hires to the position of personal healthcare vice president chief information officer chief information security officer head of corporate communications and global media director with additional searches underway we are actively working to create a culture of appropriate risk taking and are aligning incentives at a lower level of granularity to better match responsibilities and to increase accountability were quadrupling the number of bonus units from  to over  to more appropriately align compensation to results delivered related to this change business leaders now have the discretion to adjust awards within their bonus units based on the specific performance versus being paid based on uniform formulas sales professionals in our largest markets who are now dedicated to selling one product category have the majority of their incentive comp tied to the performance of that category versus what was previously a region average across all categories category leaders per region now have their incentive composition tied to the performance of their category in their region versus the global average for that category bottom line again were committed to getting keeping and growing the right people in the right places dedicated to categories to drive better business results were putting more granular incentives in place to match the increased endtoend responsibility were asking leaders to assume were leveraging this talent and mastery in an organization designed to get the best of both focus and agility at the point of competition in categories and markets along with the benefits of pgs scale and cost advantages in areas like global business services purchasing tax treasury and supply network efficiency advantages that none of our individual businesses or sectors could achieve on their own we believe that these three areas that ive talked about this morning irresistible products and package superiority coupled with superior commercial execution fueled by strong productivity improvement and cost savings and supported by an organization that is experienced agile accountable and committed to win will enable us to continue to make progress and accelerate that progress even in the challenging market conditions we currently face now i want to hand it back to jon for a few minutes to discuss the fiscal  guidance jon r moeller  procter  gamble co as context for guidance i think its helpful to look briefly at the macro environment we currently face as we enter the new fiscal year the markets in which we compete as i said earlier are growing at around  to  including an estimate for nontrack channels currencies and commodities continue to be volatile political and economic disruptions continue to have a large impact on markets policy changes such as the goods and services tax implementation on india will put pressure on sales growth many other policy unknowns still exist such as healthcare and tax reforms in the us and execution of brexit which could impact consumers and the company net we continue to face a slow growth volatile world were also investing as david discussed in our future each of these is factored into fiscal  guidance ranges were currently expecting organic sales growth of  to  an incremental improvement versus fiscal  this estimate includes about a quarter point of headwind from the portfolio cleanup in the ongoing businesses it also includes the headwind from the price adjustment on the us blades and razors business made late last fiscal year both of these headwinds will have their biggest impact in the first half of the year and will annualize as the year progresses we expect  allin sales growth of around  this includes a zero to half point net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the india goods and services tax implementation our bottom line guidance is for core earnings per share growth of  to  within this and very importantly we expect core operating profit growth of  to  essentially triple the  core operating profit growth result in fiscal  we expect a net impact of interest expense interest income and other nonoperating income to be a  to point headwind on fiscal  core earnings per share growth we estimate the core effective tax rate will be around  roughly in line with the fiscal  rate share count will be an earnings per share benefit of about  percentage points due to discrete share repurchase and the carryover benefit from the beauty transaction share exchange executed last october we plan to deliver another year of  or better free cash flow productivity this includes capex in the range of  to  of sales well continue our strong track record of cash return to shareholders we increased our dividend as i said earlier for the st consecutive year in april we expect to pay nearly  billion in dividends and repurchase  billion to  billion of our shares in fiscal  foreign exchange and ma could have a notable impact on the ultimate level of share repurchase as we manage the balance sheet to full capacity of our aaminus credit rating our share repurchase range is highly sensitive to currency fluctuations particularly the euro given our euro debt balances every  euro appreciation to the dollar reduces share repurchase capacity by about  billion likewise if we were to make an acquisition we would adjust our share repurchase to maintain our credit metrics at current rates and prices fx is a modest help to fiscal  earnings and commodities are about a  million aftertax headwind significant currency weakness commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range finally as you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earnings estimate please note that the julyseptember period is the most difficult top line comparison of the year underlying market growth was notably stronger in the first half of last fiscal year versus the market were operating in right now july shipments have been relatively weak consistent with the market level data youve seen and reported topline headwinds from the portfolio choices and the gillette price intervention will be focused on the front half of the year and will annualize as the year progresses also keep in mind that productivity savings will build as we progress through the year as a result we expect the first quarter to be our lowest organic sales and core earnings per share growth period of fiscal  with that ill hand it back to david for brief closing comments david s taylor  procter  gamble co as we close fiscal  and enter fiscal  we are where we expected to be were making sequential progress and were raising the bar in everything we do well measure our progress in years not quarters well continue to make the needed reinvestment in innovation brand building and gotomarket to position pg well over the next three years five years seven years and beyond were raising the bar to a higher standard of performance irresistibly superior products and packaging coupled with superior commercial execution fueled by strong cost savings and continued strengthening of our organization and culture this will lead to balanced growth and value creation and winning the total shareholder return the plans weve put in action are delivering improvement we are accelerating our efforts and it takes time to do it right achieving our objectives will not only require continued focus as an organization but also that we prevent anything from derailing the work that is delivering improvement winning results matter they matter to our employees retirees and stakeholders they matter to you our share owners winning results happen because we earn them every day every week every month every quarter and every year in every brand and every country in which we compete were committed to win and well do it within our purpose values and principles which have guided pg for  years we know this is increasingly important to many of our consumers share owners and stake holders who are interested in ensuring our actions and values are worthy of their trust and as a global corporate citizen we have a responsibility to ensure that our business operations positively impact consumers in the broader world well always do it the right way with integrity and with competitive passion jon r moeller  procter  gamble co before we begin the qa portion of the call i just want to remind you that the purpose of todays call is to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year performance and the progress were making through the execution of our strategy wed like to as much as possible keep our conversation focused on those topics and with that well open it up questionandanswer session operator thank you sir your first question comes from the line of stephen powers with ubs stephen r powers  ubs securities llc great thanks david from the results this quarter and your outlook it seems like you feel like youve turned a corner and are starting to build – rebuild momentum which is truly great and it leads to a question what you think it will take to accelerate that momentum further which you started to answer with your discussion of the drive toward sustained superiority but i was listening to you and thinking – and asking this question with two thoughts in mind one is that it feels like more and more superior innovation is occurring on the fringes of the industry as opposed to inside big incumbent operations and two which you started to touch upon is that it feels like much of that new innovation is truly digitally enabled at its core and together those imply that companies like pg need to rapidly retool to keep pace either by investing a lot in new training and toolsets going out and hiring for those capabilities or else choosing to bolt on the capabilities through ma or creative licensing jvs that kind of thing whats your reaction to those observations and do you feel like you can truly retool quickly enough on an organic basis or is there a case to be made that you should look outside to even a greater degree than you already have been either in the form of hiring acquiring new technologies or to jons comments on ma bolting on new complementary brands altogether thanks david s taylor  procter  gamble co i think the answer to that is its a bothand and that theres no question in my mind that we can accelerate growth on our core brands and one of the things that i want to address is at times i keep hearing that big brands cant grow if i look at my top  global brands these billion dollar brands nine of the  grew nicely the last year eight of the  grew faster than the companys average that we just reported which is nice growth in this environment so theres no question that strong innovation on existing big brands can grow head  shoulders has been one of our best successes for years it had another  growth this year oralb brand grew at high single digits you just got a number of examples having said that i think you make very good points and one thing you said we need to increase looking outside or considering external hires i think in many ways people underestimate how much we already do connecting with the outside and the number of conversations were having and things that were doing in some of our upstream innovation programs the reality is its going to be both we can and will innovate on our big brands they are what drove the strong progress this year they grew bigger than – faster than the balance of the company and at the same time we are investing in – to use your term – retooling rapidly in terms of making sure we have the right skills capabilities and people which is why we have increased the number of external hires were increasing our connections with many entrepreneurs and i think you are aware and weve talked before we have both the pg ventures group thats looking for both existing and new spaces to play but with new technologies as well as some internal vc capability weve been working to develop so i think its a bothand and yes i believe that can be done and i believe the progress were making we just need to stay focused and not get distracted and go hard on this path jon r moeller  procter  gamble co and to your point on acquisitions steve i think that increasingly the how to win aspect of strategy will be part of our lens as were looking at potential acquisitions which well continue to do so that is also part of the toolbox operator your next question comes from the line of dara mohsenian with morgan stanley dara w mohsenian  morgan stanley  co llc hey good morning guys so jon first just a detail question can you give us a bit more clarity on how weak organic sales growth could be in q given your july comments is a flash order  possible and was there any timing benefit in q that will come out of q and then the broader question which is also around top line conceptually you guys have really been pointing to fiscal  as the year where you sort of get back on track form an organic sales growth standpoint most of the large organizational changes are in place the sku discontinuations drop off you have the outsized spending behind the coty and duracell share count benefit and now also youve got the benign comparison with the abnormal external issues you cited around the world today jon and the retail inventory cuts in the us over this last fiscal year so given all those factors why do you only expect  to  organic sales growth in fiscal  and does that really signal that the ultimate payoff from all these areas is unlikely to move pg above that  to  range longer term i guess to put it simply are you now a structurally lower top line growth company more in that  to  range jon r moeller  procter  gamble co so ill give you a point of view on the second point but im sure david will have some thoughts there as well relative to q i dont expect it – i expect growth in q but that growth to be very modest given all the dynamics that weve talked about in terms of growth next year  to  represents acceleration from the year that we were just in in a period where market growth if it stays at todays levels is going to be lower than it was over that whole period and that  to  effectively straddles what we expect market growth to be our objective is to build market share within that and to the extent that market growth rebounds or is stronger i would expect our results to reflect that longer term my personal view is that there are significant opportunities for growth that remain weve talked before about increasing populations and increasing income increase of middle income households were going to see a bigger increase in those drivers of consumer products business in the next decade albeit with some turbulence then likely weve ever seen before we have significant household penetration opportunities david alluded to in his remarks on winning products only  of washes in the us using beads only – household penetration of the unitdose detergents only  so i do think that theres a future of growth strongly in front of us i dont think that its realistic to expect that were going to grow orders of magnitude faster than the overall market however david david s taylor  procter  gamble co the only thing id add to that is i clearly see the company having the capability to grow ahead of the market over time were within the head  of the market just as jon said and no i do not believe were structurally a slower growing company i think if anything the things that weve done over the last several years have positioned us to be more agile and more able to take advantage of new opportunities in markets and the changes were making in our innovation capability also give me confidence that we can now see some of those opportunities better than we may have been able to in the past the combination of the lean innovation in all  categories that is starting to pay off and over time i think will build capability along with the investments were making in new jobs to be done which has opened up some new problem areas – or places we can play that i think will be additive to what weve been doing over the last several years and then this new and its very early some of the work were doing with some small problem spaces that have very large addressable markets gives me a lot of belief that theres a bright future so if anything im more excited and i think this year was a really challenging year to make the progress we did through the year and the organization is very quickly learning to get from very structured to a very flexible agile accountable organization small teams learn pivot learn act and to me that just tells me were actually wellpositioned and youve seen and weve referred to in our remarks were doing very well in the online space which is rapidly growing both with pure plays and existing bricks and mortar that are really turning into effective omni retailers and pg is working very effectively across all channels but weve opened up our field of vision to see – to be many more opportunities and were organizing our company to be able to take advantage of them so im actually quite excited about what the future holds operator your next question comes from the line of wendy nicholson with citi research wendy c nicholson  citigroup global markets inc hi two questions the first one on grooming if i may with the price cut you took your margins have come way down and im just wondering specifically to the grooming business what is going to take those margins back up over time because thats been such a margin accretive segment for you relative to the overall business im just wondering if thats been a permanent reset or if there are specific things you can do outside of taking prices back up thatll make that more profitable and then second of all just quickly david on your comment about benchmarking clearly you benchmarked yourself relative to peers and other companies with regard to your cost structure but have you done benchmarking with regard to your speedtomarket or timetomarket because when we were in china recently we were so impressed by what we heard about the diaper launch it looks like its set up to be incredibly impactful fingers crossed but it also feels like its taken a really long time to get to market and listening to you talk about how much work all the research all that kind of stuff that youre doing it feels like theres maybe a risk that theres sort of paralysis of analysis or something but maybe thats an unfair characterization so can you comment on that thanks david s taylor  procter  gamble co sure wendy let me hit both of them first on grooming to me the path to build the business both in sales and profits is to bring users back in and then to have products in each of the ladders that consumers see as better and so they move up the ladder the trade up model works weve seen it over a long period of time what we did not do as good a job as we needed to in the us is bringing new users in and so we lost a lot of household penetration we werent planning to keep price points and we had reduced our spending on some of the point of market entry programs we made a big investment some of it in price some of it in the point of market entry programs and you saw the volume response and well see over the next year as we continue to invest in bringing users in and then well do what we know how to do which is once one gets into one of the various places you can enter the gillette franchise well work to then expose them to better options and higher performing options and trade up is the best way to build margins over time and frankly as you move people from disposables into systems and then into – more frequent use of cartridges good things happen so yeah and we – because were seeing it in other parts of the world the us is particularly challenged because of a set of dynamics weve talked where we had missing rungs in our price ladder you can look at other parts of the world and its continuing to perform very well so again i see the grooming business as attractive weve got work to do and this year will be a challenging year and weve been very open about it and were addressing it on the speed question we are actually in many ways getting faster and it depends on what dimension you look at when you look at things that require capital expenditures and building capacity it does take time your cutting metal and putting equipment in place in the case of baby care the design of the product may be done relatively quick but then having the capacity to make them perfectly a few hundred million times you have to have equipment and you have to have a process and you have to have material supply and that for us and many does take time and if anything were getting much more efficient in that as weve done our endtoend work on synchronizing our supply chain where we can and are getting much faster is on things that arent heavy capital investments packaging changes and other formulation changes and some of the new platforms give us much better agility and when i talk about the number of different research tools – and ill reference a meeting ill have later this week which is we can do research in days and weeks and months not quarters and years so many of these tools are ones where you dont have to go out and place a large based research at a mall and bring people back weeks later weve done online today and ill have the read on monday and you can act on tuesday and thats what were getting to is leveraging the digital ecosystem to access large groups of consumers learn pivot learn pivot and then act when you get into cutting metal yes it takes longer and were working on simplifying that part of the system as well but we clearly have internalized the need to have a flexible agile and much faster organization and upping the accountability while we do that operator and your next question comes from the line ali dibadj with bernstein ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc hey guys so i wanted to test some of your energized and eloquent prepared remarks versus some data from your results so the first one – two things the first one is despite you sort of under emphasizing lower price as a tool if you look at your results on a categorybycategory basis youve decided to either take prices down like grooming oral care baby or raise prices now that youve seen some results less than your key competitors so for a company like yours that says its intent on growing the category certainly in innovation understanding its not always premiumization but innovation why that strategy how do you think your competitors will respond and is this a good sustainable strategy going forward i guess the underlying question i always have is how much are you to blame for the category slowdown and then the second point is to quote you david from your prepared remarks if your standards are high if you want to be the best why is it that you set this target and i think get paid on the target of only performing in the top third of peers when you have so many advantages youre going through this great transformation and frankly youve historically done much better than that youve really historically done much better than your peers why is that not the case now why this onethird thanks for both of those jon r moeller  procter  gamble co well let me just provide some data as it relates to the first question and then david can talk more about the approach and the thinking if you look at price as a component of top line growth to this notion that broadly on aggregate were leading prices down price was neutral as an element of top line growth for both the quarter and the year its been neutral to positive for  consecutive quarters and  consecutive years so the notion that were leading pricing down on a broad basis isnt consistent with the data we will as we need to be competitive and to address the point of winning value equations make moves as we need to but generally the direction again is not student body down david s taylor  procter  gamble co and just i guess a couple comments on the top third i think performing and delivering results in the top third over time through ups and downs is a very good place to be for our company it means youre one of the best amongst the very best in your industry across the world youre competing with a number of competitors that are domiciled in different countries over time and at the same time weve made a commitment and certainly weve delivered consistent returns to shareholders via dividends and weve got a pretty good track record of increasing the dividend so the idea of having a company that you can count on over time – and this is why i think its a good goal – that delivers very good total shareholder return in the form of appreciation and cash return to shareholders is a very good objective and i think our share owners will be rewarded as we deliver that and thats what were working very hard to get back to the top third and then stay there over time jon r moeller  procter  gamble co one other thing ali and the group on pricing and on understanding whats happening in the marketplace as weve talked before were in a little bit of a difficult environment for you to effectively assess whats really happening and i just want to address that for a second and thats because we have our pricing strategy but the ultimate price that consumers pay is at the sole discretion of our retail partners and thats what youre picking up in the scanner data and the nielsen data that you see and so there are instances where if you look at period to period or versus year ago price moves it would appear that a price reduction has occurred in many many cases thats not us reducing that price so just a little bit technical but i wanted to make sure i registered that point operator your next question comes from the line of lauren lieberman with barclays lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc thanks good morning id like to talk a little bit about implementation of endtoend i think in north america were kind of at a twoyear point for that being put in place and i understand it was the lead markets there was going to be a lot of learning and adjusting but it looks like youre still – share trends are still clearly not where they need to be in the us so two years in could you maybe talk a little bit about whats worked whats been tougher than you thought if there have been sort of impediments to seeing changed behavior and people understanding that theyve got that autonomy and ability to do things differently i think just a real time kind of status report two years in where numerically its not clicking but that doesnt mean its not the right direction to move in thanks david s taylor  procter  gamble co yeah its a fair question first im very convinced endtoend is a much more effective and agile operating model because it has a very clear choice on how youre going to organize and the g view or  the regional business unit that runs in north america today has line of sight and now has – and its increasing over time building the capability to understand the consumer build a relationship with the customer and building category mastery and take north america the us and canada and weve had a little more challenges in the us this year because of a lot of welldocumented things that are going on in the marketplace and i think if you see not only us many other competitors our results still are making progress what i see – i just came from canada yesterday i spent a day in the market a year ago or  months ago we had  of our brands growing share today we have  of our brands growing share i didnt hear one comment around part of the organization saying you need to help with another part of the organization there was a very clear focus on addressing either consumer or a customer challenge that is existing in the marketplace or how to best execute a new initiative coming the effectiveness of the current organization is meaningfully better and i do believe it will show over time strong results weve got a couple big issues that were addressing in the us the biggest is probably the gillette issue it weighs pretty heavy on the market were going to have to work through that and annualize that and a couple other categories that we have some long standing issues that were working through weve talked in the past about skin weve talked in the past about some of the things on hair and one by one were addressing those head  shoulders is growing herbal essences is showing progress we still got work to do on pantene so again making progress but not yet where we want to be in all the businesses and the other thing its a very competitive market with not only a lot of competitors but also some pretty dynamic things happening on the retail front but from an organization standpoint i clearly see improved operation and i clearly see the effectiveness we hoped to see on the way we work and now its got to translate – and i believe it will over time – to more consistent strong results jon r moeller  procter  gamble co and to that point while theres still more work to do about twothirds of our us sales base is holding or growing share currently that compares to  a year ago so again continued improvement pretty strong volume progress in the year we just completed in the us at   in the quarter we just completed so as david rightly said work still to do but we are seeing that sustained improvement david s taylor  procter  gamble co and the other market just lauren to make a comment that we started a little while back and is part way into it is china and its another one where the breadth is a really good indication we had two categories growing share – or growing sales even  months ago and now weve got six in the last quarter another one went so seven of the  we were minus five in  were plus one in  and other than baby that weve been very open about it was plus four so youve seen a meaningful change and again when im there what you see is the category one having the decision space to move at the speed of the market and secondly you see choices being made the wouldnt have been made several years ago the baby care is a good example the endtoend team there on baby care said ive got to cover the baby channel im going to need to hire  people or get distributors to cover the decision was made by the category yes yes mode has helped to execute it acquired the people and developed the capability and its happening though minus five to plus one in a tough market plus four exbaby thats a really good indication volume is up in the us and then canada doubling the percent of the business growing share those are indications and certainly the behavior i see gives me a lot of confidence this is one of the parts that really is working and over time i think itll play out in more consistent strong results jon r moeller  procter  gamble co and just for completeness it was implied in davids comments but china was one of the four markets that we went endtoend in last year david s taylor  procter  gamble co yes jon r moeller  procter  gamble co so that the result does reflect that choice operator your next question comes from the line of nik modi with rbc capital markets nik modi  rbc capital markets llc yeah thanks good morning everyone david thanks for providing the color you did on how pg has enhanced the way that it evaluates new products in the pipeline but i was hoping you can share some context on if youve made any changes on how you actually source or ideate around those products or around the innovation pipeline so in terms of how you actually come up with the concepts versus actually evaluating the concepts if you can provide some context that would be helpful david s taylor  procter  gamble co ill just give you a couple comments and again theres a pretty wide range by category but we have certainly all the traditional measures but we now are accessing many more external ideas than before in that all of the businesses in the latitude to both work with internal stake holders but also to look at and engage where they see either technologies or even potentially other opportunities to add that are outside our company until something happens we certainly wouldnt announce it but as both ive mentioned and jon has mention well be active managers of the portfolio and so ideas are coming both inside and outside the ideation to me is broad the spaces that were innovating are more and then the path to kind of whittle down lots of ideas to whats right for the market to me is getting faster all those things i feel very good about the part that i think is though absolutely important to reinforce is growing the core and building on the core is what will give us the momentum that i think well all be pleased with and then adding to that and thats why both the frontend innovation that were doing within our categories where were using this lean innovation approach which is generating a lot of ideas once you identify a problem we source a lot of ideas and then can go through them much faster but then weve added this pgv pg ventures and this additional corporate capability thats looking at new spaces that arent in the  categories that are sourcing ideas that then can be put in the category if its adjacent or pursued independently so were not suffering for lack of ideas and now the challenge is to process and then learn enough to develop models the other thing – the last thing ill say on this is we have several transaction learning tests going on some have been public many are not where were trying new things as well so again the number of both ideas and spaces neat spaces that were playing in is robust operator your next question comes from the line of olivia tong with bank of america merrill lynch olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you just getting back to the outlook going from  to  to  it sounds like macros market growth more or less in line with where its been so do you have more initiatives hitting the market or an expectation for a better hit rate on the plans that you have so i guess a better understanding of the key things embedded in your expectations as you look for that acceleration and then clearly this was a better than anticipated quarter and quite a bit better than your peers so i guess how do you ensure consistency in growth over time so that you dont fall back into this cycle of kind of ups and downs booms and busts especially given all the dynamics in the market right now theres heavier competition theres retail pressures that you talked about still somewhat shaky macros in emerging markets and things like that thank you david s taylor  procter  gamble co a guess a couple things on why do we think well grow from here in shaky macros and theres no question the environment is difficult right now but weve got many many pieces of evidence that when we get the innovation right it works one of the areas thats big enough to mention is baby care china getting that right will make an enormous difference we had and have had several years of well below market growth on a category thats growing above  and so when we launch – and certainly well work hard to earn share growth in that category – thats going to move several points to china and will be meaningful to the company weve got a few other areas when we annualize the gillette investment that is meaningful on the top of that weve made some choices that are in the base this year that jon had referred to in previous remarks that we will be annualizing we decided to get out of some pieces of businesses that just did not look profitable and would not create value over time the powders business laundry powder business in brazil well annualize that as we end this calendar year so its the absence of some of the negatives and several of the innovations need to hit baby care is one of them addressing gillette we have some very exciting innovation coming on skin care and hair care and one of the encouraging points is some of the early work in china olay grew in the back half of our fiscal year for the first time in a long time in china which is to me a nice leading indicator of the work were doing both instore the way we present the brand the packaging changes that have been made and some of the new innovation thats hitting so i look at some of the categories that have been drags and weve got really strong plans i fully expect them to be highly competitive categories in difficult macro environment but i think we can earn improved growth from where we are today and well continue to push on making sure that were agile enough to address to whatever happens in the external world the organization is certainly better prepared to deal with whatever comes at them with the accountability clear and more decisions based closer to the consumer so i think were well positioned to deal with a pretty volatile world jon r moeller  procter  gamble co and just a couple of pieces of mathematical perspective if you will im encouraged by a couple things one is that the  growth we delivered in the quarter ends a  growth for the year and so its not just one quarter weve been growing at that rate we delivered over  growth and within that as we talked theres a half a point of portfolio cleanup and the gillette pricing that david talked about had about a  basis point impact on the total company you add something like addressing the china diaper situation which david just talked about and pretty soon – and i certainly dont want to talk our numbers up but pretty soon youre at  just with that math now as david rightly said as those things go right we will have some things thatll go wrong and well be dealing with the challenges that our world faces but i feel pretty comfortable with the behavioral changes that david talked about the product strengthening that we spent both last call and this call talking about and the annualization of some of the headwinds operator your next question comes from the line of bill chappell with suntrust william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks good morning just to follow up on the grooming i think youd said david that you did see volume growth for the first time in nine quarters but i guess is that – was the level of growth what you were looking for and i mean do you expect it to accelerate as we kind of move through the year and im just trying to understand so far i realize its only two months three months into it have you gotten what you thought out of this and would you look to do anything like this to any other categories around the world or is this really just very very specific david s taylor  procter  gamble co okay bill let me just give a couple quick comments and ill try to address that last one which is much broader the answer to did we get what we expected in amj aprilmayjune in the us the answer is yes the volume response was as we modeled maybe a little bit better actually but its early and so im not going to for a second declare victory we dont even have the full plan in the market we had part of it executed certainly the price change at some of our major customers did drop but theres additional actions that will take place over this six months to go ahead and get the rest of the plan in the market the portfolio right the packaging right and the gotomarket programs we couldnt affect all of that immediately the one we could do quickest is the price change to address some of the points on the ladder that were missing so were in early stages of a very important investment in a very important category and i cant predict whatll happen but i can tell you that the early indications are positive the fact that the user growth is back up the volume is moving up and were getting very good support from our retail partners they see the opportunity and they also understand gillette is the only one that can build value in this category gillette is the only one that has a history over time of creating value in this category so getting it right getting the consumers back in i wont try to predict societal trends theres other things that do play in the results in any quarter six months or even year but what we want if we can bring more consumers in and they see and appreciate the superior experience you have with gillette no matter where you come in relative to the best alternative in that price tier then i think were wellpositioned to win over time and we do see consumers trade up because there are meaningful advantages as you move up from a twoblade disposable to a mach and a mach to a fusion proglide and then proshield so yes were making good progress and its very early days this can be better addressed probably in the early part of calendar  after we had six months and get the full plan in place the second question will we have to do something like this on other brands we will have to one understand where the consumers go and then secondly the market will change whats clear today and weve now got much better early warning systems out there is there will be many competitive actions small from small and large companies and i think were doing a better job seeing those and in many times – and theres many of those many will not be big threats some will be but what we need to do is cover spaces where consumers or shoppers go and that includes channels and benefit areas each of the  categories now are designing an organization thats better in touch in the big markets with whats going on i think well catch many of them earlier and if we really do our job right we create the new trends because our innovation is ahead of where the consumers see the need we provide an opportunity that they really like and again i think the organization design and the agility and accountability im now seeing tells me were at least better positioned to deal with a volatile world operator your next question comes from the line of andrea teixeira with jpmorgan andrea f teixeira  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning thank you so given your strong performance in the first quarter how are you thinking about retailers willingness to build inventory levels again do think the large destocking that youve seen through fiscal  is largely behind you at this point and then if you – in your organic growth guidance you mentioned the back end loaded given the tough comp in the first quarter is that primarily because you were seeing the international trends getting better or the comp being tougher in the first quarter so if you can break down em and dm embedded in your guidance and related to that in terms of your spending to grow in terms of thinking – as embedded in your guidance also for fiscal year  its pretty conservative in my view in terms of how youre going to spend – youre going to have the trade spend funded into more rational add spend so what you saw here in the fourth quarter was like you cut and then quoted as temporary so can you help us bridge this guidance in terms of sga spend as well thank you so much jon r moeller  procter  gamble co sure first of all in terms of retail inventories i mean were working hard with our retail partners to ensure availability on shelf within that were very supportive of lower inventories systemically across the value chain and a number of our product supply initiatives are designed to enable both ourselves and our retail partners to carry lower inventories so were not expecting a big acceleration in inventories that retailers are currently holding but were going to continue to work on availability at shelf some of our supply initiatives have enabled us to increase that significantly in north america as an example where weve gone to the mixing centers we now have about  of our product line we can get to a store shelf within  hours of an order and as a result our customer service levels have improved significantly getting close to   levels of service on the spending question weve talked about the need to invest in product package communication shelf and occasionally in the value equation so you should assume that were going to do that in the fourth quarter the reduction in marketing that occurred was almost all in the digital space and what it reflected was a choice to cut spending from a digital standpoint where it was ineffective where either we were serving bots as opposed to human beings or where the placement of ads was not facilitating the equity of our brands importantly as we made those decisions and put our money where our mouth has been in terms of the need to increase the efficiency of that supply chain ensure solid and strong placement of individual ads we didnt see a reduction in the growth rate so as you know we delivered over  organic sales growth on  volume growth in the quarter and that what that tells me is that that spending that we cut was largely ineffective what wed love to do and what were working with our media partners to do is create a very efficient supply chain that helps us build our brands and wed love to invest more in doing just that operator the next question comes from the line of bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc good morning you guys mentioned some interest in ma this morning but this would really be the first time in years that youve purchased something since youve really been in selling and consolidating mode so id love it if you could drill down a little further on why now and then why you would only look to acquire – or would you only look to acquire something in your existing categories or would you be willing to expand into another category and then maybe finally if you could just remind us of your criteria for acquisitions that would be helpful thanks david s taylor  procter  gamble co why dont i give a comment or two and then jon will add a comment first we went through – youre absolutely right we went through a very big process the last several years going from almost  brands down to  but what we said and we really mean it is when we closed on october  the coty deal all  categories needed to be in a position to grow they needed to deliver results and grow and it starts with very strong organic growth building from the base and i think weve got really good evidence that that is possible when you see the top  brands driving your growth and growing above the market which is good evidence that were starting to see our innovation programs working on top of that i think it makes perfect sense and weve made the decision to say well be active managers so all  of the presidents as well as the company looking at spaces outside the  core categories that were active now we wont do anything until we see something that we think can create value and leverages the core capabilities of this company weve learned a lot with the process the round trip that we went through over the last  years on buying another – a number of brands and companies and selling them so part of the things – part of the screen that we used is learning from what worked and didnt work but clearly we see the opportunity to acquire potentially new technologies capabilities or potentially companies in spaces that are in our existing  core categories are adjacent or ones that leverage our capabilities that is active today for the company jon r moeller  procter  gamble co and there will be a couple other screens that we – that would complement that search and to the extent that we can be in categories and that can be beyond the  categories that were currently operating in where daily – where products are consumed daily or even more than one time per day those are categories we really like categories where a product is used or consumed once or twice or three times a year are not as attractive by definition we want to be in categories where product superiority matters where purchase motivation is driven by the ability of a product to meet a need in a demonstrable way its not that theyre bad businesses but a large part of the choice in businesses we got out of was that purchase intent was driven by something other than that fashion flavors fragrance selfimage all good things but not up our power alley so were going to stay as david said very focused on the kinds of things that we know we can do well in but there are lots of those operator your next question comes from the line of jason english with goldman sachs jason english  goldman sachs  co hey guys good morning thank you for squeezing me in ive got two questions and im just going to kind of spew them out because i know i dont get a second chance first i wanted to understand guidance and the implicit reinvestment into next year i think you said around  to  bottom line  points is share repo getting us to a sort of  to  pretax on  growth that doesnt imply much margin especially in context of i think you said commodities posttax only  million thats kind of benign for a company your size so is it right to assume that this implies a lot of reinvestment in productivity if so kind of what shape what form and where if you can elaborate on that and secondly on business units youre right the focus for a long time on underperformance has been sort of beauty and grooming but looking at baby fem and family growth has been quite sluggish for a couple years pretax profit down and obviously were fresh off of kimberly results yesterday both of you really seem to be struggling what does that say about the environment for those businesses baby tissue products et cetera both in the near term and over the medium to long term thank you jon r moeller  procter  gamble co jason ill take the first one of those as i said in my prepared remarks were expecting to increase operating profit growth from  this year to  to  next year and in terms of all the pieces and the builds id encourage you to work with john chevalier through the course of the day and he can help you with that but against sales growth of  to  that obviously implies operating margin progress and weve been very clear or tried to be that the only sustainable model for value creation in this industry is balanced top line and bottom line growth with margin a part of that david s taylor  procter  gamble co and let me give just  one comment about you singled out the paper businesses as particularly challenging two of our three paper businesses grew ahead of the category – ahead of the company so family care grew share grew nicely and thats our tissue towel business and fem care grew ahead of the balance of the company baby care was challenged and weve been very open about china we had a very difficult year growing well below the market and so that has depressed the baby care results but when we get it right and the fem care i gave you a couple examples of the superpremium innovation that we have and some of the work frankly weve done on cotton top sheets around the world were seeing fem care respond nicely and its now starting to turn in share growth globally and family care is growing share as well and growing sales and growing profit and a very strong total shareholder return if i look at that individual business so and whats interesting about both of those whats driving them is innovation well executed in market period operator your next question comes from the line of kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy  jefferies llc thanks good morning guys david s taylor  procter  gamble co morning kevin kevin grundy  jefferies llc david i wanted to come back to your online strategy so within the context theres considerable worry i would say in the market about narrowing of competitive moats as consumers migrate online where the barriers to entry are lower you have amazon which has expressed an appetite and is investing behind its own private label brands so and then weve also talked about some worry about commoditization of product categories with some of the trade spending thats going on et cetera so as you consider these factors and then naturally the fact that online will become a bigger portion of everyones channel mix i have three questions opportunities and risks the larger ones as you see it would be number one number two do you see any further opportunities to expand upon directtoconsumer capabilities maybe beyond just outside of blades and then the third piece sort of notwithstanding blades where your market share is naturally going to be lower given the success of harrys and dollar shave club maybe you could talk a little bit about market share positioning and trends as you see them relative to what we can observe in brick and mortar thank you david s taylor  procter  gamble co very good all good questions a couple comments one just a broad comment about it – about this space because ive got it many many times saying the low barrier to entry and the number of brands that come at you presents a big threat to pg and pgs great brands and weve talked often about endless shelf if anything online consumers look at less brands than more brands walk a store at a big mass merchandiser and some big categories like hair care you may say    brands when you go to any one of the online opportunity sources youll probably look at page one maybe page two and as i mentioned strong brands often occupy the majority of page one and page two so actually i think were well positioned and brands that are meaningfully better and strong tend to do well and our online business is actually growing well and growing well in both sales and share one of the things that i think is going to be critical to win online and it may be even more so is the level of superiority because that then drives you to be getting both the discussion in social media as well as the movement that drives you up the various online companies algorithms and then the commoditization comment that you make i give the same response i did when people talked about it in tissuetowel in  and in any of a number of categories commoditization in my mind is – it occurs when we dont innovate or build brands in all of the categories weve chosen theres a real benefit that makes a difference in consumers lives if we can provide a differential benefit thats much better than the next best then i think were well positioned and maybe even better positioned online because of the limited selection because most people do by habit go to page one page two now specifically on some of your questions one of them that i get asked a lot should pg go directtoconsumer and the question is we are testing and have tested and will continue to test a number of models including a company store including working on a variety of things from working with our omni retailers and pure plays and everything in between weve got a directwithconsumer model which says we will build a relationship with the consumer well do diagnostics weve got a good example with olay skin advisor well gather information about our users so that we can serve them well communicate and own a relationship that somebody else may fulfill but certainly our belief so far is that most consumers do not want to have a lot more accounts for narrow parts of their daily or monthly needs and so an aggregator probably is better positioned to serve the consumer what we do want to do is have a superior product and a relationship with the consumer so that we can communicate with them appropriately and were doing some very interesting and very promising tests in categories like baby care and skin care with building very strong relationships and a lot of access to names that i think will serve us very well so its more the relationship with the consumer but we will concern and learn i dont if anybody knows the full answer to this question but right now i believe that were best positioned to go through aggregators and then on market share trends were generally doing positive its been – and ill take the most competitive market in the world in this space which is china where our business just passed  billion we grew share online which is to me a very very positive sign and on a few of our categories our online share is now above our offline share not true in many categories but in a few thats now happened so that also bodes well for the future jon r moeller  procter  gamble co and if you look at it in aggregate our market shares online are about equal to our market shares offline as david rightly said that differs by category and channel and importantly another topic in this space our margins on aggregate are about equal online and offline to the point of the difference in growth rates between the online channels which are harder for you to see and the tracked channels in both the us and china which are the fastest growing or largest online markets our growth in both of those countries was  in the most recent period so it is driving a meaningful difference between what youre observing in the tracked channel data and what our allin sales growth actually is operator and your final question comes from the line of faiza alwy with deutsche bank faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc yes hi good morning so i just wanted to expand a little bit more on your comment regarding digital marketing it feels like youre rethinking what marketing really means and how to communicate with consumers especially with the new generation of millennial consumers so could you – like is that right and it feels like overall the way we think about marketing as advertising is potentially going to be down this year so could you confirm that and just elaborate a little bit more about how you think – what is the best way to communicate with consumers jon r moeller  procter  gamble co yeah david s taylor  procter  gamble co a couple comments certainly we are and have been rethinking marketing in that it will evolve but i think the key is building the relationship with the consumer and communicating the full range of benefits of your brand in a way that makes a difference to the consumer how we do that has changed what were trying to do i dont think has changed a lot we now use a variety of different channels and certainly social medial has exploded in its importance there will be those that talk about not only the zero first and second moment of truth but even after the inhome usage experience now theres another moment you have to worry about which is what consumers say about you in social media on instagram or facebook or any variety of different vehicles and i think thats true which is all the more reason why you both have to have a superior product but also communicate it in a way and the brand has to stand for something its one of the reasons why i believe campaigns like the like a girl some of you may have seen the ariel share the load we ran in india or the skii marriage market campaign have really resonated with consumers because theyve gone beyond just communicating that the brand is superior but the brand has a point of view and its one that sparks conversations about things that matter and so thats beyond what id say traditional marketing of communicating the benefit of your brand its having an equity and equity that matters and each of our brands is thinking through what that looks like and then finding the smart and appropriate way to communicate that to the consumer when and where theyre receptive to the message so that its less of an intrusion its more giving them things that help them understand the brand and make informed choices and that part i think is working well the brands that do it best are the ones that are growing jon r moeller  procter  gamble co we need to stop here we need to get on with delivering another above objective year i know we didnt get to everybody i apologize for that i also know its a busy day for you and i want to thank you for the time with us this morning ill just turn it over to david for some quick closing remarks and then john and i are available in the balance of the day david s taylor  procter  gamble co yes one i want to thank everybody for participating today and let you know that we do see

publishes a list of top selling new products based on their firstyear salespg typically has three to five launches that make the iri new product pacesetters list this year it had five products with combined firstyear sales of  million“we’re proud that these innovations from gillette tide crest tampax and old spice earned pg five of the top  spots – and seven of the top ” said pg spokesman jeff leroy “these successful product launches underscore pg’s commitment to creating innovative irresistibly superior products that delight consumers and drive category growth”it’s the second time in the last three years that five pg products made the top  but it’s also lowest revenue total from its bestperforming launches since  when the company had three products in the pacesetters top  with combined revenue of  million iri said all brands are finding it tougher to rack up big firstyear sales totals thanks to digital marketing strategies that make it easier for smaller companies to grab market share“the brands in the middle of the pack are getting the squeeze as smaller more targeted brands capture a growing share of pacesetter dollar sales” said iri’s report “across topselling  brands  percent of top launches earned  to  million in yearone sales by  that figure had fallen sharply to just  percent of brands”pg has been talking about this trend in recent conference calls where it told wall street analysts it planned to reduce prices by up to  percent on gillette razors“for the last two years weve been losing users in the mid and value tiers of the us blades and razors business” chief financial officer jon moeller said feb   “this is where most competitive products from both longtime branded competitors and new entrants are playing well soon be making pricing interventions to better position our brands at all levels of the pricing ladder”even though it lost market share to upstarts like dollar shave club pg’s best product launch in  was the gillette fusion pro shield which ranked second on the pacesetters list with  million in firstyear sales here are the rest of pg’s top five launches tide pods plus febreze ranked fourth with  million in sales crest prohealth advanced mouthwash ranked fifth generating  million tampax pocket pearl reached  in firstyear sales and ranked ninth old spice fresher collection finished th with  million in firstyear sales

consumer products giant pg posts its fiscal q earnings thursday demitrios kalogeropoulos tmfsigma jul   at am procter  gamble nysepg will close the books on its  fiscal year this week when it releases quarterly earnings before the market opens on thursday here are a few trends to keep an eye out for in the report image source getty images market share pg has had a disappointing sales growth run lately in fact its market share fell in each of its core product categories over the past nine months the most painful dip has been in grooming where the gillette franchise is taking a hit from valuebased store brands and disruptive online offerings such as unilevers nyseul dollar shave club organic growth in the grooming segment has been flat so far this year as a  uptick in volume was completely offset by lower prices  overall pg is on track to expand sales by about  the good news is that result would represent a doubling of the prior years pace on the other hand its slightly lower than the company had targeted earlier in the year its also consistent with falling  or at best flat  market share unilever for example is growing organic sales at a  clip right now costs the consumer products giant cant do much about a sluggish global industry so management is putting a lot of focus on reducing costs after generating  billion worth of savings since  pg has plans to axe a further  billion from its expense infrastructure over the next five fiscal years the changes have helped push operating margin up by two full percentage points and put pg near the front of its peer group in terms of profitability pg operating margin ttm data by ycharts rivals are closing the gap though unilevers operating margin has jumped higher this year to put the company ahead of its longterm plan to reach  profitability by  and unlike pg the company has achieved that expansion while also boosting its market share cash returns and outlook it turns out pg executives were being modest when they described fiscal  as a year of significant value return to shareholders thanks to a mix of aggressive cost cuts improving foreign currency exchange rates and the cash raised from selling off big chunks of its portfolio the company has found itself flush with excess funds it is returning most of that bounty to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases with a smaller portion allotted to modestly growing the dividend altogether the company will have delivered  billion to its investors over the past twelve months for a huge increase over its traditional return pace however now that pg is done with its brandshedding initiative management must rely more on earnings growth to fund such cash returns that puts the pressure back on sales gains over the coming years the uptick in organic growth that pg has managed this year will be a good start but its not enough as the company explained in its k it needs to expand its sales base at a faster rate than the industry in order to produce healthy earnings growth and cash flow gains it has been several years since the company has achieved that core marketshare goal if pgs organic sales growth outlook implies another year of weak results

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
