on march    assumes  first street nw and  gaither road at redland are placed into redevelopment during  and the square footage associated with the properties is excluded from reported portfolio metrics including occupancy  assumes  first street nw and  gaither road at redland are placed into redevelopment during  resulting in the properties being excluded from the fullyear  same property noi calculation our guidance is also based on a number of other assumptions many of which are outside our control and all of which are subject to change we may change our guidance as actual and anticipated results vary from these assumptions guidance range for  low range high range net income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share     real estate depreciation   net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and items excluded     from core ffo per diluted share   core ffo per diluted share      includes our prorata share of depreciation from our unconsolidated

selfadministered selfmanaged real estate investment trust that focuses on owning operating developing and redeveloping office and business park properties in the greater washington dc region  fpo common shares nyse fpo are publicly traded on the new york stock exchange  as of march   our consolidated portfolio totaled  million square feet based on annualized cash basis rent our portfolio consists of  office properties and  business park properties a key element of first potomacs overarching strategy is its dedication to sustainability over one million square feet of first potomac property is leed certified and over half of the portfolios multistory office square footage is leed or energy star certified   nongaap financial measures funds from operations  funds from operations ffo which is a nongaap measure used by many investors and analysts that follow the public real estate industry represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains losses on sales of rental property and impairments of rental property plus real estaterelated depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we also exclude from our ffo calculation the impact related to third parties from our consolidated joint venture  ffo available to common shareholders and unitholders is calculated as ffo less accumulated dividends on our preferred shares for the applicable periods presented  we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo or similarly titled measures utilized by other equity reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits we consider ffo and ffo available to common shareholders and unitholders useful measures of performance for an equity real estate investment trust reit as they facilitate an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization which assume that the value of rental property diminishes predictably over time since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions we believe that ffo provides a meaningful indication of our performance we also consider ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure given its wide use by investors and analysts however ffo does not represent amounts available for our discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions our methodology for computing ffo adds back noncontrolling interests in the income from our operating partnership in determining ffo we believe this is appropriate as common operating partnership units are presented on an asconverted oneforone basis for common shares in determining ffo per diluted share our presentation of ffo in accordance with nareits definition should not be considered as an alternative to net loss income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance core ffo  we believe that the computation of ffo in accordance with nareits definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our periodoverperiod performance these items include but are not limited to gains and losses on the retirement of debt personnel separation costs contingent consideration charges acceleration of deferred abatement and straightline amortization gains on the receipt of yield maintenance payments from the prepayment of a note receivable issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares and acquisition costs core ffo is presented less accumulated dividends on our preferred shares for all the periods presented our presentation of core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net loss income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  our ffo and core ffo calculations are reconciled to loss income attributable to common shareholders in this release same property noi  same property net operating income same property noi defined as property revenues rental and tenant reimbursements and other revenues less property operating expenses real estate taxes property operating and insurance expenses from the consolidated properties owned by us and inservice for the entirety of the periods presented is a primary performance measure we use to assess the results of operations at our properties  same property noi is a nongaap measure  as an indication of our operating performance same property noi should not be considered an alternative to net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap  a reconciliation of our same property noi to net income is presented below  the same property noi results exclude the collection of termination fees as these items vary significantly periodoverperiod thus impacting trends and comparability  also same property noi includes a normalized management fee percentage in lieu of an administrative overhead allocation for comparative purposes  we eliminate depreciation and amortization expense which are property level expenses in computing same property noi as these are noncash expenses that are based on historical cost accounting assumptions and management believes these expenses do not offer the investor significant insight into the operations of the property this presentation allows management and investors to determine whether growth or declines in net operating income are a result of increases or decreases in property operations or the acquisition or disposition of additional properties while this
