questions   what is the difference between the oem version of backup now ez and the retail version of backup now ez the difference between the oem version of backup now ez and the retail version of backup ez is that with the oem version you can only backup to the toshiba external drive as in the retail version you can backup to any external drives cddvd or network hard drives i performed a complete system backup recently i noticed a message this morning that said that i had never backed up my registry how do i make sure my registry gets backed up that message is from a different application telling you it has not backed up your registry the complete system backup backs up everything on all the partitions on you first physical hard drive this includes your windows registry since applications do not know what other applications have done the program that is giving you that message is telling you that it also wants to backup your registry my destination drive is filling up very fast as the folder of the images and ‘my files’ generated from the backups are very large is there a way to identify and delete old backups if so can this be done automatically backup now ez runs an initial full backup for the baseline backup and then runs incremental backups because of this if you delete any backup files you need to delete them all when you do that the next time the backup runs it will create a new full baseline backup followed by more incremental backups if you have enough space you can rename the backup folder run the backup to create the new baseline backup and then delete the old renamed backup folder is it necessary to make a new bootable disc each time i run a complete system backup while the message to create a bootable disc appears at the end of every run of the complete system backup there is no difference in the discs created once you have made one you do not need to make another i have  hd in my computer c e f g h i how do i change the system drive in the backup program it is not getting my c drive but it is getting the h drive how can i change the drive what my system is in the complete system backup in backup now ez backs up the
