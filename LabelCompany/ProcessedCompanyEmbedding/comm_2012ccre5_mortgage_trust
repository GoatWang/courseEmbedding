policies and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor the company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the sec requirements to apply interpretation  for the vendor and related criterion with respect to the platform and the period the company provides the following assessment of compliance with respect to the applicable servicing criteria  the company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the applicable servicing criteria  the company has assessed compliance with the applicable servicing criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on interpretation  as described above in performing this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the securities and exchange commission in paragraph d of item  of regulation ab  based on such assessment the company has complied in all material respects with the applicable servicing criteria except as described in schedule a hereto  schedule b hereto includes managements discussion of the exceptions noted in schedule a including remediation efforts taken by the company as discussed in appendix b the company has amended its assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria dated february   to include certain previously omitted transactions in its platform kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period wells fargo bank national association by s brian bartlett brian bartlett title executive vice president dated december   page schedule a material instances of noncompliance by the company managements assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth by the securities and exchange commission in paragraph d of item  of regulation ab as of december   and for the period disclosed that material instances of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing criteria set forth in both of items dib and dii as follows  with respect to servicing criterion dib certain reports to investors did not provide information calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the transaction agreements  with respect to servicing criterion dii certain amounts due to investors were not allocated and remitted in accordance with timeframes distribution priority and other terms set forth in the transaction agreements schedule b managements discussion on material instances of noncompliance by the company disclosure during the period wells fargo identified payment errors as defined below and reporting errors as defined below on certain residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs transactions in the platform although no individually identified error in and of itself was found to be material to the platform when the errors were considered in the aggregate management determined that for platform purposes there were material instances of noncompliance with respect to both items dib and dii of regulation ab for purposes of this schedule b the term payment errors means the identified payment errors that occurred during the period and that when considered in the aggregate led to managements determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for the platform with respect to item dib of regulation ab for purposes of this schedule b the term reporting errors means the identified reporting errors that occurred during the period and that when considered in the aggregate led to managements determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for the platform with respect to item dii of regulation ab the identified payment errors and reporting errors on such rmbs transactions were attributable to certain failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and reporting that although adapted over time still insufficiently addressed the impact of the unprecedented levels of collateral degradation in rmbs transactions on the calculation of principal and interest payments and losses and associated investor reporting scope of the material instances of noncompliance the identified payment errors and reporting errors that led to managements determination that material instances of noncompliance with respect to the platform had occurred were limited to certain rmbs transactions in the platform there were no identified payment errors or reporting errors for nonrmbs transactions in the platform which contributed to managements determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the platform in some instances the identified payment errors which contributed to managements determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the platform were also considered material to the transactions on which they occurred none of the identified reporting errors which contributed to managements determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the platform were considered material for a particular transaction for all transactions in the platform including rmbs transactions with identified payment errors and reporting errors management delivered an item  certification to the extent it was required to do so pursuant to the requirements of the applicable transaction documents and regulation ab where there was an identified payment error that was considered material for an individual transaction the item  certification included a description of the nature and scope of such error remediation appropriate actions have been taken or are in the process of being taken to remediate the identified payment errors and reporting errors that led to managements determination that material instances of noncompliance with respect to the platform had occurred further adjustments have been or will be made to the waterfall calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures applied to the rmbs transactions in the platform to minimize the risk of future payment and reporting errors further disclosure earlier this year the staff of the securities exchange commission issued a comment letter to an issuer of certain residential mortgagebacked securities with questions regarding its  form k filings three of the questions posed on such comment letter pertained to wells fargos schedule b discussion of the material instances of noncompliance on its platform set forth above the comment letter questions and wells fargos response to such questions are set forth verbatim below beginning with the second succeeding paragraph the comment letter questions and wells fargo responses the statistics about identified payment errors and identified reporting errors as such terms are defined in the responses below set forth in wells fargos responses below were based on information known as of february   the date of the original  this section of schedule b was not in the original assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria dated february   page assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria as of the date of this amended assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria management is aware of an additional  identified payment errors and an additional  identified reporting errors the additional errors were found both on platform transactions that are denoted as omitted transactions on appendix a hereto and on nonomitted platform transactions the discussion in the below responses about the identified payment errors and identified reporting errors including statements about remediation is applicable to these additional identified payment errors and identified reporting errors comment letter questions and wells fargo responses  the report of wells fargo bank na wells fargo on its assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria states that certain failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and reporting that although adapted over time still insufficiently addressed the impact of the unprecedented levels of collateral degradation in rmbs transactions on the calculation of principal and interest payments and losses associated investor reporting your description is unclear with a view towards disclosure please explain  the specific failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and reporting  what you mean by unprecedented levels of collateral degradation and why that would have any effect on the calculation of the waterfall and  what you mean by adapted over time response for purposes of wells fargos response to questions   and  of the staffs comment letter reference is made to the following defined terms   assessment means with respect to its platform the assessment of compliance with applicable item d servicing criteria prepared by management of wells fargo relating to the  reporting period   attestation means the compliance attestation report of kpmg llp the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by wells fargo to issue such compliance attestation report in connection with the  assessment for the  reporting period   item  compliance reports means the  assessment and  attestation   reporting period means as of and for the year ending december    identified payment errors means with respect to the  reporting period the payment errors identified in the normal course of business and through specific procedures performed in connection with the preparation of the  item  compliance reports that led to the determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for wells fargos platform  identified reporting errors means with respect to the  reporting period the reporting errors identified in the normal course of business and through specific procedures performed in connection with the preparation of the  item  compliance reports that led to the determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for wells fargos platform  model means the model input the model program and the processes related to the model input and the model program that function together for the purpose of calculating payments in accordance with the requirements of relevant transaction documents  model errors refers to model input errors and model program errors  model input means data that is transmitted electronically or manually to a model such as data from a servicer data from financial services information providers cash adjustments such as reimbursable expenses and information from programs that perform interim calculations  model input errors means inaccurate or incomplete model input information inaccuracies in receiving or processing model input information or inaccuracies in manual nonautomated processing that lead to payment errors  this section of schedule b was not in the original assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria dated february   page  model program means model programming logic designed to calculate payments in accordance with transaction document requirements  model program errors means inaccurate or incomplete programming or logic in the model that does not produce calculations in accordance with the transaction documents and therefore causes payment errors andor reporting errors  platform means the trusteemaster servicersecurities administratorpaying agent platform designed by wells fargo that corresponds to the  assessment consisting of approximately  rmbs transactions in addition to other commercial mortgagebacked security and assetbacked security transactions  rmbs means residential mortgagebacked securities  wells fargo means the corporate trust services division of wells fargo bank na  the specific failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and reporting response wells fargo develops a unique model for each transaction in its platform on the whole there are millions of calculations performed by the models each payment period for the thousands of transactions in the platform wells fargos waterfall payment calculation and reporting functions can be categorized into three processes  model inputs  model programs and  transmission of each models output to the processes and systems that generate investor reports in the  reporting period there were  identified payment errors on rmbs transactions   of the  identified payment errors resulted from model input errors for example in certain transactions defaulted fixed rate loans became subject to unanticipated rate modifications when the loans were modified in accordance with industry loan modification initiatives because the transaction documents did not contemplate the rate modifications the model input process had to be manually adapted to incorporate the rate changes model input errors occurred when the manual adjustments were made   of the  identified payment errors resulted from model program errors for example in many rmbs transactions at the point credit support is depleted ie the principal balance of the subordinate bonds is reduced to zero payment allocations to the remaining senior bonds shift from a sequential payment priority to a pro rata payment priority in many cases the transaction documents require such shift to occur on and after the month in which credit support is depleted and in other transactions the shift occurs after the month in which credit support is depleted model program errors occurred when some model programs shifted payment allocations from sequential to pro rata in the wrong month inconsistent with the applicable transaction documents in addition with respect to transaction documents which direct the payment priority shift on and after credit support depletion model program errors occurred because proper effect was not given to the word on there is an order of operations in every waterfall that directs payments to bonds first and allocations of losses to bonds second because credit support depletion most often occurs from the allocation of losses to subordinate bonds this order of operation ie payments first losses second would have to be reversed to make a payment priority shift on the credit support depletion date model program errors occurred when the order of operations was not reversed in this manner  while there were also some identified payment errors on cmbs and abs transactions in the platform schedule b to the  assessment says the identified payment errors and reporting errors that led to managements determination that material instances of noncompliance with respect to the platform had occurred was limited to certain rmbs transactions in the platform there were no identified payment errors or reporting errors for nonrmbs transactions in the platform which contributed to managements determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the platform accordingly the statistics provided in this response relating to identified payment errors and identified reporting errors are limited to rmbs transactions in the platform  because it would be impractical to provide a detailed explanation of each of the  identified payment errors wells fargo has endeavored in its responses to questions   and  to provide meaningful examples of the identified payment errors and identified reporting errors the examples are illustrative but not representative of every individual error or error type page for the  reporting period there were  identified reporting errors on rmbs transactions   of the  identified reporting errors resulted from the  identified payment errors inaccurate payments led to inaccurate reporting   of the  identified reporting errors were unrelated to the identified payment errors   of the  identified reporting errors resulted from inaccurateincomplete bond reporting some examples of these  identified reporting errors include inaccurate reporting variables related to investor payments incorrect tranche balance reporting and incorrect trigger reporting   of the  identified reporting errors resulted from inaccurateincomplete mortgage loan reporting some examples of these  identified reporting errors include incorrect information on the collateral statement portion of the investor report inaccurate delinquency reporting and inaccurate loan level performance reporting  what you mean by unprecedented levels of collateral degradation and why that would have any effect on the calculation of the waterfall and response unprecedented levels of collateral degradation refers to the significant decrease in mortgage loan performance experienced by rmbs transactions generally over the past several years the significant decrease in loan performance is evidenced by the fact that over  percent of the rmbs transactions in wells fargos platform have reached credit support depletion this is a significant event because waterfall payment priorities for the senior bonds typically change at that point one reason why high levels of rmbs mortgage loan performance degradation affect waterfall calculations is because such degradation contributes to model input errors one example of such model input errors relates to the extensive level of mortgage loan delinquencies and the resulting extensive levels of servicer advancing high levels of advancing lead to both high advance recoveries by servicers in single distribution periods and increased servicer stop advance decisions these phenomena require manual processing which can result in model input errors the high level of rmbs mortgage loan performance degradation has also contributed to model program errors the extensive collateral losses in rmbs transactions have triggered waterfall scenarios that were considered unlikely to occur at the inception of the transactions if they were considered at all and were not as clearly detailed as other provisions in the transaction agreements that direct waterfall calculations and distributions at model creation those waterfall scenarios were not forecasted to reach the levels of underperformance that rmbs mortgage loans have experienced because of such lack of forecasting and the absence of benchmark data for such scenarios from the underwriterssponsors of the transactions or other sources wells fargo was unable to test and validate such waterfall scenarios as a result model program errors occurred  what you mean by adapted over time response adapted over time refers to the fact that model programs and model inputs and the processes related to model programs and model inputs are over the life of a transaction constantly being adjusted in an effort to ensure accurate payments continual adjustments are required because the transactions and securities to which the models relate are very complex and the technology and processes related to model programs and model inputs are equally complex the level of adjustment needed for model programs model inputs and related processes increased as mortgage loan performance degradation increased  we note reference to payment errors and reporting errors with a view towards disclosure please explain whether these are the same type of payment errors and reporting errors that were described in wells fargos assessment of compliance for  that you further described in a response to us on december   in that response letter wells fargo confirmed the correction and resolution of modeling errors and that indicated that adjustments to payments were made in  if these are not the same type of errors as those that occurred in  please state so in either case with a view towards disclosure please explain  see footnote   a stop advance decision is made by a servicer when with respect to any advance made in the past or any proposed future advance it determines that such advances will not be recoverable from collections on the loan or from liquidation proceeds  there were principally two types of benchmark data used decrement tables and underwritersponsor cash flow projections the decrement tables in offering documents generally only projected out at pricing speeds with zero loss assumptions reconciling models with those decrement tables based on those assumptions would not have exposed the stresses on the model programs resulting from the significant mortgage loan performance degradation in recent years in addition cash flow projections received from the underwriterssponsors at the time of deal issuance were projected at minimal losses which were not severe enough to expose the stresses on the model programs resulting from the significant collateral degradation in recent years page general response the identified payment errors and the identified reporting errors were generally similar in type to the payment and reporting errors that led to the determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for the  assessment of compliance however the transactions on which the errors occurred and the exact circumstances and details giving rise to the identified payment errors and identified reporting errors in  were different than  the correction of the  identified payment errors and reporting errors was specific to the models for the affected transactions and such corrections do not preclude the possibility that a similar type of error would occur on a different transaction with a different model in  examples of model program errors that occurred similarly in both years involve i postcredit support depletion loss allocation methodology and payment priority rules eg pro rata versus sequential and ii the calculation of groupdirected cash flows interest calculation elements rate accrual day logic etc and precredit support depletion loss allocation examples of model input errors that occurred similarly in both years involve i improper coding of cash adjustments and using incorrect prior month data ii loan modification inputs related to capitalization of delinquent amounts and the recovery of advances related thereto and modified interest rates in certain transaction structures and iii cash adjustments related to servicer advance reimbursements that caused errors in certain calculations eg the net weighted average coupon rate calculations comparing the identified reporting errors to the identified reporting errors in  a substantial number in each year were caused by the payment errors ie reporting an incorrect payment there were other reporting errors in both years that related to missing and incorrect bond information and missing and incorrect mortgage loan information  whether the payment errors resulted in overpayments or underpayments to investors response in most cases the identified payment errors were a combination of overpayments to one or more classes of investors or transaction parties and corresponding underpayments to one or more other classes of investors or other transaction parties therefore most of the identified payment errors consisted of overpayments and underpayments that netted to zero because all the cash that was received from a transaction party in a payment cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction parties on the related payment date   the types of reporting errors that occurred and how they related to the payment errors response  of the  identified reporting errors were caused by the identified payment errors in that the incorrect payment led to incorrect reporting since the identified payment errors were calculated incorrectly the payments were reported incorrectly the remaining  of the  identified reporting errors were not caused by the identified payment errors those  identified reporting errors consisted of missing or inaccurate information related to various bond reporting and mortgage loan reporting elements  whether investors whose payments were impacted were notified of the errors and if so how they were notified response investors received notice of the identified payment errors by means of the posting to wells fargos website of corrected payment date statements investors received notice of investor reporting errors by either a revised statement in connection with a restatement of the affected distributions or by correcting the reporting error on the next payment date statement  whether any underpayments were paid or will be paid to investors and if so when the payments were made or will be made and  while most identified payment errors netted to zero a small number of the identified payment errors did not net to zero identified payment errors that did not net to zero occurred when inadvertently either i less than  percent the cash that was received from a transaction party such as a servicer in a payment cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction parties on the related payment date leaving cash in the transactions distribution account or ii an amount greater than  percent of the cash that was received from a transaction party such as a servicer in a payment cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction parties on the related payment date causing an overdraft of the transactions distribution account the scenario described in clause i explains the majority of circumstances where overpayments and underpayments did not net to zero  as used in this response the term restatement and the phrase restating affected distribution periods means the correction of an overpayment or underpayment experienced by a class of bookentry securities by i submitting a revised payment date statement for each affected distribution period to the depository trust company dtc by which the dtc adjusts the accounts of the overpaid and underpaid classes and ii the posting of such revised payment date statement to wells fargos website in accordance with its current policy the dtc revises up to twelve months of affected distributions on a limited number of occasions when the affected distribution periods extended beyond such twelve month time frame wells fargo included adjustments for the additional distribution periods in the restatement of the twelve distribution periods and notified investors of this fact on the revised payment date statements the process is similar for physical securities except that wells fargo interacts directly with affected holders as opposed to interacting with the dtc page response with one exception  identified payment errors that resulted in underpayments to investors were rectified by means of restating affected distribution periods the restatements occurred between february   and march    whether any future payments were adjusted to account for overpayments response with one exception described in footnote  identified payment errors that resulted in overpayments to investors were rectified by restating the affected distribution periods except with respect to one identified payment error on one transaction unrelated to the transactions to which the comment letter relates no future payments were adjusted in connection with overpayment errors in that one case distributions to one class of certificates were adjusted over three distribution dates and such adjustment was disclosed on the respective distribution date statements  while we note that wells fargo further states that appropriate actions have been taken or are in the process of being taken to remediate the identified errors and adjustments have been or will be made to the waterfall calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures applied to the rmbs transactions in the platform to minimize the risk of future payment and reporting errors this disclosure however does not provide any indication as to the nature and scope of the failures or the impact of the identified material instances of noncompliance we believe a more granular discussion is necessary to understand how these steps have addressed the identified material instances of noncompliance with a view towards disclosure please explain  the specific actions that have been taken or are in the process of being taken to remediate the identified payment errors and reporting errors response except as discussed in footnote  wells fargo has remediated all of the  identified payment errors through restatements of the affected distribution periods the restatements occurred between february   and march   wells fargo has remediated all  identified reporting errors by either issuing a revised statement in connection with a restatement of the affected payments or by ensuring that the reporting element in question was correctly reported on the next payment date statement  the specific adjustments that have been or will be made to the waterfall calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures applied to the rmbs transactions in the platform and response wells fargo has determined to address not only the specific errors that led to the determination of material instances of noncompliance on the rmbs component of its platform but also to take proactive measures to identify other problems with its models that could cause payment or reporting errors accordingly wells fargo has undertaken an expansive project to identify rectify and prevent problems with its models and the individual transactions that exhibited these problems wells fargo is in the early stages of this project due to the size of the rmbs component of its platform this is a long term intensive project involving significant internal and external resources in conjunction with other steps taken wells fargo believes that this initiative will result in ongoing improvements to its payment and reporting processes  any other steps that wells fargo has undertaken or will undertake to ensure that similar errors do not occur in the future response throughout  and  wells fargo has adopted numerous other initiatives in an effort to add rigor to its operational processes and quality control measures the initiatives relate to both preventing model errors and identifying and correcting model errors examples of measures to prevent model errors include among other things enhancements to its i new model creation procedures ii procedures for preclosing review of waterfall language in transaction documents and iii procedures for prepayment date testing of transaction level payment calculations and reporting elements examples of measures to identify and correct model errors include among other things a enhanced procedures relating to model revisions b the creation of a team charged with conducting a careful analysis of every model error to determine if any additional controls are necessary to prevent the errors from reoccurring and c the creation of a team to proactively perform model program corrections to prevent future model errors wells fargo has hired over two dozen additional staff and reorganized various teams to more effectively manage the abovementioned operational processes and quality control measures material instance of noncompliance by any vendor none material deficiencies in companys policies and procedures to monitor vendors compliance none  there is one underpayment of  and a corresponding overpayment of the same amount from march  which has not been remedied the underpayment did not occur on any transaction to which the commissions comment letter directly relates wells fargo is in the process of determining an appropriate course of action with regard to this underpayment page appendix a to the companys assessment of compliance with the
