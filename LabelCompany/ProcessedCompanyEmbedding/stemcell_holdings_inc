medical technology holdings demonstrates amniostem derived exosomes inhibit glioma growth companys unique stem cell nanotechnology approach appears to stimulate regeneration of healthy brain cells while selectively inhibiting glioma brain cancer news provided by creative medical technology holdings inc jul    et share this article san diego and phoenix july   prnewswire  creative medical technology holdings inc otcqbcelz a clinical stage stem cell company announced preclinical data showing exosomes harvested from its patented amniostem amniotic fluid stem cell selectively inhibit growth of glioma brain cancer cells  exosomes are nanoparticles generated by a variety of cells that are critically involved in intercellular communication  the company previously filed patents on the use of amniostem derived exosomes for treatment of stroke  the amniostem technology was originally licensed from the university of california san diego ucsd under an exclusive agreement covering issued us patent  having seen firsthand the devastation and lack of treatment options in glioma patients i am excited about the prospect of developing a nontoxic biological approach that eventually may provide benefit to this group of patients said santosh kesari md phd fana faan chair and professor department of translational neurosciences and neurotherapeutics john wayne cancer institute as well as director of neurooncology providence saint johns health center and leads the pacific neuroscience research center at pacific neuroscience institute the filed patent application contains data showing that while amniostem derived exosomes inhibited proliferation of glioma cells other stem cell types actually increased proliferation of glioma said thomas ichim phd chief scientific officer of creative medical technology holdings  we are currently working under the possibility that amniostem stem cells may possess unique biological properties that are different from other types of stem cells from a commercialization perspective exosomes are simpler to manufacture store and deliver as compared to living cells  additionally since exosomes are not replicating cells we anticipate a less complicated fda regulatory pathway as compared to cellular based products said timothy warbington president and ceo of creative medical technology holdings about creative medical technology holdings

isolation systems and accessory products for life science research driven by science and a passion for quality stemcell supports the advancement of scientific research around the world with our catalogue of more than  cell biology research tools stemcell technologies was launched in  when founder and ceo allen eaves needed a way to meet the increasing demands for his standardized costeffective cell culture media for growing bloodforming stem cells at the time eaves was a hematologist and cancer researcher heading the terry fox laboratories tfl and head of clinical hematology at the university of british columbia in vancouver canada unsatisfied with commercially available cell culture reagents eaves’ research group at the tfl began making their own hematopoietic stem cell culture media using the highest quality materials they could find colleagues also wanted to use this media and eaves was able to supplement his research funds by selling culture media to other lab groups eventually the demand for the media from researchers around the world warranted building a designated clean room for production the tfl did not have the funding and instead eaves was encouraged to purchase the business and create an independent company mortgaging his house and receiving a loan from western economic diversification eaves was able to build a clean room and stemcell technologies inc was born on july   stemcell has become the largest biotech company in canada and continues to reinvest all profits back into developing products to better support the international
