with the continental broken out as a separate make at the top of fords product line and to add a premiumintermediate vehicle to the intermediate slot vacated by lincolncitation neededoriginal research marketing research and development for the new intermediate line had begun in  under the code name e car which stood for experimental car ford motor company eventually decided on the name edsel in honor of edsel b ford son of the companys founder henry ford despite objections from henry ford ii the proposed vehicle marque would represent the startup of a new division of the firm alongside that of ford itself and the lincolnmercury division whose cars at the time shared the same bodies ford later claimed to have performed more than adequate if not superior product development and market research work in the planning and design of the new vehicle particularly ford assured its investors and the detroit automotive press that the edsel was not only a superior product as compared to its oldsmobilebuickdesoto competition but the details of its styling and specifications were the result of a sophisticated market analysis and research and development effort that would essentially guarantee its broad acceptance by the buying public when the car was introduced its elegance its engines its exciting new features make other cars seem ordinary edsel advertisement  the edsel was introduced amid considerable publicity on e day—september   it was also promoted by a toprated television special the edsel show on october  but the promotional effort was not enough to counter the adverse initial public reaction to the cars styling and conventional build the day after its launch the edsel was described as a reborn lasalle a brand that had disappeared in  for months ford had been telling the industry press that it knew through its market research that there would be great demand for the vehicle ford also insisted that in the edsel it had built exactly the entirely new kind of car that ford had been leading the buying public to expect through its preintroduction publicity campaign for the car in reality however the edsel shared its engineering and bodywork with other ford models and the similarities were apparent once the vehicle was viewed firsthand the edsel was to be sold through a newly formed division of the ford motor company as a companion to the ford division mercury division lincoln division and newly formed but also shortlived continental division each division had its own retail organization and dealer network the freestanding edsel division existed from november  until january  after which edsel sales and marketing operations were integrated into the mercuryedsellincoln division referred to as mel initially edsel was sold through a new network of approximately  dealers this briefly brought the total number of dealers of all ford products to  ford saw this as a way to come closer to parity with chrysler which had  dealers and general motors which had  as soon as it became apparent that the edsels were not selling many of these dealers added lincolnmercury ford of britain or ford of germany franchises to their dealerships with the encouragement of ford motor company some dealers however closed a  edsel pacer door hardtop for the  model year ford produced four submodels of edsel the larger mercurybased citation and corsair and the smaller fordbased pacer and ranger the citation was offered in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop and twodoor convertible versions the corsair was available in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop versions the pacer was available as a twodoor or fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan or twodoor convertible the ranger was sold in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop or sedan versions the fourdoor bermuda and villager wagons and the twodoor roundup wagon were based on the inch wheelbase ford station wagon platform and shared the trim and features of the ranger and pacer models the edsel offered several features that were considered innovative for the time including its rollingdome speedometer warning lights for such conditions as low oil level parking brake engaged and engine overheating and its pushbutton teletouch transmission shifting system in the center of the steering wheel a conventional columnshift automatic was also available at a reduced price other edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and selfadjusting brakes which ford claimed for the edsel as a first for the industry even though studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade the edsel also offered such advanced features for the time as seat belts which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes and childproof rear door locks that could only be opened with the key edsel ranger interior showing the teletouch system and rolling dome speedometer unlike ford and mercury the edsel division never had any dedicated manufacturing plants all edsels were built in ford or mercury plants on a contract basis in the first year  edsels were sold in the united states and  were sold in canada though below expectations this nevertheless represented the secondlargest launch for any new car brand to date exceeded only by the desoto introduction in  for the  model year the edsel brand fielded only two series the fordbased ranger and corsair the larger mercurybased edsels were discontinued replacing the pacer as the topline fordbased edsel the new corsair was offered as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan and twodoor convertible the ranger was sold as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop twodoor and fourdoor sedan and the villager station wagon in the  model year  edsels were sold in the us and  were sold in canada for the  model year edsels last only  vehicles were produced all but the pilot cars were assembled at the louisville kentucky assembly plant the marque was reduced to the ranger series of sedans hardtops convertibles and the villager station wagons the edsel shared its basic chassis glass and major sheet metal with the  ford galaxie and fairlane models that were built on the louisville assembly line with it but the edsel had its own unique grille hood and four upright oblong taillights along with its sidesweep spears the edsels front and rear bumpers were also unique the  edsel rode on a inch wheelbase compared to the concurrent fords inch span and it also used a different rear suspension the cars did however share engines and transmissions the  edsel ranger fourdoor hardtop model used the thinpillar ford fairlane fourdoor sedan roofline as opposed to the square roofline used on the corresponding ford fourdoor hardtop which was exclusive to the galaxie line the galaxie fourdoor hardtops rear door trim panel however was fitted to the ranger this gave the edsel fourdoor hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any  ford end of the edseledit  edsel ranger sedan ford announced the end of the edsel program on november   however production continued until late in november with the final tally of  model year  cars total edsel sales were approximately  less than half the companys projected breakeven point the company lost  million or the equivalent of  in  dollars on the venture only  edsels were built including  produced in ontario canada by us auto industry standards these production figures were dismal particularly when spread across a run of three model years on friday november  united press internationals upi wire service reported that book values for used edsels had declined by as much as  based on condition and age immediately following the ford press release in some newspaper markets dealers scrambled to renegotiate newspaper advertising contracts involving the  edsel models while others dropped the name from their dealerships advertising entirely ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased  models and carryover  models prior to the announcement valued at  to  toward the purchase of new ford products to offset the decreased values the company also issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received following the announcement edsel and its failuresedit historians have advanced several theories in an effort to explain the edsels failure popular culture often faults the car’s styling consumer reports has alleged that poor workmanship was the edsels chief problem marketing experts hold the edsel up as a supreme example of the corporate culture’s failure to understand american consumers business analysts cite the weak internal support for the product inside ford’s executive offices according to author and edsel scholar jan deutsch the edsel was the wrong car at the wrong time the aim was right but the target movededit the edsel is most notorious for being a marketing disaster indeed the name edsel became synonymous with the reallife commercial failure of the predicted perfect product or product idea similar illfated products have often been colloquially referred to as edsels fords own sierra model which launched almost  years later is often compared to the edsel owing to initial buyer antipathy to its perceived radical styling even though unlike the edsel it ultimately became a sales success since the edsel program was such a debacle it gave marketers a vivid illustration of how not to market a product the principal reason the edsels failure is so infamous is that ford had absolutely no idea that the failure was going to happen until after the vehicles had been designed and built the dealerships established and  million invested in the products development and launch incredibly ford had presumed to invest  million well over  billion in the st century in developing a new product line without attempting to determine whether such an investment would be wise or prudent the prerelease advertising campaign promoted the car as having more you ideas and the teaser advertisements in magazines only revealed glimpses of the car through a highly blurred lens or wrapped in paper or under tarps in fact ford had never “test marketed” the vehicle or its unique styling concepts with potential “real” buyers prior to either the vehicle’s initial development decision or the vehicle’s shipments to its new dealerships edsels were shipped to the dealerships undercover and remained wrapped on the dealer lots the public also had difficulty understanding what the edsel was primarily because ford made the mistake of pricing the edsel within mercury’s market price segment theoretically the edsel was conceived to fit into ford’s marketing structure as the brand slotted in between ford and mercury however when the car debuted in  its least expensive model—the ranger—was priced within  of the most expensive and besttrimmed ford sedan and  less than mercury’s base medalist model in its midrange pricing edsels pacer and corsair models were more expensive than their mercury counterparts edsels topoftheline citation fourdoor hardtop model was the only model priced to correctly compete with mercury’s midrange montclair turnpike cruiser model as illustrated in the chart below  ford motor company pricing fob structure ford edsel mercury lincoln continental – capri – premiere – park lane – citation – montclair – corsair – pacer – monterey – fairlane  – ranger – medalist – galaxie  – custom  – not only was the edsel competing against its own sister divisions but model for model buyers did not understand what the car was supposed to be—a step above the mercury or a step below it after its introduction to the public the edsel did not live up to its preproduction publicity even though it did offer many new features such as selfadjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication while fords market research had indicated that these and other features would make the e car attractive to them as car buyers the edsels selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay upon seeing the price for a base model many potential buyers simply left the dealerships other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped topoftheline model the wrong car at the wrong timeedit one of the external forces working against the edsel was the onset of an economic recession in late  compounding edsels problems was the fact that the car had to compete with wellestablished nameplates from the big three such as pontiac oldsmobile buick dodge and desoto as well as with its own internal sister division mercury which itself had never been a stellar sales success to make matters still worse as a new make edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers as its competing makes had even if the – recession had not occurred the edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace in the early s when the e car was in its earliest stages of development ford executive vice president ernest r breech had convinced ford management that the mediumpriced market segment offered great untapped opportunity at the time breechs assessment was basically correct in  pontiac buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units but by the fall of  when the edsel was introduced the market had changed drastically independent manufacturers in the mediumpriced field were drifting toward insolvency hoping to reverse its losses packard acquired studebaker which was also in financial difficulty the board decided to stop production under the venerable packard badge after  the – packards were little more than studebakers badged as packards attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its premerger brands nash and hudson after the  model year sales of chryslers desoto marque dropped dramatically from its  high by over  in  when desoto sales failed to rebound during the  model year plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by  indeed sales for most car manufacturers even those not introducing new models were down among domestic makes only rambler and lincoln produced more cars in  than in  customers started buying more fuelefficient automobiles particularly volkswagen beetles which were selling at rates exceeding  a year in the us from  onward edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration but they also required premium fuel and their fuel economy especially in city driving was poor even by lates standards ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury by  buyers had become fascinated with economy cars and a large car like the edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own when ford introduced the falcon in  it sold over  units in its first year fords investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the edsel helped make the companys subsequent success with the falcon possible by  the market for mediumpriced cars had recovered and this time ford had the right car the galaxie  ltd the ltds success led chevrolet to introduce the caprice as a mid upscale trim option on its topoftheline impala fourdoor hardtop edsel a difficult name to placeedit the name of the car edsel is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity naming the vehicle after edsel ford was proposed early in its development however the ford family strongly opposed its use henry ford ii declared that he did not want his fathers good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps ford also ran internal studies to decide on a name and even dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas they reached no conclusions ford retained the advertising firm foote cone  belding to come up with a name when the agency issued its report citing over  possibilities fords ernest breech commented that they had been hired to develop one name not  early favorites for the name brand included citation corsair pacer and ranger which were ultimately chosen for the vehicles series names david wallace manager of marketing research and coworker bob young unofficially invited freethinker poet marianne moore for input and suggestions moores unorthodox contributions among them utopian turtletop pastelogram turcotinga resilient bullet andante con moto and mongoose civique were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature by the instruction of ernest breech who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of henry ford ii the car was finally called edsel in honor of edsel ford former company president and son of henry ford reliabilityedit even though the edsel shared its basic technology with other ford products a number of issues caused reliability problems mostly with the  models reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other ford models ford never dedicated a standalone factory solely to edsel model production the firstyear  edsels were assembled in both mercury and ford factories the longerwheelbase models citation and corsair were produced alongside the mercury products while the shorterwheelbase models pacer and ranger were produced alongside the ford products workers assembling fords and mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional edsel that moved down the line burdensome because it required them to change tools and parts bins then switch back to resume assembling fords or mercurys after completing assembly on the edsel the workers were also expected to accommodate edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of ford and mercury production consequently the desired quality control of the different edsel models proved difficult to achieve even when the fords and mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines many edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics some of whom never installed the additional parts at all some dealers did not even receive all the parts in the march  issue of popular mechanics  of edsel owners reported poor workmanship with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure in its test car popular mechanics tested for these problems and noted others such as the trunk leaking badly in a storm and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled design controversiesedit the distinctive center grille of the  edsel the edsels most memorable design feature was its trademark horsecollar or toilet seat grille which was quite distinct from other cars of the period according to a popular joke at the time the edsel resembled an oldsmobile sucking a lemon while automotive critic neil dan cites the grilles vaginal appearance the edsels frontend ensemble as it eventually appeared bore little resemblance if any to the original concept roy brown the original chief designer on the edsel project had envisioned a slender almost delicate opening in the center engineers fearing engine cooling problems vetoed the intended design which led to the nowinfamous horsecollar the vertical grille theme while improved for the  models was discontinued for the  models which were similar to ford models of the same year although coincidentally the new frontend design was very similar to that of the  pontiac the teletouch pushbutton automatic transmission selector was an extremely complex feature it proved problematic in part because the steering wheel hub where the pushbuttons were located was the traditional location of the horn button some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn while the edsel was fast the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing there were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons d for drag l for leap and r for race instead of drive low and reverse the control wires for teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and in some cases complete failure the electrical design required drivers to shift from park to reverse to neutral to drive in that order to avoid overloading the teletouch motor the motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of park while on a hill so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the park button complaints also surfaced about the taillights on model edsel station wagons the lenses were boomerangshaped and placed in a reverse fashion at a distance they appeared as arrows pointed in the opposite direction of the turn being made when the left turn signal flashed its arrow shape pointed right and vice versa however there was little that could be done to give the fordbased station wagons a unique appearance from the rear because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed only the taillights and trim could be touched there was room for separate turn signals in addition to the boomerangs but the us industry had never supplied them up to that point and they were probably never seriously considered mechanics of the time were wary of the cubicinch edsel e engine because its perfectly flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers the heads were set at an angle with roof pistons forming both a squish zone on one side and a combustion chamber on the other combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore this design was similar to chevrolets cubicinch w engine which was also introduced in  while the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics company politics and the role of robert mcnamaraedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september  learn how and when to remove this template message an intriguing aspect of the edsel story is that it provides a case study in how company politics can kill an idea while the car and ford’s planning of the car are the most often cited reasons for its failure internal ford motor company memoranda indicate that the edsel may actually have been a victim of dissension within fords management ranks following world war ii henry ford ii retained robert mcnamara as one of the whiz kids to help turn ford around mcnamara’s costcutting and costcontainment skills helped ford emerge from its nearcollapse after the war as a result mcnamara eventually amassed a considerable amount of power at ford mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that like the elder ford mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the companys other products thus mcnamara had little use for the continental lincoln mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company mcnamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for continental lincoln mercury and edsel cars and moved to consolidate lincoln mercury and edsel into the mel division mcnamara saw to it that the continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the lincoln range for  he next set his sights on edsel by maneuvering for elimination of the dual wheelbases and separate bodies used in  instead the edsel would share the ford platform and use ford’s inner body structure for  in  the edsel emerged as little more than a ford with different trim mcnamara also moved to reduce edsel’s advertising budget for  and for  he virtually eliminated it the final blow came in the fall of  when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of fords management that the edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before the edsel bled the company dry mcnamara also attempted to discontinue the lincoln nameplate but that effort ended with elwood engels now classic redesign of  mcnamara left ford when he was named secretary of defense by president john f kennedy during the  presidential election republican nominee barry goldwater blamed mcnamara then secretary of defense for the edsels failure eventually fords former executive vice president ernest r breech who was a financial contributor to goldwater wrote to the senators campaign explaining that mr mcnamara… had nothing to do with the plans for the edsel car or any part of the program however the charge continued to be leveled against mcnamara for years during his time as head of the world bank mcnamara instructed his public affairs officer to distribute copies of breechs letter to the press whenever the accusation was made the edsel cometedit the scheduled  edsel comet compact car was hastily rebranded as the comet and assigned to lincolnmercury dealerships as a standalone product based on the

sold to the public that allude to being part of the edsel family of models included the instrument cluster rear tailfins though canted diagonally and the taillight shape the lens is visually similar

teaser campaign leading consumers to believe that the edsel was the car of the future – an expectation it failed to meet after it was unveiled to the public it was considered to be unattractive

marketing research and development for the new intermediate line had begun in  under the code name e car which stood for experimental car ford motor company eventually decided on the name edsel in honor of edsel b ford son of the companys founder henry ford despite objections from henry ford ii the proposed vehicle marque would represent the startup of a new division of the firm alongside that of ford itself and the lincolnmercury division whose cars at the time shared the same bodies ford later claimed to have performed more than adequate if not superior product development and market research work in the planning and design of the new vehicle particularly ford assured its investors and the detroit automotive press that the edsel was not only a superior product as compared to its oldsmobilebuickdesoto competition but the details of its styling and specifications were the result of a sophisticated market analysis and research and development effort that would essentially guarantee its broad acceptance by the buying public when the car was introduced its elegance its engines its exciting new features make other cars seem ordinary edsel advertisement  the edsel was introduced amid considerable publicity on e day—september   it was also promoted by a toprated television special the edsel show on october  but the promotional effort was not enough to counter the adverse initial public reaction to the cars styling and conventional build the day after its launch the edsel was described as a reborn lasalle a brand that had disappeared in  for months ford had been telling the industry press that it knew through its market research that there would be great demand for the vehicle ford also insisted that in the edsel it had built exactly the entirely new kind of car that ford had been leading the buying public to expect through its preintroduction publicity campaign for the car in reality however the edsel shared its engineering and bodywork with other ford models and the similarities were apparent once the vehicle was viewed firsthand the edsel was to be sold through a newly formed division of the ford motor company as a companion to the ford division mercury division lincoln division and newly formed but also shortlived continental division each division had its own retail organization and dealer network the freestanding edsel division existed from november  until january  after which edsel sales and marketing operations were integrated into the mercuryedsellincoln division referred to as mel initially edsel was sold through a new network of approximately  dealers this briefly brought the total number of dealers of all ford products to  ford saw this as a way to come closer to parity with chrysler which had  dealers and general motors which had  as soon as it became apparent that the edsels were not selling many of these dealers added lincolnmercury ford of britain or ford of germany franchises to their dealerships with the encouragement of ford motor company some dealers however closed a  edsel pacer door hardtop for the  model year ford produced four submodels of edsel the larger mercurybased citation and corsair and the smaller fordbased pacer and ranger the citation was offered in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop and twodoor convertible versions the corsair was available in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop versions the pacer was available as a twodoor or fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan or twodoor convertible the ranger was sold in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop or sedan versions the fourdoor bermuda and villager wagons and the twodoor roundup wagon were based on the inch wheelbase ford station wagon platform and shared the trim and features of the ranger and pacer models the edsel offered several features that were considered innovative for the time including its rollingdome speedometer warning lights for such conditions as low oil level parking brake engaged and engine overheating and its pushbutton teletouch transmission shifting system in the center of the steering wheel a conventional columnshift automatic was also available at a reduced price other edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and selfadjusting brakes which ford claimed for the edsel as a first for the industry even though studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade the edsel also offered such advanced features for the time as seat belts which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes and childproof rear door locks that could only be opened with the key edsel ranger interior showing the teletouch system and rolling dome speedometer unlike ford and mercury the edsel division never had any dedicated manufacturing plants all edsels were built in ford or mercury plants on a contract basis in the first year  edsels were sold in the united states and  were sold in canada though below expectations this nevertheless represented the secondlargest launch for any new car brand to date exceeded only by the desoto introduction in  for the  model year the edsel brand fielded only two series the fordbased ranger and corsair the larger mercurybased edsels were discontinued replacing the pacer as the topline fordbased edsel the new corsair was offered as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan and twodoor convertible the ranger was sold as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop twodoor and fourdoor sedan and the villager station wagon in the  model year  edsels were sold in the us and  were sold in canada for the  model year edsels last only  vehicles were produced all but the pilot cars were assembled at the louisville kentucky assembly plant the marque was reduced to the ranger series of sedans hardtops convertibles and the villager station wagons the edsel shared its basic chassis glass and major sheet metal with the  ford galaxie and fairlane models that were built on the louisville assembly line with it but the edsel had its own unique grille hood and four upright oblong taillights along with its sidesweep spears the edsels front and rear bumpers were also unique the  edsel rode on a inch wheelbase compared to the concurrent fords inch span and it also used a different rear suspension the cars did however share engines and transmissions the  edsel ranger fourdoor hardtop model used the thinpillar ford fairlane fourdoor sedan roofline as opposed to the square roofline used on the corresponding ford fourdoor hardtop which was exclusive to the galaxie line the galaxie fourdoor hardtops rear door trim panel however was fitted to the ranger this gave the edsel fourdoor hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any  ford end of the edseledit  edsel ranger sedan ford announced the end of the edsel program on november   however production continued until late in november with the final tally of  model year  cars total edsel sales were approximately  less than half the companys projected breakeven point the company lost  million or the equivalent of  in  dollars on the venture only  edsels were built including  produced in ontario canada by us auto industry standards these production figures were dismal particularly when spread across a run of three model years on friday november  united press internationals upi wire service reported that book values for used edsels had declined by as much as  based on condition and age immediately following the ford press release in some newspaper markets dealers scrambled to renegotiate newspaper advertising contracts involving the  edsel models while others dropped the name from their dealerships advertising entirely ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased  models and carryover  models prior to the announcement valued at  to  toward the purchase of new ford products to offset the decreased values the company also issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received following the announcement edsel and its failuresedit historians have advanced several theories in an effort to explain the edsels failure popular culture often faults the car’s styling consumer reports has alleged that poor workmanship was the edsels chief problem marketing experts hold the edsel up as a supreme example of the corporate culture’s failure to understand american consumers business analysts cite the weak internal support for the product inside ford’s executive offices according to author and edsel scholar jan deutsch the edsel was the wrong car at the wrong time the aim was right but the target movededit the edsel is most notorious for being a marketing disaster indeed the name edsel became synonymous with the reallife commercial failure of the predicted perfect product or product idea similar illfated products have often been colloquially referred to as edsels fords own sierra model which launched almost  years later is often compared to the edsel owing to initial buyer antipathy to its perceived radical styling even though unlike the edsel it ultimately became a sales success since the edsel program was such a debacle it gave marketers a vivid illustration of how not to market a product the principal reason the edsels failure is so infamous is that ford had absolutely no idea that the failure was going to happen until after the vehicles had been designed and built the dealerships established and  million invested in the products development and launch incredibly ford had presumed to invest  million well over  billion in the st century in developing a new product line without attempting to determine whether such an investment would be wise or prudent the prerelease advertising campaign promoted the car as having more you ideas and the teaser advertisements in magazines only revealed glimpses of the car through a highly blurred lens or wrapped in paper or under tarps in fact ford had never “test marketed” the vehicle or its unique styling concepts with potential “real” buyers prior to either the vehicle’s initial development decision or the vehicle’s shipments to its new dealerships edsels were shipped to the dealerships undercover and remained wrapped on the dealer lots the public also had difficulty understanding what the edsel was primarily because ford made the mistake of pricing the edsel within mercury’s market price segment theoretically the edsel was conceived to fit into ford’s marketing structure as the brand slotted in between ford and mercury however when the car debuted in  its least expensive model—the ranger—was priced within  of the most expensive and besttrimmed ford sedan and  less than mercury’s base medalist model in its midrange pricing edsels pacer and corsair models were more expensive than their mercury counterparts edsels topoftheline citation fourdoor hardtop model was the only model priced to correctly compete with mercury’s midrange montclair turnpike cruiser model as illustrated in the chart below  ford motor company pricing fob structure ford edsel mercury lincoln continental – capri – premiere – park lane – citation – montclair – corsair – pacer – monterey – fairlane  – ranger – medalist – galaxie  – custom  – not only was the edsel competing against its own sister divisions but model for model buyers did not understand what the car was supposed to be—a step above the mercury or a step below it after its introduction to the public the edsel did not live up to its preproduction publicity even though it did offer many new features such as selfadjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication while fords market research had indicated that these and other features would make the e car attractive to them as car buyers the edsels selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay upon seeing the price for a base model many potential buyers simply left the dealerships other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped topoftheline model the wrong car at the wrong timeedit one of the external forces working against the edsel was the onset of an economic recession in late  compounding edsels problems was the fact that the car had to compete with wellestablished nameplates from the big three such as pontiac oldsmobile buick dodge and desoto as well as with its own internal sister division mercury which itself had never been a stellar sales success to make matters still worse as a new make edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers as its competing makes had even if the – recession had not occurred the edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace in the early s when the e car was in its earliest stages of development ford executive vice president ernest r breech had convinced ford management that the mediumpriced market segment offered great untapped opportunity at the time breechs assessment was basically correct in  pontiac buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units but by the fall of  when the edsel was introduced the market had changed drastically independent manufacturers in the mediumpriced field were drifting toward insolvency hoping to reverse its losses packard acquired studebaker which was also in financial difficulty the board decided to stop production under the venerable packard badge after  the – packards were little more than studebakers badged as packards attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its premerger brands nash and hudson after the  model year sales of chryslers desoto marque dropped dramatically from its  high by over  in  when desoto sales failed to rebound during the  model year plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by  indeed sales for most car manufacturers even those not introducing new models were down among domestic makes only rambler and lincoln produced more cars in  than in  customers started buying more fuelefficient automobiles particularly volkswagen beetles which were selling at rates exceeding  a year in the us from  onward edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration but they also required premium fuel and their fuel economy especially in city driving was poor even by lates standards ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury by  buyers had become fascinated with economy cars and a large car like the edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own when ford introduced the falcon in  it sold over  units in its first year fords investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the edsel helped make the companys subsequent success with the falcon possible by  the market for mediumpriced cars had recovered and this time ford had the right car the galaxie  ltd the ltds success led chevrolet to introduce the caprice as a mid upscale trim option on its topoftheline impala fourdoor hardtop edsel a difficult name to placeedit the name of the car edsel is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity naming the vehicle after edsel ford was proposed early in its development however the ford family strongly opposed its use henry ford ii declared that he did not want his fathers good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps ford also ran internal studies to decide on a name and even dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas they reached no conclusions ford retained the advertising firm foote cone  belding to come up with a name when the agency issued its report citing over  possibilities fords ernest breech commented that they had been hired to develop one name not  early favorites for the name brand included citation corsair pacer and ranger which were ultimately chosen for the vehicles series names david wallace manager of marketing research and coworker bob young unofficially invited freethinker poet marianne moore for input and suggestions moores unorthodox contributions among them utopian turtletop pastelogram turcotinga resilient bullet andante con moto and mongoose civique were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature by the instruction of ernest breech who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of henry ford ii the car was finally called edsel in honor of edsel ford former company president and son of henry ford reliabilityedit even though the edsel shared its basic technology with other ford products a number of issues caused reliability problems mostly with the  models reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other ford models ford never dedicated a standalone factory solely to edsel model production the firstyear  edsels were assembled in both mercury and ford factories the longerwheelbase models citation and corsair were produced alongside the mercury products while the shorterwheelbase models pacer and ranger were produced alongside the ford products workers assembling fords and mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional edsel that moved down the line burdensome because it required them to change tools and parts bins then switch back to resume assembling fords or mercurys after completing assembly on the edsel the workers were also expected to accommodate edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of ford and mercury production consequently the desired quality control of the different edsel models proved difficult to achieve even when the fords and mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines many edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics some of whom never installed the additional parts at all some dealers did not even receive all the parts in the march  issue of popular mechanics  of edsel owners reported poor workmanship with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure in its test car popular mechanics tested for these problems and noted others such as the trunk leaking badly in a storm and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled design controversiesedit the distinctive center grille of the  edsel the edsels most memorable design feature was its trademark horsecollar or toilet seat grille which was quite distinct from other cars of the period according to a popular joke at the time the edsel resembled an oldsmobile sucking a lemon while automotive critic neil dan cites the grilles vaginal appearance the edsels frontend ensemble as it eventually appeared bore little resemblance if any to the original concept roy brown the original chief designer on the edsel project had envisioned a slender almost delicate opening in the center engineers fearing engine cooling problems vetoed the intended design which led to the nowinfamous horsecollar the vertical grille theme while improved for the  models was discontinued for the  models which were similar to ford models of the same year although coincidentally the new frontend design was very similar to that of the  pontiac the teletouch pushbutton automatic transmission selector was an extremely complex feature it proved problematic in part because the steering wheel hub where the pushbuttons were located was the traditional location of the horn button some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn while the edsel was fast the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing there were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons d for drag l for leap and r for race instead of drive low and reverse the control wires for teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and in some cases complete failure the electrical design required drivers to shift from park to reverse to neutral to drive in that order to avoid overloading the teletouch motor the motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of park while on a hill so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the park button complaints also surfaced about the taillights on model edsel station wagons the lenses were boomerangshaped and placed in a reverse fashion at a distance they appeared as arrows pointed in the opposite direction of the turn being made when the left turn signal flashed its arrow shape pointed right and vice versa however there was little that could be done to give the fordbased station wagons a unique appearance from the rear because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed only the taillights and trim could be touched there was room for separate turn signals in addition to the boomerangs but the us industry had never supplied them up to that point and they were probably never seriously considered mechanics of the time were wary of the cubicinch edsel e engine because its perfectly flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers the heads were set at an angle with roof pistons forming both a squish zone on one side and a combustion chamber on the other combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore this design was similar to chevrolets cubicinch w engine which was also introduced in  while the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics company politics and the role of robert mcnamaraedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september  learn how and when to remove this template message an intriguing aspect of the edsel story is that it provides a case study in how company politics can kill an idea while the car and ford’s planning of the car are the most often cited reasons for its failure internal ford motor company memoranda indicate that the edsel may actually have been a victim of dissension within fords management ranks following world war ii henry ford ii retained robert mcnamara as one of the whiz kids to help turn ford around mcnamara’s costcutting and costcontainment skills helped ford emerge from its nearcollapse after the war as a result mcnamara eventually amassed a considerable amount of power at ford mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that like the elder ford mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the companys other products thus mcnamara had little use for the continental lincoln mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company mcnamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for continental lincoln mercury and edsel cars and moved to consolidate lincoln mercury and edsel into the mel division mcnamara saw to it that the continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the lincoln range for  he next set his sights on edsel by maneuvering for elimination of the dual wheelbases and separate bodies used in  instead the edsel would share the ford platform and use ford’s inner body structure for  in  the edsel emerged as little more than a ford with different trim mcnamara also moved to reduce edsel’s advertising budget for  and for  he virtually eliminated it the final blow came in the fall of  when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of fords management that the edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before the edsel bled the company dry mcnamara also attempted to discontinue the lincoln nameplate but that effort ended with elwood engels now classic redesign of  mcnamara left ford when he was named secretary of defense by president john f kennedy during the  presidential election republican nominee barry goldwater blamed mcnamara then secretary of defense for the edsels failure eventually fords former executive vice president ernest r breech who was a financial contributor to goldwater wrote to the senators campaign explaining that mr mcnamara… had nothing to do with the plans for the edsel car or any part of the program however the charge continued to be leveled against mcnamara for years during his time as head of the world bank mcnamara instructed his public affairs officer to distribute copies of breechs letter to the press whenever the accusation was made the edsel cometedit the scheduled  edsel comet compact car was hastily rebranded as the comet and assigned to lincolnmercury dealerships as a standalone product based on the

with the continental broken out as a separate make at the top of fords product line and to add a premiumintermediate vehicle to the intermediate slot vacated by lincolncitation neededoriginal research marketing research and development for the new intermediate line had begun in  under the code name e car which stood for experimental car ford motor company eventually decided on the name edsel in honor of edsel b ford son of the companys founder henry ford despite objections from henry ford ii the proposed vehicle marque would represent the startup of a new division of the firm alongside that of ford itself and the lincolnmercury division whose cars at the time shared the same bodies ford later claimed to have performed more than adequate if not superior product development and market research work in the planning and design of the new vehicle particularly ford assured its investors and the detroit automotive press that the edsel was not only a superior product as compared to its oldsmobilebuickdesoto competition but the details of its styling and specifications were the result of a sophisticated market analysis and research and development effort that would essentially guarantee its broad acceptance by the buying public when the car was introduced its elegance its engines its exciting new features make other cars seem ordinary edsel advertisement  the edsel was introduced amid considerable publicity on e day—september   it was also promoted by a toprated television special the edsel show on october  but the promotional effort was not enough to counter the adverse initial public reaction to the cars styling and conventional build the day after its launch the edsel was described as a reborn lasalle a brand that had disappeared in  for months ford had been telling the industry press that it knew through its market research that there would be great demand for the vehicle ford also insisted that in the edsel it had built exactly the entirely new kind of car that ford had been leading the buying public to expect through its preintroduction publicity campaign for the car in reality however the edsel shared its engineering and bodywork with other ford models and the similarities were apparent once the vehicle was viewed firsthand the edsel was to be sold through a newly formed division of the ford motor company as a companion to the ford division mercury division lincoln division and newly formed but also shortlived continental division each division had its own retail organization and dealer network the freestanding edsel division existed from november  until january  after which edsel sales and marketing operations were integrated into the mercuryedsellincoln division referred to as mel initially edsel was sold through a new network of approximately  dealers this briefly brought the total number of dealers of all ford products to  ford saw this as a way to come closer to parity with chrysler which had  dealers and general motors which had  as soon as it became apparent that the edsels were not selling many of these dealers added lincolnmercury ford of britain or ford of germany franchises to their dealerships with the encouragement of ford motor company some dealers however closed a  edsel pacer door hardtop for the  model year ford produced four submodels of edsel the larger mercurybased citation and corsair and the smaller fordbased pacer and ranger the citation was offered in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop and twodoor convertible versions the corsair was available in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop versions the pacer was available as a twodoor or fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan or twodoor convertible the ranger was sold in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop or sedan versions the fourdoor bermuda and villager wagons and the twodoor roundup wagon were based on the inch wheelbase ford station wagon platform and shared the trim and features of the ranger and pacer models the edsel offered several features that were considered innovative for the time including its rollingdome speedometer warning lights for such conditions as low oil level parking brake engaged and engine overheating and its pushbutton teletouch transmission shifting system in the center of the steering wheel a conventional columnshift automatic was also available at a reduced price other edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and selfadjusting brakes which ford claimed for the edsel as a first for the industry even though studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade the edsel also offered such advanced features for the time as seat belts which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes and childproof rear door locks that could only be opened with the key edsel ranger interior showing the teletouch system and rolling dome speedometer unlike ford and mercury the edsel division never had any dedicated manufacturing plants all edsels were built in ford or mercury plants on a contract basis in the first year  edsels were sold in the united states and  were sold in canada though below expectations this nevertheless represented the secondlargest launch for any new car brand to date exceeded only by the desoto introduction in  for the  model year the edsel brand fielded only two series the fordbased ranger and corsair the larger mercurybased edsels were discontinued replacing the pacer as the topline fordbased edsel the new corsair was offered as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan and twodoor convertible the ranger was sold as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop twodoor and fourdoor sedan and the villager station wagon in the  model year  edsels were sold in the us and  were sold in canada for the  model year edsels last only  vehicles were produced all but the pilot cars were assembled at the louisville kentucky assembly plant the marque was reduced to the ranger series of sedans hardtops convertibles and the villager station wagons the edsel shared its basic chassis glass and major sheet metal with the  ford galaxie and fairlane models that were built on the louisville assembly line with it but the edsel had its own unique grille hood and four upright oblong taillights along with its sidesweep spears the edsels front and rear bumpers were also unique the  edsel rode on a inch wheelbase compared to the concurrent fords inch span and it also used a different rear suspension the cars did however share engines and transmissions the  edsel ranger fourdoor hardtop model used the thinpillar ford fairlane fourdoor sedan roofline as opposed to the square roofline used on the corresponding ford fourdoor hardtop which was exclusive to the galaxie line the galaxie fourdoor hardtops rear door trim panel however was fitted to the ranger this gave the edsel fourdoor hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any  ford end of the edseledit  edsel ranger sedan ford announced the end of the edsel program on november   however production continued until late in november with the final tally of  model year  cars total edsel sales were approximately  less than half the companys projected breakeven point the company lost  million or the equivalent of  in  dollars on the venture only  edsels were built including  produced in ontario canada by us auto industry standards these production figures were dismal particularly when spread across a run of three model years on friday november  united press internationals upi wire service reported that book values for used edsels had declined by as much as  based on condition and age immediately following the ford press release in some newspaper markets dealers scrambled to renegotiate newspaper advertising contracts involving the  edsel models while others dropped the name from their dealerships advertising entirely ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased  models and carryover  models prior to the announcement valued at  to  toward the purchase of new ford products to offset the decreased values the company also issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received following the announcement edsel and its failuresedit historians have advanced several theories in an effort to explain the edsels failure popular culture often faults the car’s styling consumer reports has alleged that poor workmanship was the edsels chief problem marketing experts hold the edsel up as a supreme example of the corporate culture’s failure to understand american consumers business analysts cite the weak internal support for the product inside ford’s executive offices according to author and edsel scholar jan deutsch the edsel was the wrong car at the wrong time the aim was right but the target movededit the edsel is most notorious for being a marketing disaster indeed the name edsel became synonymous with the reallife commercial failure of the predicted perfect product or product idea similar illfated products have often been colloquially referred to as edsels fords own sierra model which launched almost  years later is often compared to the edsel owing to initial buyer antipathy to its perceived radical styling even though unlike the edsel it ultimately became a sales success since the edsel program was such a debacle it gave marketers a vivid illustration of how not to market a product the principal reason the edsels failure is so infamous is that ford had absolutely no idea that the failure was going to happen until after the vehicles had been designed and built the dealerships established and  million invested in the products development and launch incredibly ford had presumed to invest  million well over  billion in the st century in developing a new product line without attempting to determine whether such an investment would be wise or prudent the prerelease advertising campaign promoted the car as having more you ideas and the teaser advertisements in magazines only revealed glimpses of the car through a highly blurred lens or wrapped in paper or under tarps in fact ford had never “test marketed” the vehicle or its unique styling concepts with potential “real” buyers prior to either the vehicle’s initial development decision or the vehicle’s shipments to its new dealerships edsels were shipped to the dealerships undercover and remained wrapped on the dealer lots the public also had difficulty understanding what the edsel was primarily because ford made the mistake of pricing the edsel within mercury’s market price segment theoretically the edsel was conceived to fit into ford’s marketing structure as the brand slotted in between ford and mercury however when the car debuted in  its least expensive model—the ranger—was priced within  of the most expensive and besttrimmed ford sedan and  less than mercury’s base medalist model in its midrange pricing edsels pacer and corsair models were more expensive than their mercury counterparts edsels topoftheline citation fourdoor hardtop model was the only model priced to correctly compete with mercury’s midrange montclair turnpike cruiser model as illustrated in the chart below  ford motor company pricing fob structure ford edsel mercury lincoln continental – capri – premiere – park lane – citation – montclair – corsair – pacer – monterey – fairlane  – ranger – medalist – galaxie  – custom  – not only was the edsel competing against its own sister divisions but model for model buyers did not understand what the car was supposed to be—a step above the mercury or a step below it after its introduction to the public the edsel did not live up to its preproduction publicity even though it did offer many new features such as selfadjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication while fords market research had indicated that these and other features would make the e car attractive to them as car buyers the edsels selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay upon seeing the price for a base model many potential buyers simply left the dealerships other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped topoftheline model the wrong car at the wrong timeedit one of the external forces working against the edsel was the onset of an economic recession in late  compounding edsels problems was the fact that the car had to compete with wellestablished nameplates from the big three such as pontiac oldsmobile buick dodge and desoto as well as with its own internal sister division mercury which itself had never been a stellar sales success to make matters still worse as a new make edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers as its competing makes had even if the – recession had not occurred the edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace in the early s when the e car was in its earliest stages of development ford executive vice president ernest r breech had convinced ford management that the mediumpriced market segment offered great untapped opportunity at the time breechs assessment was basically correct in  pontiac buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units but by the fall of  when the edsel was introduced the market had changed drastically independent manufacturers in the mediumpriced field were drifting toward insolvency hoping to reverse its losses packard acquired studebaker which was also in financial difficulty the board decided to stop production under the venerable packard badge after  the – packards were little more than studebakers badged as packards attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its premerger brands nash and hudson after the  model year sales of chryslers desoto marque dropped dramatically from its  high by over  in  when desoto sales failed to rebound during the  model year plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by  indeed sales for most car manufacturers even those not introducing new models were down among domestic makes only rambler and lincoln produced more cars in  than in  customers started buying more fuelefficient automobiles particularly volkswagen beetles which were selling at rates exceeding  a year in the us from  onward edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration but they also required premium fuel and their fuel economy especially in city driving was poor even by lates standards ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury by  buyers had become fascinated with economy cars and a large car like the edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own when ford introduced the falcon in  it sold over  units in its first year fords investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the edsel helped make the companys subsequent success with the falcon possible by  the market for mediumpriced cars had recovered and this time ford had the right car the galaxie  ltd the ltds success led chevrolet to introduce the caprice as a mid upscale trim option on its topoftheline impala fourdoor hardtop edsel a difficult name to placeedit the name of the car edsel is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity naming the vehicle after edsel ford was proposed early in its development however the ford family strongly opposed its use henry ford ii declared that he did not want his fathers good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps ford also ran internal studies to decide on a name and even dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas they reached no conclusions ford retained the advertising firm foote cone  belding to come up with a name when the agency issued its report citing over  possibilities fords ernest breech commented that they had been hired to develop one name not  early favorites for the name brand included citation corsair pacer and ranger which were ultimately chosen for the vehicles series names david wallace manager of marketing research and coworker bob young unofficially invited freethinker poet marianne moore for input and suggestions moores unorthodox contributions among them utopian turtletop pastelogram turcotinga resilient bullet andante con moto and mongoose civique were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature by the instruction of ernest breech who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of henry ford ii the car was finally called edsel in honor of edsel ford former company president and son of henry ford reliabilityedit even though the edsel shared its basic technology with other ford products a number of issues caused reliability problems mostly with the  models reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other ford models ford never dedicated a standalone factory solely to edsel model production the firstyear  edsels were assembled in both mercury and ford factories the longerwheelbase models citation and corsair were produced alongside the mercury products while the shorterwheelbase models pacer and ranger were produced alongside the ford products workers assembling fords and mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional edsel that moved down the line burdensome because it required them to change tools and parts bins then switch back to resume assembling fords or mercurys after completing assembly on the edsel the workers were also expected to accommodate edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of ford and mercury production consequently the desired quality control of the different edsel models proved difficult to achieve even when the fords and mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines many edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics some of whom never installed the additional parts at all some dealers did not even receive all the parts in the march  issue of popular mechanics  of edsel owners reported poor workmanship with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure in its test car popular mechanics tested for these problems and noted others such as the trunk leaking badly in a storm and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled design controversiesedit the distinctive center grille of the  edsel the edsels most memorable design feature was its trademark horsecollar or toilet seat grille which was quite distinct from other cars of the period according to a popular joke at the time the edsel resembled an oldsmobile sucking a lemon while automotive critic neil dan cites the grilles vaginal appearance the edsels frontend ensemble as it eventually appeared bore little resemblance if any to the original concept roy brown the original chief designer on the edsel project had envisioned a slender almost delicate opening in the center engineers fearing engine cooling problems vetoed the intended design which led to the nowinfamous horsecollar the vertical grille theme while improved for the  models was discontinued for the  models which were similar to ford models of the same year although coincidentally the new frontend design was very similar to that of the  pontiac the teletouch pushbutton automatic transmission selector was an extremely complex feature it proved problematic in part because the steering wheel hub where the pushbuttons were located was the traditional location of the horn button some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn while the edsel was fast the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing there were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons d for drag l for leap and r for race instead of drive low and reverse the control wires for teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and in some cases complete failure the electrical design required drivers to shift from park to reverse to neutral to drive in that order to avoid overloading the teletouch motor the motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of park while on a hill so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the park button complaints also surfaced about the taillights on model edsel station wagons the lenses were boomerangshaped and placed in a reverse fashion at a distance they appeared as arrows pointed in the opposite direction of the turn being made when the left turn signal flashed its arrow shape pointed right and vice versa however there was little that could be done to give the fordbased station wagons a unique appearance from the rear because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed only the taillights and trim could be touched there was room for separate turn signals in addition to the boomerangs but the us industry had never supplied them up to that point and they were probably never seriously considered mechanics of the time were wary of the cubicinch edsel e engine because its perfectly flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers the heads were set at an angle with roof pistons forming both a squish zone on one side and a combustion chamber on the other combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore this design was similar to chevrolets cubicinch w engine which was also introduced in  while the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics company politics and the role of robert mcnamaraedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september  learn how and when to remove this template message an intriguing aspect of the edsel story is that it provides a case study in how company politics can kill an idea while the car and ford’s planning of the car are the most often cited reasons for its failure internal ford motor company memoranda indicate that the edsel may actually have been a victim of dissension within fords management ranks following world war ii henry ford ii retained robert mcnamara as one of the whiz kids to help turn ford around mcnamara’s costcutting and costcontainment skills helped ford emerge from its nearcollapse after the war as a result mcnamara eventually amassed a considerable amount of power at ford mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that like the elder ford mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the companys other products thus mcnamara had little use for the continental lincoln mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company mcnamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for continental lincoln mercury and edsel cars and moved to consolidate lincoln mercury and edsel into the mel division mcnamara saw to it that the continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the lincoln range for  he next set his sights on edsel by maneuvering for elimination of the dual wheelbases and separate bodies used in  instead the edsel would share the ford platform and use ford’s inner body structure for  in  the edsel emerged as little more than a ford with different trim mcnamara also moved to reduce edsel’s advertising budget for  and for  he virtually eliminated it the final blow came in the fall of  when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of fords management that the edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before the edsel bled the company dry mcnamara also attempted to discontinue the lincoln nameplate but that effort ended with elwood engels now classic redesign of  mcnamara left ford when he was named secretary of defense by president john f kennedy during the  presidential election republican nominee barry goldwater blamed mcnamara then secretary of defense for the edsels failure eventually fords former executive vice president ernest r breech who was a financial contributor to goldwater wrote to the senators campaign explaining that mr mcnamara… had nothing to do with the plans for the edsel car or any part of the program however the charge continued to be leveled against mcnamara for years during his time as head of the world bank mcnamara instructed his public affairs officer to distribute copies of breechs letter to the press whenever the accusation was made the edsel cometedit the scheduled  edsel comet compact car was hastily rebranded as the comet and assigned to lincolnmercury dealerships as a standalone product based on the

oldsmobilebuickdesoto competition but the details of its styling and specifications were the result of a sophisticated market analysis and research and development effort that would essentially guarantee its broad acceptance by the buying public when the car was introduced its elegance its engines its exciting new features make other cars seem ordinary edsel advertisement  the edsel was introduced amid considerable publicity on e day—september   it was also promoted by a toprated television special the edsel show on october  but the promotional effort was not enough to counter the adverse initial public reaction to the cars styling and conventional build the day after its launch the edsel was described as a reborn lasalle a brand that had disappeared in  for months ford had been telling the industry press that it knew through its market research that there would be great demand for the vehicle ford also insisted that in the edsel it had built exactly the entirely new kind of car that ford had been leading the buying public to expect through its preintroduction publicity campaign for the car in reality however the edsel shared its engineering and bodywork with other ford models and the similarities were apparent once the vehicle was viewed firsthand the edsel was to be sold through a newly formed division of the ford motor company as a companion to the ford division mercury division lincoln division and newly formed but also shortlived continental division each division had its own retail organization and dealer network the freestanding edsel division existed from november  until january  after which edsel sales and marketing operations were integrated into the mercuryedsellincoln division referred to as mel initially edsel was sold through a new network of approximately  dealers this briefly brought the total number of dealers of all ford products to  ford saw this as a way to come closer to parity with chrysler which had  dealers and general motors which had  as soon as it became apparent that the edsels were not selling many of these dealers added lincolnmercury ford of britain or ford of germany franchises to their dealerships with the encouragement of ford motor company some dealers however closed a  edsel pacer door hardtop for the  model year ford produced four submodels of edsel the larger mercurybased citation and corsair and the smaller fordbased pacer and ranger the citation was offered in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop and twodoor convertible versions the corsair was available in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop versions the pacer was available as a twodoor or fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan or twodoor convertible the ranger was sold in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop or sedan versions the fourdoor bermuda and villager wagons and the twodoor roundup wagon were based on the inch wheelbase ford station wagon platform and shared the trim and features of the ranger and pacer models the edsel offered several features that were considered innovative for the time including its rollingdome speedometer warning lights for such conditions as low oil level parking brake engaged and engine overheating and its pushbutton teletouch transmission shifting system in the center of the steering wheel a conventional columnshift automatic was also available at a reduced price other edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and selfadjusting brakes which ford claimed for the edsel as a first for the industry even though studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade the edsel also offered such advanced features for the time as seat belts which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes and childproof rear door locks that could only be opened with the key edsel ranger interior showing the teletouch system and rolling dome speedometer unlike ford and mercury the edsel division never had any dedicated manufacturing plants all edsels were built in ford or mercury plants on a contract basis in the first year  edsels were sold in the united states and  were sold in canada though below expectations this nevertheless represented the secondlargest launch for any new car brand to date exceeded only by the desoto introduction in  for the  model year the edsel brand fielded only two series the fordbased ranger and corsair the larger mercurybased edsels were discontinued replacing the pacer as the topline fordbased edsel the new corsair was offered as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan and twodoor convertible the ranger was sold as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop twodoor and fourdoor sedan and the villager station wagon in the  model year  edsels were sold in the us and  were sold in canada for the  model year edsels last only  vehicles were produced all but the pilot cars were assembled at the louisville kentucky assembly plant the marque was reduced to the ranger series of sedans hardtops convertibles and the villager station wagons the edsel shared its basic chassis glass and major sheet metal with the  ford galaxie and fairlane models that were built on the louisville assembly line with it but the edsel had its own unique grille hood and four upright oblong taillights along with its sidesweep spears the edsels front and rear bumpers were also unique the  edsel rode on a inch wheelbase compared to the concurrent fords inch span and it also used a different rear suspension the cars did however share engines and transmissions the  edsel ranger fourdoor hardtop model used the thinpillar ford fairlane fourdoor sedan roofline as opposed to the square roofline used on the corresponding ford fourdoor hardtop which was exclusive to the galaxie line the galaxie fourdoor hardtops rear door trim panel however was fitted to the ranger this gave the edsel fourdoor hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any  ford end of the edseledit  edsel ranger sedan ford announced the end of the edsel program on november   however production continued until late in november with the final tally of  model year  cars total edsel sales were approximately  less than half the companys projected breakeven point the company lost  million or the equivalent of  in  dollars on the venture only  edsels were built including  produced in ontario canada by us auto industry standards these production figures were dismal particularly when spread across a run of three model years on friday november  united press internationals upi wire service reported that book values for used edsels had declined by as much as  based on condition and age immediately following the ford press release in some newspaper markets dealers scrambled to renegotiate newspaper advertising contracts involving the  edsel models while others dropped the name from their dealerships advertising entirely ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased  models and carryover  models prior to the announcement valued at  to  toward the purchase of new ford products to offset the decreased values the company also issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received following the announcement edsel and its failuresedit historians have advanced several theories in an effort to explain the edsels failure popular culture often faults the car’s styling consumer reports has alleged that poor workmanship was the edsels chief problem marketing experts hold the edsel up as a supreme example of the corporate culture’s failure to understand american consumers business analysts cite the weak internal support for the product inside ford’s executive offices according to author and edsel scholar jan deutsch the edsel was the wrong car at the wrong time the aim was right but the target movededit the edsel is most notorious for being a marketing disaster indeed the name edsel became synonymous with the reallife commercial failure of the predicted perfect product or product idea similar illfated products have often been colloquially referred to as edsels fords own sierra model which launched almost  years later is often compared to the edsel owing to initial buyer antipathy to its perceived radical styling even though unlike the edsel it ultimately became a sales success since the edsel program was such a debacle it gave marketers a vivid illustration of how not to market a product the principal reason the edsels failure is so infamous is that ford had absolutely no idea that the failure was going to happen until after the vehicles had been designed and built the dealerships established and  million invested in the products development and launch incredibly ford had presumed to invest  million well over  billion in the st century in developing a new product line without attempting to determine whether such an investment would be wise or prudent the prerelease advertising campaign promoted the car as having more you ideas and the teaser advertisements in magazines only revealed glimpses of the car through a highly blurred lens or wrapped in paper or under tarps in fact ford had never “test marketed” the vehicle or its unique styling concepts with potential “real” buyers prior to either the vehicle’s initial development decision or the vehicle’s shipments to its new dealerships edsels were shipped to the dealerships undercover and remained wrapped on the dealer lots the public also had difficulty understanding what the edsel was primarily because ford made the mistake of pricing the edsel within mercury’s market price segment theoretically the edsel was conceived to fit into ford’s marketing structure as the brand slotted in between ford and mercury however when the car debuted in  its least expensive model—the ranger—was priced within  of the most expensive and besttrimmed ford sedan and  less than mercury’s base medalist model in its midrange pricing edsels pacer and corsair models were more expensive than their mercury counterparts edsels topoftheline citation fourdoor hardtop model was the only model priced to correctly compete with mercury’s midrange montclair turnpike cruiser model as illustrated in the chart below  ford motor company pricing fob structure ford edsel mercury lincoln continental – capri – premiere – park lane – citation – montclair – corsair – pacer – monterey – fairlane  – ranger – medalist – galaxie  – custom  – not only was the edsel competing against its own sister divisions but model for model buyers did not understand what the car was supposed to be—a step above the mercury or a step below it after its introduction to the public the edsel did not live up to its preproduction publicity even though it did offer many new features such as selfadjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication while fords market research had indicated that these and other features would make the e car attractive to them as car buyers the edsels selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay upon seeing the price for a base model many potential buyers simply left the dealerships other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped topoftheline model the wrong car at the wrong timeedit one of the external forces working against the edsel was the onset of an economic recession in late  compounding edsels problems was the fact that the car had to compete with wellestablished nameplates from the big three such as pontiac oldsmobile buick dodge and desoto as well as with its own internal sister division mercury which itself had never been a stellar sales success to make matters still worse as a new make edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers as its competing makes had even if the – recession had not occurred the edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace in the early s when the e car was in its earliest stages of development ford executive vice president ernest r breech had convinced ford management that the mediumpriced market segment offered great untapped opportunity at the time breechs assessment was basically correct in  pontiac buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units but by the fall of  when the edsel was introduced the market had changed drastically independent manufacturers in the mediumpriced field were drifting toward insolvency hoping to reverse its losses packard acquired studebaker which was also in financial difficulty the board decided to stop production under the venerable packard badge after  the – packards were little more than studebakers badged as packards attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its premerger brands nash and hudson after the  model year sales of chryslers desoto marque dropped dramatically from its  high by over  in  when desoto sales failed to rebound during the  model year plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by  indeed sales for most car manufacturers even those not introducing new models were down among domestic makes only rambler and lincoln produced more cars in  than in  customers started buying more fuelefficient automobiles particularly volkswagen beetles which were selling at rates exceeding  a year in the us from  onward edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration but they also required premium fuel and their fuel economy especially in city driving was poor even by lates standards ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury by  buyers had become fascinated with economy cars and a large car like the edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own when ford introduced the falcon in  it sold over  units in its first year fords investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the edsel helped make the companys subsequent success with the falcon possible by  the market for mediumpriced cars had recovered and this time ford had the right car the galaxie  ltd the ltds success led chevrolet to introduce the caprice as a mid upscale trim option on its topoftheline impala fourdoor hardtop edsel a difficult name to placeedit the name of the car edsel is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity naming the vehicle after edsel ford was proposed early in its development however the ford family strongly opposed its use henry ford ii declared that he did not want his fathers good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps ford also ran internal studies to decide on a name and even dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas they reached no conclusions ford retained the advertising firm foote cone  belding to come up with a name when the agency issued its report citing over  possibilities fords ernest breech commented that they had been hired to develop one name not  early favorites for the name brand included citation corsair pacer and ranger which were ultimately chosen for the vehicles series names david wallace manager of marketing research and coworker bob young unofficially invited freethinker poet marianne moore for input and suggestions moores unorthodox contributions among them utopian turtletop pastelogram turcotinga resilient bullet andante con moto and mongoose civique were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature by the instruction of ernest breech who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of henry ford ii the car was finally called edsel in honor of edsel ford former company president and son of henry ford reliabilityedit even though the edsel shared its basic technology with other ford products a number of issues caused reliability problems mostly with the  models reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other ford models ford never dedicated a standalone factory solely to edsel model production the firstyear  edsels were assembled in both mercury and ford factories the longerwheelbase models citation and corsair were produced alongside the mercury products while the shorterwheelbase models pacer and ranger were produced alongside the ford products workers assembling fords and mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional edsel that moved down the line burdensome because it required them to change tools and parts bins then switch back to resume assembling fords or mercurys after completing assembly on the edsel the workers were also expected to accommodate edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of ford and mercury production consequently the desired quality control of the different edsel models proved difficult to achieve even when the fords and mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines many edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics some of whom never installed the additional parts at all some dealers did not even receive all the parts in the march  issue of popular mechanics  of edsel owners reported poor workmanship with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure in its test car popular mechanics tested for these problems and noted others such as the trunk leaking badly in a storm and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled design controversiesedit the distinctive center grille of the  edsel the edsels most memorable design feature was its trademark horsecollar or toilet seat grille which was quite distinct from other cars of the period according to a popular joke at the time the edsel resembled an oldsmobile sucking a lemon while automotive critic neil dan cites the grilles vaginal appearance the edsels frontend ensemble as it eventually appeared bore little resemblance if any to the original concept roy brown the original chief designer on the edsel project had envisioned a slender almost delicate opening in the center engineers fearing engine cooling problems vetoed the intended design which led to the nowinfamous horsecollar the vertical grille theme while improved for the  models was discontinued for the  models which were similar to ford models of the same year although coincidentally the new frontend design was very similar to that of the  pontiac the teletouch pushbutton automatic transmission selector was an extremely complex feature it proved problematic in part because the steering wheel hub where the pushbuttons were located was the traditional location of the horn button some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn while the edsel was fast the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing there were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons d for drag l for leap and r for race instead of drive low and reverse the control wires for teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and in some cases complete failure the electrical design required drivers to shift from park to reverse to neutral to drive in that order to avoid overloading the teletouch motor the motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of park while on a hill so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the park button complaints also surfaced about the taillights on model edsel station wagons the lenses were boomerangshaped and placed in a reverse fashion at a distance they appeared as arrows pointed in the opposite direction of the turn being made when the left turn signal flashed its arrow shape pointed right and vice versa however there was little that could be done to give the fordbased station wagons a unique appearance from the rear because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed only the taillights and trim could be touched there was room for separate turn signals in addition to the boomerangs but the us industry had never supplied them up to that point and they were probably never seriously considered mechanics of the time were wary of the cubicinch edsel e engine because its perfectly flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers the heads were set at an angle with roof pistons forming both a squish zone on one side and a combustion chamber on the other combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore this design was similar to chevrolets cubicinch w engine which was also introduced in  while the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics company politics and the role of robert mcnamaraedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september  learn how and when to remove this template message an intriguing aspect of the edsel story is that it provides a case study in how company politics can kill an idea while the car and ford’s planning of the car are the most often cited reasons for its failure internal ford motor company memoranda indicate that the edsel may actually have been a victim of dissension within fords management ranks following world war ii henry ford ii retained robert mcnamara as one of the whiz kids to help turn ford around mcnamara’s costcutting and costcontainment skills helped ford emerge from its nearcollapse after the war as a result mcnamara eventually amassed a considerable amount of power at ford mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that like the elder ford mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the companys other products thus mcnamara had little use for the continental lincoln mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company mcnamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for continental lincoln mercury and edsel cars and moved to consolidate lincoln mercury and edsel into the mel division mcnamara saw to it that the continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the lincoln range for  he next set his sights on edsel by maneuvering for elimination of the dual wheelbases and separate bodies used in  instead the edsel would share the ford platform and use ford’s inner body structure for  in  the edsel emerged as little more than a ford with different trim mcnamara also moved to reduce edsel’s advertising budget for  and for  he virtually eliminated it the final blow came in the fall of  when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of fords management that the edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before the edsel bled the company dry mcnamara also attempted to discontinue the lincoln nameplate but that effort ended with elwood engels now classic redesign of  mcnamara left ford when he was named secretary of defense by president john f kennedy during the  presidential election republican nominee barry goldwater blamed mcnamara then secretary of defense for the edsels failure eventually fords former executive vice president ernest r breech who was a financial contributor to goldwater wrote to the senators campaign explaining that mr mcnamara… had nothing to do with the plans for the edsel car or any part of the program however the charge continued to be leveled against mcnamara for years during his time as head of the world bank mcnamara instructed his public affairs officer to distribute copies of breechs letter to the press whenever the accusation was made the edsel cometedit the scheduled  edsel comet compact car was hastily rebranded as the comet and assigned to lincolnmercury dealerships as a standalone product based on the

sold to the public that allude to being part of the edsel family of models included the instrument cluster rear tailfins though canted diagonally and the taillight shape the lens is visually similar

other ford models and the similarities were apparent once the vehicle was viewed firsthand the edsel was to be sold through a newly formed division of the ford motor company as a companion to the ford

the smaller fordbased pacer and ranger the citation was offered in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop and twodoor convertible versions the corsair was available in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop versions the pacer was available as a twodoor or fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan or twodoor convertible the ranger was sold in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop or sedan versions the fourdoor bermuda and villager wagons and the twodoor roundup wagon were based on the inch wheelbase ford station wagon platform and shared the trim and features of the ranger and pacer models the edsel offered several features that were considered innovative for the time including its rollingdome speedometer warning lights for such conditions as low oil level parking brake engaged and engine overheating and its pushbutton teletouch transmission shifting system in the center of the steering wheel a conventional columnshift automatic was also available at a reduced price other edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and selfadjusting brakes which ford claimed for the edsel as a first for the industry even though studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade the edsel also offered such advanced features for the time as seat belts which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes and childproof rear door locks that could only be opened with the key edsel ranger interior showing the teletouch system and rolling dome speedometer unlike ford and mercury the edsel division never had any dedicated manufacturing plants all edsels were built in ford or mercury plants on a contract basis in the first year  edsels were sold in the united states and  were sold in canada though below expectations this nevertheless represented the secondlargest launch for any new car brand to date exceeded only by the desoto introduction in  for the  model year the edsel brand fielded only two series the fordbased ranger and corsair the larger mercurybased edsels were discontinued replacing the pacer as the topline fordbased edsel the new corsair was offered as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan and twodoor convertible the ranger was sold as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop twodoor and fourdoor sedan and the villager station wagon in the  model year  edsels were sold in the us and  were sold in canada for the  model year edsels last only  vehicles were produced all but the pilot cars were assembled at the louisville kentucky assembly plant the marque was reduced to the ranger series of sedans hardtops convertibles and the villager station wagons the edsel shared its basic chassis glass and major sheet metal with the  ford galaxie and fairlane models that were built on the louisville assembly line with it but the edsel had its own unique grille hood and four upright oblong taillights along with its sidesweep spears the edsels front and rear bumpers were also unique the  edsel rode on a inch wheelbase compared to the concurrent fords inch span and it also used a different rear suspension the cars did however share engines and transmissions the  edsel ranger fourdoor hardtop model used the thinpillar ford fairlane fourdoor sedan roofline as opposed to the square roofline used on the corresponding ford fourdoor hardtop which was exclusive to the galaxie line the galaxie fourdoor hardtops rear door trim panel however was fitted to the ranger this gave the edsel fourdoor hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any  ford end of the edseledit  edsel ranger sedan ford announced the end of the edsel program on november   however production continued until late in november with the final tally of  model year  cars total edsel sales were approximately  less than half the companys projected breakeven point the company lost  million or the equivalent of  in  dollars on the venture only  edsels were built including  produced in ontario canada by us auto industry standards these production figures were dismal particularly when spread across a run of three model years on friday november  united press internationals upi wire service reported that book values for used edsels had declined by as much as  based on condition and age immediately following the ford press release in some newspaper markets dealers scrambled to renegotiate newspaper advertising contracts involving the  edsel models while others dropped the name from their dealerships advertising entirely ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased  models and carryover  models prior to the announcement valued at  to  toward the purchase of new ford products to offset the decreased values the company also issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received following the announcement edsel and its failuresedit historians have advanced several theories in an effort to explain the edsels failure popular culture often faults the car’s styling consumer reports has alleged that poor workmanship was the edsels chief problem marketing experts hold the edsel up as a supreme example of the corporate culture’s failure to understand american consumers business analysts cite the weak internal support for the product inside ford’s executive offices according to author and edsel scholar jan deutsch the edsel was the wrong car at the wrong time the aim was right but the target movededit the edsel is most notorious for being a marketing disaster indeed the name edsel became synonymous with the reallife commercial failure of the predicted perfect product or product idea similar illfated products have often been colloquially referred to as edsels fords own sierra model which launched almost  years later is often compared to the edsel owing to initial buyer antipathy to its perceived radical styling even though unlike the edsel it ultimately became a sales success since the edsel program was such a debacle it gave marketers a vivid illustration of how not to market a product the principal reason the edsels failure is so infamous is that ford had absolutely no idea that the failure was going to happen until after the vehicles had been designed and built the dealerships established and  million invested in the products development and launch incredibly ford had presumed to invest  million well over  billion in the st century in developing a new product line without attempting to determine whether such an investment would be wise or prudent the prerelease advertising campaign promoted the car as having more you ideas and the teaser advertisements in magazines only revealed glimpses of the car through a highly blurred lens or wrapped in paper or under tarps in fact ford had never “test marketed” the vehicle or its unique styling concepts with potential “real” buyers prior to either the vehicle’s initial development decision or the vehicle’s shipments to its new dealerships edsels were shipped to the dealerships undercover and remained wrapped on the dealer lots the public also had difficulty understanding what the edsel was primarily because ford made the mistake of pricing the edsel within mercury’s market price segment theoretically the edsel was conceived to fit into ford’s marketing structure as the brand slotted in between ford and mercury however when the car debuted in  its least expensive model—the ranger—was priced within  of the most expensive and besttrimmed ford sedan and  less than mercury’s base medalist model in its midrange pricing edsels pacer and corsair models were more expensive than their mercury counterparts edsels topoftheline citation fourdoor hardtop model was the only model priced to correctly compete with mercury’s midrange montclair turnpike cruiser model as illustrated in the chart below  ford motor company pricing fob structure ford edsel mercury lincoln continental – capri – premiere – park lane – citation – montclair – corsair – pacer – monterey – fairlane  – ranger – medalist – galaxie  – custom  – not only was the edsel competing against its own sister divisions but model for model buyers did not understand what the car was supposed to be—a step above the mercury or a step below it after its introduction to the public the edsel did not live up to its preproduction publicity even though it did offer many new features such as selfadjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication while fords market research had indicated that these and other features would make the e car attractive to them as car buyers the edsels selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay upon seeing the price for a base model many potential buyers simply left the dealerships other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped topoftheline model the wrong car at the wrong timeedit one of the external forces working against the edsel was the onset of an economic recession in late  compounding edsels problems was the fact that the car had to compete with wellestablished nameplates from the big three such as pontiac oldsmobile buick dodge and desoto as well as with its own internal sister division mercury which itself had never been a stellar sales success to make matters still worse as a new make edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers as its competing makes had even if the – recession had not occurred the edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace in the early s when the e car was in its earliest stages of development ford executive vice president ernest r breech had convinced ford management that the mediumpriced market segment offered great untapped opportunity at the time breechs assessment was basically correct in  pontiac buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units but by the fall of  when the edsel was introduced the market had changed drastically independent manufacturers in the mediumpriced field were drifting toward insolvency hoping to reverse its losses packard acquired studebaker which was also in financial difficulty the board decided to stop production under the venerable packard badge after  the – packards were little more than studebakers badged as packards attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its premerger brands nash and hudson after the  model year sales of chryslers desoto marque dropped dramatically from its  high by over  in  when desoto sales failed to rebound during the  model year plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by  indeed sales for most car manufacturers even those not introducing new models were down among domestic makes only rambler and lincoln produced more cars in  than in  customers started buying more fuelefficient automobiles particularly volkswagen beetles which were selling at rates exceeding  a year in the us from  onward edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration but they also required premium fuel and their fuel economy especially in city driving was poor even by lates standards ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury by  buyers had become fascinated with economy cars and a large car like the edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own when ford introduced the falcon in  it sold over  units in its first year fords investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the edsel helped make the companys subsequent success with the falcon possible by  the market for mediumpriced cars had recovered and this time ford had the right car the galaxie  ltd the ltds success led chevrolet to introduce the caprice as a mid upscale trim option on its topoftheline impala fourdoor hardtop edsel a difficult name to placeedit the name of the car edsel is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity naming the vehicle after edsel ford was proposed early in its development however the ford family strongly opposed its use henry ford ii declared that he did not want his fathers good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps ford also ran internal studies to decide on a name and even dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas they reached no conclusions ford retained the advertising firm foote cone  belding to come up with a name when the agency issued its report citing over  possibilities fords ernest breech commented that they had been hired to develop one name not  early favorites for the name brand included citation corsair pacer and ranger which were ultimately chosen for the vehicles series names david wallace manager of marketing research and coworker bob young unofficially invited freethinker poet marianne moore for input and suggestions moores unorthodox contributions among them utopian turtletop pastelogram turcotinga resilient bullet andante con moto and mongoose civique were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature by the instruction of ernest breech who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of henry ford ii the car was finally called edsel in honor of edsel ford former company president and son of henry ford reliabilityedit even though the edsel shared its basic technology with other ford products a number of issues caused reliability problems mostly with the  models reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other ford models ford never dedicated a standalone factory solely to edsel model production the firstyear  edsels were assembled in both mercury and ford factories the longerwheelbase models citation and corsair were produced alongside the mercury products while the shorterwheelbase models pacer and ranger were produced alongside the ford products workers assembling fords and mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional edsel that moved down the line burdensome because it required them to change tools and parts bins then switch back to resume assembling fords or mercurys after completing assembly on the edsel the workers were also expected to accommodate edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of ford and mercury production consequently the desired quality control of the different edsel models proved difficult to achieve even when the fords and mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines many edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics some of whom never installed the additional parts at all some dealers did not even receive all the parts in the march  issue of popular mechanics  of edsel owners reported poor workmanship with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure in its test car popular mechanics tested for these problems and noted others such as the trunk leaking badly in a storm and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled design controversiesedit the distinctive center grille of the  edsel the edsels most memorable design feature was its trademark horsecollar or toilet seat grille which was quite distinct from other cars of the period according to a popular joke at the time the edsel resembled an oldsmobile sucking a lemon while automotive critic neil dan cites the grilles vaginal appearance the edsels frontend ensemble as it eventually appeared bore little resemblance if any to the original concept roy brown the original chief designer on the edsel project had envisioned a slender almost delicate opening in the center engineers fearing engine cooling problems vetoed the intended design which led to the nowinfamous horsecollar the vertical grille theme while improved for the  models was discontinued for the  models which were similar to ford models of the same year although coincidentally the new frontend design was very similar to that of the  pontiac the teletouch pushbutton automatic transmission selector was an extremely complex feature it proved problematic in part because the steering wheel hub where the pushbuttons were located was the traditional location of the horn button some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn while the edsel was fast the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing there were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons d for drag l for leap and r for race instead of drive low and reverse the control wires for teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and in some cases complete failure the electrical design required drivers to shift from park to reverse to neutral to drive in that order to avoid overloading the teletouch motor the motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of park while on a hill so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the park button complaints also surfaced about the taillights on model edsel station wagons the lenses were boomerangshaped and placed in a reverse fashion at a distance they appeared as arrows pointed in the opposite direction of the turn being made when the left turn signal flashed its arrow shape pointed right and vice versa however there was little that could be done to give the fordbased station wagons a unique appearance from the rear because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed only the taillights and trim could be touched there was room for separate turn signals in addition to the boomerangs but the us industry had never supplied them up to that point and they were probably never seriously considered mechanics of the time were wary of the cubicinch edsel e engine because its perfectly flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers the heads were set at an angle with roof pistons forming both a squish zone on one side and a combustion chamber on the other combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore this design was similar to chevrolets cubicinch w engine which was also introduced in  while the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics company politics and the role of robert mcnamaraedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september  learn how and when to remove this template message an intriguing aspect of the edsel story is that it provides a case study in how company politics can kill an idea while the car and ford’s planning of the car are the most often cited reasons for its failure internal ford motor company memoranda indicate that the edsel may actually have been a victim of dissension within fords management ranks following world war ii henry ford ii retained robert mcnamara as one of the whiz kids to help turn ford around mcnamara’s costcutting and costcontainment skills helped ford emerge from its nearcollapse after the war as a result mcnamara eventually amassed a considerable amount of power at ford mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that like the elder ford mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the companys other products thus mcnamara had little use for the continental lincoln mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company mcnamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for continental lincoln mercury and edsel cars and moved to consolidate lincoln mercury and edsel into the mel division mcnamara saw to it that the continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the lincoln range for  he next set his sights on edsel by maneuvering for elimination of the dual wheelbases and separate bodies used in  instead the edsel would share the ford platform and use ford’s inner body structure for  in  the edsel emerged as little more than a ford with different trim mcnamara also moved to reduce edsel’s advertising budget for  and for  he virtually eliminated it the final blow came in the fall of  when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of fords management that the edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before the edsel bled the company dry mcnamara also attempted to discontinue the lincoln nameplate but that effort ended with elwood engels now classic redesign of  mcnamara left ford when he was named secretary of defense by president john f kennedy during the  presidential election republican nominee barry goldwater blamed mcnamara then secretary of defense for the edsels failure eventually fords former executive vice president ernest r breech who was a financial contributor to goldwater wrote to the senators campaign explaining that mr mcnamara… had nothing to do with the plans for the edsel car or any part of the program however the charge continued to be leveled against mcnamara for years during his time as head of the world bank mcnamara instructed his public affairs officer to distribute copies of breechs letter to the press whenever the accusation was made the edsel cometedit the scheduled  edsel comet compact car was hastily rebranded as the comet and assigned to lincolnmercury dealerships as a standalone product based on the newfor ford falcon the comet was an instant success selling more cars in its first year than all models of edsel produced during that marques entire threeyear run styling touches seen in the comets sold to the public that allude to being part of the edsel family of models included the instrument cluster rear tailfins though canted diagonally and the taillight shape the lens is visually similar

of ford itself and the lincolnmercury division whose cars at the time shared the same bodies ford later claimed to have performed more than adequate if not superior product development and market research work in the planning and design of the new vehicle particularly ford assured its investors and the detroit automotive press that the edsel was not only a superior product as compared to its

the smaller fordbased pacer and ranger the citation was offered in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop and twodoor convertible versions the corsair was available in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop versions the pacer was available as a twodoor or fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan or twodoor convertible the ranger was sold in twodoor and fourdoor hardtop or sedan versions the fourdoor bermuda and villager wagons and the twodoor roundup wagon were based on the inch wheelbase ford station wagon platform and shared the trim and features of the ranger and pacer models the edsel offered several features that were considered innovative for the time including its rollingdome speedometer warning lights for such conditions as low oil level parking brake engaged and engine overheating and its pushbutton teletouch transmission shifting system in the center of the steering wheel a conventional columnshift automatic was also available at a reduced price other edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and selfadjusting brakes which ford claimed for the edsel as a first for the industry even though studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade the edsel also offered such advanced features for the time as seat belts which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes and childproof rear door locks that could only be opened with the key edsel ranger interior showing the teletouch system and rolling dome speedometer unlike ford and mercury the edsel division never had any dedicated manufacturing plants all edsels were built in ford or mercury plants on a contract basis in the first year  edsels were sold in the united states and  were sold in canada though below expectations this nevertheless represented the secondlargest launch for any new car brand to date exceeded only by the desoto introduction in  for the  model year the edsel brand fielded only two series the fordbased ranger and corsair the larger mercurybased edsels were discontinued replacing the pacer as the topline fordbased edsel the new corsair was offered as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop fourdoor sedan and twodoor convertible the ranger was sold as a twodoor and fourdoor hardtop twodoor and fourdoor sedan and the villager station wagon in the  model year  edsels were sold in the us and  were sold in canada for the  model year edsels last only  vehicles were produced all but the pilot cars were assembled at the louisville kentucky assembly plant the marque was reduced to the ranger series of sedans hardtops convertibles and the villager station wagons the edsel shared its basic chassis glass and major sheet metal with the  ford galaxie and fairlane models that were built on the louisville assembly line with it but the edsel had its own unique grille hood and four upright oblong taillights along with its sidesweep spears the edsels front and rear bumpers were also unique the  edsel rode on a inch wheelbase compared to the concurrent fords inch span and it also used a different rear suspension the cars did however share engines and transmissions the  edsel ranger fourdoor hardtop model used the thinpillar ford fairlane fourdoor sedan roofline as opposed to the square roofline used on the corresponding ford fourdoor hardtop which was exclusive to the galaxie line the galaxie fourdoor hardtops rear door trim panel however was fitted to the ranger this gave the edsel fourdoor hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any  ford end of the edseledit  edsel ranger sedan ford announced the end of the edsel program on november   however production continued until late in november with the final tally of  model year  cars total edsel sales were approximately  less than half the companys projected breakeven point the company lost  million or the equivalent of  in  dollars on the venture only  edsels were built including  produced in ontario canada by us auto industry standards these production figures were dismal particularly when spread across a run of three model years on friday november  united press internationals upi wire service reported that book values for used edsels had declined by as much as  based on condition and age immediately following the ford press release in some newspaper markets dealers scrambled to renegotiate newspaper advertising contracts involving the  edsel models while others dropped the name from their dealerships advertising entirely ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased  models and carryover  models prior to the announcement valued at  to  toward the purchase of new ford products to offset the decreased values the company also issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received following the announcement edsel and its failuresedit historians have advanced several theories in an effort to explain the edsels failure popular culture often faults the car’s styling consumer reports has alleged that poor workmanship was the edsels chief problem marketing experts hold the edsel up as a supreme example of the corporate culture’s failure to understand american consumers business analysts cite the weak internal support for the product inside ford’s executive offices according to author and edsel scholar jan deutsch the edsel was the wrong car at the wrong time the aim was right but the target movededit the edsel is most notorious for being a marketing disaster indeed the name edsel became synonymous with the reallife commercial failure of the predicted perfect product or product idea similar illfated products have often been colloquially referred to as edsels fords own sierra model which launched almost  years later is often compared to the edsel owing to initial buyer antipathy to its perceived radical styling even though unlike the edsel it ultimately became a sales success since the edsel program was such a debacle it gave marketers a vivid illustration of how not to market a product the principal reason the edsels failure is so infamous is that ford had absolutely no idea that the failure was going to happen until after the vehicles had been designed and built the dealerships established and  million invested in the products development and launch incredibly ford had presumed to invest  million well over  billion in the st century in developing a new product line without attempting to determine whether such an investment would be wise or prudent the prerelease advertising campaign promoted the car as having more you ideas and the teaser advertisements in magazines only revealed glimpses of the car through a highly blurred lens or wrapped in paper or under tarps in fact ford had never “test marketed” the vehicle or its unique styling concepts with potential “real” buyers prior to either the vehicle’s initial development decision or the vehicle’s shipments to its new dealerships edsels were shipped to the dealerships undercover and remained wrapped on the dealer lots the public also had difficulty understanding what the edsel was primarily because ford made the mistake of pricing the edsel within mercury’s market price segment theoretically the edsel was conceived to fit into ford’s marketing structure as the brand slotted in between ford and mercury however when the car debuted in  its least expensive model—the ranger—was priced within  of the most expensive and besttrimmed ford sedan and  less than mercury’s base medalist model in its midrange pricing edsels pacer and corsair models were more expensive than their mercury counterparts edsels topoftheline citation fourdoor hardtop model was the only model priced to correctly compete with mercury’s midrange montclair turnpike cruiser model as illustrated in the chart below  ford motor company pricing fob structure ford edsel mercury lincoln continental – capri – premiere – park lane – citation – montclair – corsair – pacer – monterey – fairlane  – ranger – medalist – galaxie  – custom  – not only was the edsel competing against its own sister divisions but model for model buyers did not understand what the car was supposed to be—a step above the mercury or a step below it after its introduction to the public the edsel did not live up to its preproduction publicity even though it did offer many new features such as selfadjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication while fords market research had indicated that these and other features would make the e car attractive to them as car buyers the edsels selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay upon seeing the price for a base model many potential buyers simply left the dealerships other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped topoftheline model the wrong car at the wrong timeedit one of the external forces working against the edsel was the onset of an economic recession in late  compounding edsels problems was the fact that the car had to compete with wellestablished nameplates from the big three such as pontiac oldsmobile buick dodge and desoto as well as with its own internal sister division mercury which itself had never been a stellar sales success to make matters still worse as a new make edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers as its competing makes had even if the – recession had not occurred the edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace in the early s when the e car was in its earliest stages of development ford executive vice president ernest r breech had convinced ford management that the mediumpriced market segment offered great untapped opportunity at the time breechs assessment was basically correct in  pontiac buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units but by the fall of  when the edsel was introduced the market had changed drastically independent manufacturers in the mediumpriced field were drifting toward insolvency hoping to reverse its losses packard acquired studebaker which was also in financial difficulty the board decided to stop production under the venerable packard badge after  the – packards were little more than studebakers badged as packards attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its premerger brands nash and hudson after the  model year sales of chryslers desoto marque dropped dramatically from its  high by over  in  when desoto sales failed to rebound during the  model year plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by  indeed sales for most car manufacturers even those not introducing new models were down among domestic makes only rambler and lincoln produced more cars in  than in  customers started buying more fuelefficient automobiles particularly volkswagen beetles which were selling at rates exceeding  a year in the us from  onward edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration but they also required premium fuel and their fuel economy especially in city driving was poor even by lates standards ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury by  buyers had become fascinated with economy cars and a large car like the edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own when ford introduced the falcon in  it sold over  units in its first year fords investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the edsel helped make the companys subsequent success with the falcon possible by  the market for mediumpriced cars had recovered and this time ford had the right car the galaxie  ltd the ltds success led chevrolet to introduce the caprice as a mid upscale trim option on its topoftheline impala fourdoor hardtop edsel a difficult name to placeedit the name of the car edsel is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity naming the vehicle after edsel ford was proposed early in its development however the ford family strongly opposed its use henry ford ii declared that he did not want his fathers good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps ford also ran internal studies to decide on a name and even dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas they reached no conclusions ford retained the advertising firm foote cone  belding to come up with a name when the agency issued its report citing over  possibilities fords ernest breech commented that they had been hired to develop one name not  early favorites for the name brand included citation corsair pacer and ranger which were ultimately chosen for the vehicles series names david wallace manager of marketing research and coworker bob young unofficially invited freethinker poet marianne moore for input and suggestions moores unorthodox contributions among them utopian turtletop pastelogram turcotinga resilient bullet andante con moto and mongoose civique were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature by the instruction of ernest breech who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of henry ford ii the car was finally called edsel in honor of edsel ford former company president and son of henry ford reliabilityedit even though the edsel shared its basic technology with other ford products a number of issues caused reliability problems mostly with the  models reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other ford models ford never dedicated a standalone factory solely to edsel model production the firstyear  edsels were assembled in both mercury and ford factories the longerwheelbase models citation and corsair were produced alongside the mercury products while the shorterwheelbase models pacer and ranger were produced alongside the ford products workers assembling fords and mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional edsel that moved down the line burdensome because it required them to change tools and parts bins then switch back to resume assembling fords or mercurys after completing assembly on the edsel the workers were also expected to accommodate edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of ford and mercury production consequently the desired quality control of the different edsel models proved difficult to achieve even when the fords and mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines many edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics some of whom never installed the additional parts at all some dealers did not even receive all the parts in the march  issue of popular mechanics  of edsel owners reported poor workmanship with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure in its test car popular mechanics tested for these problems and noted others such as the trunk leaking badly in a storm and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled design controversiesedit the distinctive center grille of the  edsel the edsels most memorable design feature was its trademark horsecollar or toilet seat grille which was quite distinct from other cars of the period according to a popular joke at the time the edsel resembled an oldsmobile sucking a lemon while automotive critic neil dan cites the grilles vaginal appearance the edsels frontend ensemble as it eventually appeared bore little resemblance if any to the original concept roy brown the original chief designer on the edsel project had envisioned a slender almost delicate opening in the center engineers fearing engine cooling problems vetoed the intended design which led to the nowinfamous horsecollar the vertical grille theme while improved for the  models was discontinued for the  models which were similar to ford models of the same year although coincidentally the new frontend design was very similar to that of the  pontiac the teletouch pushbutton automatic transmission selector was an extremely complex feature it proved problematic in part because the steering wheel hub where the pushbuttons were located was the traditional location of the horn button some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn while the edsel was fast the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing there were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons d for drag l for leap and r for race instead of drive low and reverse the control wires for teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and in some cases complete failure the electrical design required drivers to shift from park to reverse to neutral to drive in that order to avoid overloading the teletouch motor the motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of park while on a hill so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the park button complaints also surfaced about the taillights on model edsel station wagons the lenses were boomerangshaped and placed in a reverse fashion at a distance they appeared as arrows pointed in the opposite direction of the turn being made when the left turn signal flashed its arrow shape pointed right and vice versa however there was little that could be done to give the fordbased station wagons a unique appearance from the rear because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed only the taillights and trim could be touched there was room for separate turn signals in addition to the boomerangs but the us industry had never supplied them up to that point and they were probably never seriously considered mechanics of the time were wary of the cubicinch edsel e engine because its perfectly flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers the heads were set at an angle with roof pistons forming both a squish zone on one side and a combustion chamber on the other combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore this design was similar to chevrolets cubicinch w engine which was also introduced in  while the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics company politics and the role of robert mcnamaraedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september  learn how and when to remove this template message an intriguing aspect of the edsel story is that it provides a case study in how company politics can kill an idea while the car and ford’s planning of the car are the most often cited reasons for its failure internal ford motor company memoranda indicate that the edsel may actually have been a victim of dissension within fords management ranks following world war ii henry ford ii retained robert mcnamara as one of the whiz kids to help turn ford around mcnamara’s costcutting and costcontainment skills helped ford emerge from its nearcollapse after the war as a result mcnamara eventually amassed a considerable amount of power at ford mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that like the elder ford mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the companys other products thus mcnamara had little use for the continental lincoln mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company mcnamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for continental lincoln mercury and edsel cars and moved to consolidate lincoln mercury and edsel into the mel division mcnamara saw to it that the continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the lincoln range for  he next set his sights on edsel by maneuvering for elimination of the dual wheelbases and separate bodies used in  instead the edsel would share the ford platform and use ford’s inner body structure for  in  the edsel emerged as little more than a ford with different trim mcnamara also moved to reduce edsel’s advertising budget for  and for  he virtually eliminated it the final blow came in the fall of  when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of fords management that the edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before the edsel bled the company dry mcnamara also attempted to discontinue the lincoln nameplate but that effort ended with elwood engels now classic redesign of  mcnamara left ford when he was named secretary of defense by president john f kennedy during the  presidential election republican nominee barry goldwater blamed mcnamara then secretary of defense for the edsels failure eventually fords former executive vice president ernest r breech who was a financial contributor to goldwater wrote to the senators campaign explaining that mr mcnamara… had nothing to do with the plans for the edsel car or any part of the program however the charge continued to be leveled against mcnamara for years during his time as head of the world bank mcnamara instructed his public affairs officer to distribute copies of breechs letter to the press whenever the accusation was made the edsel cometedit the scheduled  edsel comet compact car was hastily rebranded as the comet and assigned to lincolnmercury dealerships as a standalone product based on the newfor ford falcon the comet was an instant success selling more cars in its first year than all models of edsel produced during that marques entire threeyear run styling touches seen in the comets sold to the public that allude to being part of the edsel family of models included the instrument cluster rear tailfins though canted diagonally and the taillight shape the lens is visually similar to that used on the  edsel and even retained the embossed e part code the comets keys were even shaped like edsel keys with the center bar removed from the e to form a c for  ford officially assigned the comet to the mercury brand the mercury name does not appear anywhere on the  and  models todayedit more than half a century after its spectacular failure the edsel has become a highly collectible

many other car manufacturers such as pontiac jaguar bmw subaru lancia alfa romeo and saab have employed similar vertical grilles successfully in their car designs many of the edsels features such as selfadjusting brakes gear selection by steering wheel buttons etc which were considered too impractical in the late s are now standard features of sports cars plastic scale models of all three edsel years were produced by aluminum metal toys amt in its familiar  scale both promotional and kit versions were sold these command premium prices today especially the rare  and  models the  pacer hardtop was reissued as a totally new and much more detailed kit by amt in the s the  hardtop is also available as a resin kit from several resin model producers but is typically priced close to the cost of an original kit yat ming a producer of diecast model cars offered a nicely detailed  citation in  scale in both hardtop and convertible body styles yat ming also produced a detailed  scale diecast of the citation convertible in several color combinations the franklin mint produced highly detailed  scale and  scale diecast models of the  citation convertible the danbury mint produced a  scale
