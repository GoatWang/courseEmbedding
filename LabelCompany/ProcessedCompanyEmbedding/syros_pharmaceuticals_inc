syros pharmaceuticals inc syrs anneovarian cancer survivor an expression makes a world of difference at syros we are pioneering a new area of medicine focused on controlling the expression of genes the genes expressed  turned on off up or down  in any given cell determine its type and function by creating medicines to control the expression of genes that have gone awry in disease we aim to make a profound difference in the lives of patients and their families join us in understanding the coordinated expression of the syros team in fulfilling our mission get to know us we understand how the expression of genes is controlled regulatory regions of the genome control the expression of genes turning them on off up or down like genomic dimmer switches and determining how a cell behaves whether it is a skin cell or a lung cell whether it is normal or diseased because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells alterations in these regulatory regions contribute to virtually all diseases but until recently scientists lacked the tools to study these regulatory regions rendering them poorly understood and largely unexploited for drug discovery and development we have built the first platform dedicated to the regulatory genome to systematically and efficiently identify diseasecausing alterations in gene expression and develop medicines that control the expression of genes with the aim of providing a profound and durable benefit for patients with diseases that have largely eluded other genomicsbased approaches learn about our gene control platform

risk factors section of this prospectus before deciding to invest in our common stock overview         we are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering an understanding of the noncoding regulatory region of the genome controlling the activation and repression of genes our goal is to advance a new wave of medicines to control the expression of diseasedriving genes we have built a proprietary gene control platform designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of dna in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across therapeutic areas and a range of diseases by focusing on genomically defined subsets of patients we believe we can conduct efficient clinical trials with a higher likelihood of success we are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and immunemediated diseases and are building a pipeline of gene control medicines         in september  we began enrolling patients in a phase  clinical trial for our lead product candidate sy tamibarotene an oral potent and selective retinoic acid receptor alpha or rar a  agonist in genomically defined subsets of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or aml and relapsed highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome or mds in the fourth quarter of  an investigational device exemption for the assay being used to select patients for this trial was approved by the us food and drug administration with this approval we have expanded this trial to include newly diagnosed aml patients who are at least  years old and are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy and lowerrisk transfusiondependent mds patients during  we further expanded this trial to explore the safety and efficacy of sy when combined with azacitidine a hypomethylating agent that is commonly used to treat aml in newly diagnosed aml patients who are at least  years old and not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy on the basis of preclinical data we have generated we also plan to pursue clinical development of sy in combination with a therapeutic anticd antibody in defined subsets of aml and mds patients identified using our biomarkers in may  we initiated a phase  clinical trial for our development candidate sy a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of cyclindependent kinase  or cdk in patients with advanced solid tumors both of these programs may have potential in additional disease indications using our platform we are also generating a pipeline of novel preclinical drug candidates in cancer including immunooncology and advancing our research efforts in autoimmune and rare genetic diseases we plan to advance one of our four preclinical programs to support a potential

new area of medicine focused on controlling the expression of genes the genes expressed  turned on off up or down  in any given cell determine its type and function by creating medicines to control

team in fulfilling our mission get to know us we understand how the expression of genes is controlled regulatory regions of the genome control the expression of genes turning them on off up or down like genomic dimmer switches and determining how a cell behaves whether it is a skin cell or a lung cell whether it is normal or diseased because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells alterations in these regulatory regions contribute to virtually all diseases but until recently scientists lacked the tools to study these regulatory regions rendering them poorly understood and largely unexploited for drug discovery and development we have built the first platform dedicated to the regulatory genome to systematically and efficiently identify diseasecausing alterations in gene expression and develop medicines that control the expression of genes with the aim of providing a profound and durable benefit for patients with diseases that have largely eluded other genomicsbased

our indenabling activities and the phase  portion of our planned phase  clinical trial for sy including clinical research outsourcing drug manufacturing and internal personnel costs • approximately  million for new and ongoing research activities including for our preclinical programs and our platform with a goal of systematically delivering additional inds and • the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes this expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development and commercialization efforts the status of and results from clinical trials any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents we have no current agreements commitments or understandings for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products businesses or technologies based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to reach clinical activity data readouts for sy in aml and mds and sy in acute leukemias and to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through mid we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect we do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development of any of our product candidates pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing instruments and us government securities the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products while we believe that our technology development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future we compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical biotechnology and other related markets that address gene control and cancer there are other companies working to develop therapies in the fields of gene control and cancer these companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes the most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery radiation and drug therapy including chemotherapy hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy there are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer in many cases these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy while our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies they may also be used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection and others are available on a generic basis many of these approved drugs are wellestablished therapies and are widely accepted by physicians patients and thirdparty payors in general although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events as a result the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high in addition to currently marketed therapies there are also a number of medicines in late stage clinical development to treat cancer these medicines in development may provide efficacy safety convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies as a result they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates if approved are likely to be their efficacy safety convenience price the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market in addition our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other thirdparty payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines there are many generic medicines currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing and additional medicines are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years if our therapeutic product candidates are approved we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic medicines if the drug candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs currently in development sy we plan to initially develop sy our rar† agonist for patients with aml or mds we will select patients for our clinical trials based on highlevels of rar† as measured by our proprietary biomarker there has been little advancement in treatment options for patients with these cancers typical treatment includes chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation sy may face competition from other drug candidates currently in clinical development for relapsed or refractory aml and mds several companies are developing drugs for aml including daiichi sankyo company limited boehringer ingelheim gmbh agios pharmaceuticals inc novartis ag astellas pharma inc and karyopharm therapeutics inc we believe that sy will be the only selective rar† agonist in clinical development for relapsed or refractory aml in north america and europe because the mechanism of action is different than the others currently on the market and in development we believe that sy could be firstinclass and could be used in combination with other therapies which could minimize competition assuming that data from a registrationenabling trial warrants such use we are aware of only one other selective rar† program being pursued by io therapeutics inc this program appears to be in clinical development sy we plan to initially develop sy our cdk inhibitor for patients with relapsed or refractory aml or recurrent or refractory all the competitive landscape for aml is described above in all patients are typically treated with older chemotherapeutics targeted therapies such as kinase inhibitors including imatinib and dasatinib and monoclonal antibodies including rituximab and blinatumamab have been developed and used successfully for certain patient populations within all if sy receives marketing approval it may face competition from other drug candidates currently in development for relapsed and refractory all from several companies including amgen inc novartis and juno therapeutics inc we believe that sy will be the only selective mechanism of its kind in clinical development because the mechanism of action is different than the others currently on the market and in development we believe that it could be firstinclass and used in combination with other therapies which could minimize competition assuming that data from a registrationenabling trial warrants such use we are aware of two other selective cdk inhibitor programs both of which appear to be in early preclinical development company description we are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering an understanding of the region of the genome controlling the activation and repression of genes our goal is to advance a new wave of medicines to control the expression of diseasedriving genes we have built a proprietary gene control platform designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of dna in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across therapeutic areas and a range of diseases by focusing on genomically defined subsets of patients we believe we can conduct efficient clinical trials with a higher likelihood of success we are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and immunemediated diseases and are building a pipeline of gene control medicines we plan to begin a phase  clinical trial for our lead product candidate sy tamibarotene in mid this trial will enroll genomically defined subsets of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or aml and relapsed highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome or mds we plan to initiate a phase  clinical trial for our development candidate sy initially for the treatment of acute leukemia in the first half of  both of these programs may have potential in additional indications using our platform we are also generating a pipeline of novel preclinical drug candidates for genomically defined subsets of currently underserved patients our goal is to build a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company based on our leadership position in gene control there are approximately  different cell types in the human body despite having identical genomes each of these cell types has a different function for example a skin cell functions differently from a muscle cell despite sharing the exact same dna what determines a cells type and function is the specific set of genes that is expressed or turned on or off in that particular cell this coordinated activation and repression of genes known as the cells gene expression program is controlled by noncoding regions of the genome alterations in these noncoding regions change a cells gene expression program altering its normal function and leading to disease because this biology is fundamental to the function of all cells it applies across diseases whether the cause is genetic environmental bacterial viral or multifactorial although researchers have long believed that alterations in noncoding regions of dna which account for  of the genome play a key role in driving disease the scientific community has lacked the tools to study these regions of the genome rendering them poorly understood as a result the discovery and development of targeted therapies to date has focused almost exclusively on abnormal proteins resulting from genetic alterations found in regions of dna that encode for proteins which represent less than  of the entire genome while targeted therapies in which the right drug is matched to the right patient have dramatically improved the ability to treat certain cancers and other serious diseases the identification of new drug targets by sequencing coding regions of dna has been largely exhausted moreover in cancer inhibiting abnormal proteins resulting from single genetic alterations can often lead to drug resistance and limited durable clinical benefit furthermore many serious diseases continue to go unaddressed due to the limitations of current drug discovery approaches taken together these factors underscore the need for fundamentally new approaches to drug discovery and development based on the work of our scientific founders we believe we have developed the first proprietary platform designed to systematically and efficiently analyze noncoding regions of the genome in healthy and diseased cells taken from patient tissues to identify alterations in gene expression programs that represent optimal points of therapeutic intervention and develop drugs to control the expression of diseasedriving genes by doing so we believe our gene control platform will allow us to i identify a wide array of potential new drug targets across a range of diseases ii provide a new lens for diagnosing and segmenting patients including those with complex multifactorial diseases that have eluded segmentation with other genomicbased approaches and iii advance a new wave of medicines that have the potential to influence multiple drivers of disease through a single target making them less susceptible to drug resistance and providing patients with a more profound and durable benefit than many of todays targeted therapies in contrast to therapies that target a single abnormal protein gene control medicines target alterations in the cells underlying gene expression program modulating the coordinated expression of the crucial set of genes that contribute to disease the relatively few gene control medicines available today are among the most important targeted therapies and are widely used for their approved indications these drugs including estrogen receptor inhibitors for breast cancer androgen receptor inhibitors for prostate cancer and glucocorticoids for inflammatory diseases illustrate the significant therapeutic potential of gene control medicines however the poor understanding of noncoding regions of dna has historically prevented a systematic approach to identifying these critical points of therapeutic intervention making gene control a largely untapped field for targeted drug discovery and development we believe that we have created a systematic and efficient approach to analyzing noncoding regions of the genome in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations our proprietary gene control platform consists of two fundamental pillars identifying novel gene control targets linked to genomically defined patient populations and drugging gene control targets identifying novel gene control targets starting from human tissue samples we compare diseased cells to normal cells and analyze the cells of different patient subsets within a disease to systematically and efficiently identify alterations in gene expression programs that represent optimal points of therapeutic intervention and associated biomarkers for patient selection we home in on a cells gene expression program by using genomic tools to locate superenhancers which are highly specialized regions of noncoding dna that are central to orchestrating gene expression programs and drive the increased expression of the genes crucial to the function of a given cell analysis of superenhancers and their associated genes provides critical insights into changes in gene expression programs that contribute to disease we have invested significant resources in our tissue processing genomics and computational biology capabilities to industrialize the analysis of gene expression programs to reveal the genes crucial to cell type and function in diseased cells we have amassed one of the largest known datasets of gene expression programs across a wide range of human diseases and cell types and have validated multiple novel disease targets and biomarkers to date we have analyzed or are in the process of analyzing gene expression programs in aml breast cancer ovarian cancer hepatocellular carcinoma pancreatic cancer renal cell carcinoma nondisease and lupus immune cells polycystic kidney disease spinal muscular atrophy and alzheimers disease through those efforts we have identified approximately  novel drug targets in oncology immunooncology and autoimmune diseases and validated seven of those targets using biological methods to knock out the target gene or chemical methods to modulate the targets activity the discovery and validation of these targets has led to the identification of our product candidate sy as well as additional novel preclinical drug candidates in earlier stages of research and development we plan to analyze gene expression programs in several other cancers including colorectal lung and melanoma as well as several other diseases and cell types including additional inflammatory disorders and immune cells from tumors our longterm goal is to analyze gene expression programs in serious diseases where we believe currently underserved patients can benefit from gene control medicines drugging gene control targets our platform is designed to identify drug targets across a broad range of therapeutic areas and therapeutic modalities we focus our internal drug discovery efforts on small molecule chemistry to target specialized proteins responsible for gene expression including transcription factors transcriptional kinases and other transcriptional and regulatory proteins for several reasons first because these specialized proteins play a central role in implementing gene expression programs they are among the most promising and highpotential gene control targets for therapeutic intervention transcription factors bind directly to dna sequences to control the transcription of genetic information from dna transcription factors perform this function with other transcriptional and regulatory proteins including transcriptional kinases second transcriptional and regulatory proteins have historically been difficult to drug and represent an opportunity to bring novel and differentiated therapies to patients third we have built a differentiated combination of expertise tools and capabilities that we believe will give us cuttingedge insights into drugging transcriptional and regulatory proteins through significant investments in developing our capabilities in biochemistry structural biology and medicinal chemistry and in developing a sophisticated suite of proprietary assays which are internally developed tests that we use to measure the biochemical biophysical cellular and genomic activity of known and novel compounds against gene control targets we believe we will be able to overcome challenges that have prevented others from systematically and successfully developing gene control medicines we are building a pipeline of product candidates to modulate gene expression programs through two distinct approaches internal efforts to discover novel drugs against our validated gene control targets and externally focused efforts to link existing drugs to novel genomically defined patient populations identified through our platform these externally focused efforts could enable us to identify drugs that we may seek to inlicense or acquire or use as starting points for our own drug discovery and development programs to accelerate our development path we are leveraging our platform to develop a pipeline of gene control product candidates by focusing on genomically defined subsets of patients who are most likely to respond we believe we will conduct efficient clinical trials and rapidly achieve clinical proofofconcept with positive clinical results in areas of unmet medical need we intend to apply for breakthrough therapy designation and fast track designation which if granted could accelerate our clinical development path our most advanced drug programs are summarized in the table below syros initial planned potential commercial program indications milestones indications rights sy rar† aml and mds • • north agonist initiate phase  breast cancer america clinical trial • europe in acute promyelocytic mid leukemia apl • expect initial data readout in mid sy cdk acute leukemia • • worldwide inhibitor initiate small cell lung phase  cancer clinical trial • in triple negative h  breast cancer • • expect initial mycnamplified data readout in neuroblastoma h  sy sy tamibarotene is an oral potent and selective agonist or activator of the transcription factor rar† we leveraged our platform to analyze gene expression programs in primary aml and breast cancer patient tumor cells and discovered that rara the gene that codes for rar† was associated with a superenhancer in some patients tumors but not in others we also identified a proprietary biomarker which we refer to as the rara biomarker related to the superenhancer associated with rara the superenhancer associated with rara is believed to lock cells in an immature proliferative and undifferentiated state treatment with sy in cancer cells with the superenhancer associated with rara appears to promote differentiation of these cells we are initially advancing sy into novel genomically defined patient populations with aml and mds we chose these initial indications due to high levels of observed efficacy of sy in our preclinical models the significant unmet medical need of these patients and the potential for accelerated development we intend to pursue additional indications including breast cancer in the near future we plan to use our rara biomarker for patient selection we have the exclusive north american and european commercial rights to the existing preclinical data for sy in all human cancers under our license agreement with tmrc co ltd sy is approved as tamibarotene in japan for the treatment of apl a form of aml for which the drug has a wellcharacterized efficacy and safety profile we intend to explore the development of sy for the treatment of apl in north america and europe our preclinical data we have conducted multiple preclinical studies of sy in aml and breast cancer in a mouse model implanted with human aml cells with the rara biomarker known as a rara biomarkerpositive patientderived xenograft or pdx model sy was observed to have significant antitumor activity and prolonged survival in treated animals relative to untreated animals in contrast in a pdx model with human aml cells without the rara biomarker sy was not observed to have an effect on tumor control or survival these data demonstrate a strong link between the rara biomarker and response to treatment with sy and provide meaningful evidence that patients with the rara biomarker will be promising candidates for treatment with sy sy clinical development plan we plan to initiate a phase  clinical trial in mid that will enroll genomically defined subsets of patients with relapsed or refractory aml or relapsed highrisk mds in may  the us food and drug administration or fda accepted our investigational new drug or ind application for this trial we plan to select patients for this trial using the rara biomarker we believe patients whose tumors have this biomarker will be more likely to experience a profound and durable clinical benefit from treatment with sy we expect to have initial data from this study in mid or  months after the first patient is enrolled we also plan to evaluate sy in newly diagnosed aml patients  years of age or older who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy and lowrisk transfusiondependent mds patients in order to prospectively select patients in these populations using our rara biomarker we will seek clearance for the use of the biomarker test from the fda through the investigational device exemption process sy sy is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of the transcriptional kinase known as cyclindependent kinase  or cdk we are investigating sy for the treatment of cancers that are dependent on a high and constant expression of certain transcription factors for their growth and survival a phenomenon known as transcriptional addiction cdk is a transcriptional kinase that is associated with superenhancers controlling the expression of the transcription factors driving these cancers growth and survival inhibiting cdk preferentially lowers the expression of diseasedriving genes controlled by superenhancers including oncogenic transcription factors myb and myc and results in the selective killing of cancer cells over noncancerous cells preclinical studies of our cdk inhibitors demonstrated that transcriptionally addicted cancers are particularly sensitive to selective inhibition of cdk including aml tall a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or all mycnamplified neuroblastoma small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer our preclinical data sy has shown promising efficacy and safety in our in vivo and in vitro preclinical studies in terms of efficacy sy was observed to have complete responses and survival benefit in cellderived xenograft or cdx and pdx models of aml in one such study mice treated with sy experienced initial clearance of the disease and maintained residual low levels of human leukemia cells in fact  of treated mice remained alive and levels of human leukemia cells in the blood remained at less than  beyond the dosing period by contrast in untreated mice the cancer progressed reaching levels of human leukemia cells of greater than  in blood and greater than  in tissues in terms of selectivity and safety in cell lines sy was observed to preferentially kill cancer cells by inducing robust sustained and dosedependent apoptosis of aml cells with minimal impact on noncancerous cells in addition sy was observed to have markedly fewer negative effects on healthy cells than a pancdk inhibitor pancdk inhibitors have been observed to result in blood cell death or myelosuppression sy clinical development plan we have begun indenabling activities for sy and our goal is to initiate a phase  clinical trial in patients with acute leukemia including aml and all in the first half of  we expect to have initial data from this study in the first half of  we believe there is a welldefined path to clinical proofofconcept in acute leukemia we then plan to expand into a broader set of cancers using our platform to identify patient subsets with transcriptionally addicted cancers such as small cell lung cancer triple negative breast cancer and mycnamplified neuroblastoma we continue to explore the potential of cdk inhibition in additional cancers we are using our platform to analyze gene expression programs across additional cancers
