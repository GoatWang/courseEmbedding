the experts dont understand and much like the recent events that took place at jp morgan sometimes complicated investments produce unexpected results many of the more complicated investment products are likely inappropriate for retail or parttime investors but that doesnt mean that stocks and mutual funds are all that are available to you have you considered closedend funds see open your eyes to closedend funds openend fundsmany investment products are not one single product but are instead a collection of individual products just as you wear a collection of clothing products to make up your whole wardrobe products like mutual funds and etfs do the same thing by investing in a collection of stocks and bonds to comprise the entire look there are two types of these products on the market openend funds are what you know as a mutual fund they dont have a limit as to how many shares they can issue when an investor purchases shares in a mutual fund more shares are created and when somebody sells his or her shares the shares are taken out of circulation if a large amount of shares are sold called a redemption the fund may have to sell some of its investments in order to pay the investor you cant watch an openend fund like you watch your stocks because they dont trade on the open market at the end of each trading day the funds reprice based on the amount of shares bought and sold their price is based on the total value of the fund or the net asset value nav see when to sell a mutual fund closedend fundsclosedend funds look similar but theyre very different a closedend fund functions much more like an exchange traded fund than a mutual fund they are launched through an ipo in order to raise money and then trade in the open market just like a stock or an etf they only issue a set amount of shares and although their value is also based on the nav the actual price of the fund is affected by supply and demand allowing it to trade at prices above or below its real value there are currently about 0 closedend funds trading on the market yet they are not well known by retail investors some funds like blackrock corporate high yield fund vi hyt pay a dividend of more than  making these funds an attractive choice for income investors but investors have to know one key fact about closedend funds nearly 0 of all of these products use leverage as a way to produce more gains using borrowed money to invest may produce big returns but it could also put the fund under intense pressure recently moodys downgraded the rating of many of the largest banks that included debt securities issued by  closedend funds these downgrades will likely make it more expensive for these and other closedend funds to borrow money in order to invest higher borrowing costs impact the return investors receive from these funds making them potentially less attractive in the future see leveraged etfs are they right for you the bottom lineopenend products may represent a safer choice than closedend funds but the closedend products might produce a better return combining both dividend payments and capital appreciation of course investors should always compare individual products
