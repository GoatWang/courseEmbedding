charges there are situations however where a commissionbased platform is simply more appropriate at the onset of each client relationship we have an open discussion about the expected total expenses of either platform and together determine which would be the better option things we discuss include whether it would be better to pay separately for each trade executed and each product and service used since these factors may change we periodically reevaluate whether the ongoing use of a particular assetbased fee program continues to be appropriate for each clients’ needs freedom by delegating
