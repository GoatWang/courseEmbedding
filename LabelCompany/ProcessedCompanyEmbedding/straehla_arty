conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on mammoth energy services’ website i would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference mr don crist mammoth energy services director of investor relations sir you may begin don crist good morning and welcome to mammoth energy services first quarter  earnings conference call joining me on today’s call is arty straehla chief executive officer and mark layton chief financial officer before i turn the call over to them i would like to read our safe harbor statement some of our comments today may include forwardlooking statements reflecting mammoth energy services’ views about future events these matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forwardlooking statements these risks are discussed in mammoth energy services’ form k recent current reports on form k and other securities and change commission filings we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason our comments today may also include nongaap financial measures additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included in our firstquarter press release which can be found on our website along with our firstquarter earnings presentation now i would like to turn the call over to arty arty straehla thank you don and good morning everyone if you turn to page  of our earnings presentation i would like to walk you through some of the highlights of the first quarter of  the first quarter of  was another strong one for mammoth as we staffed our third fleet in the northeast and restarted our muskie sand facility financially we generated revenues of  million a net loss of  million and adjusted ebitda of  million resulting in an ebitda margin of  which was ahead of analyst expectations the first quarter was a busy one for mammoth in late march we announced several pending acquisitions including taylor frac stingray energy services stingray cementing which are owned by wexford gulfport and rhino resources in exchange for  million shares of stock in addition we announced the pending acquisition of the assets of chieftain sand which we plan to rename piranha for  million combined these transactions will broaden our service offering in the northeast as well as significantly backward integrate our completion business once the expansion of taylor is complete later this year mammoth is expecting to have processing capacity of nearly  million tons of sand per year which by our estimation will be roughly double our needs once all six of our pressure pumping fleets are operating in addition the acquisition of piranha is strategic as it is located on the union pacific railway with unit train access which will provide us a complementary low cost solution to move sand into the mid continent and texas markets with that i would like to turn the call over to mark layton to cover our financial performance before walking you through the performance of our individual divisions mark layton thank you arty i hope that all of you have had a chance to read our press release so i will keep my financial comments brief and focus on certain highlights we feel are important as you can see on slide  mammoth had a strong first quarter of  with revenues coming in at  million up more than  from the prior year quarter a mix of higher industry activity levels some improved equipment utilization and pricing for our services largely contributed to the higher revenue compared to the prior year quarter operating loss for the first quarter of  was  million which is an improvement of more than  when compared to the operating loss in the first quarter of the prior year of  million on a pershare basis the operating loss came in at  during the first quarter of  as compared to a loss per share of  in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  came in at  million up significantly from ebitda in the prior year loss of  million our adjusted ebitda margin remains strong in the first quarter coming in at  as we discussed on our first on our fourthquarter and fullyear conference call startup costs related to the staffing of our third fleet and expansion into the midcontinent we are expected to compress our margins slightly during the first quarter we expect this compression to be shortlived and remain confident that our corporate ebitda margins will return to the  to  range once all of our equipment currently on order begins working selling general and administrative expenses came in at  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in  the increase resulted primarily from higher professional fees related to the pending acquisitions and total employment costs due to higher activity levels sga expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased  in the first quarter of  compared to  during the first quarter of  if you return to slide  we highlight capex for both the first quarter of  and budgeted capex for the full year we spent  billion during the first quarter of  the majority of which was for equipment related to the november order of  horsepower and associated equipment to date we have taken delivery of  frac bumps and ancillary equipment required for our fourth fleet we expect to receive the blenders and missiles in midmay which will allow for an early june startup the associated equipment for the fifth fleet is expected to arrive in july allowing for an august startup of that fleet we continue to expect total capex to be approximately  million in  this includes  million allocated for the expansion of taylor frac to  million tons per annum up from  tons today as well as the acquisition of three highpressure frac fleets transloads and sand trailers in both the permian and scoopstack as well as selective upgrades to our rig fleet we feel that we can fund this capex program and the  million piranha transaction through cash flows from operations and cash on hand with only modest draws on our revolver which as of march  was undrawn in a current borrowing base of  million in addition our borrowing base is expected to grow once we close the pending acquisitions and our fourth fifth and sixth fleets begin operating as arty stated earlier we continue to see strong demand for our pressure pumping fleets across several markets and expect our fourth fleet to begin working in the scoop on june  the hiring process for the fourth fleet was started a couple of weeks ago and we expect to be fully staffed by midmay we get a lot of questions on the current state of the labor market and can report that we are not having difficulties in finding experienced people today we fully expect the labor market to get progressively tighter as activity picks up across the industry with that i will turn it back over to arty to provide comments on each of our operating segments arty straehla thank you mark moving to slide  you will see a snapshot of stingray pressure pumping our expansion into the scoopstack has begun with the yard and transload secured and as mark stated earlier a majority of the equipment ordered in november is now in our possession we anticipate our fourth fleet to be fully operational and begin its first job on june  with a fifth fleet expected to begin operations in august the sixth fleet remains on track for a q startup likely in october our frac calendar in the utica and midcontinent is fully booked into the fourth quarter while our first job will be with gulfport in the scoop we have plans to work for several operators in the area and intend to operate these fleets in the spot market for the next several months discussions have begun with several operators on longerterm agreements for  so far in  the industry has added  land rigs which in our opinion has created the need for an additional  high pressure pumping fleets or roughly  million horsepower in total we believe current industry demand is roughly  million to  million horsepower based on the current land rig and growing when you compare this to the current estimated working capacity of roughly  million you can see why we and our peers believe pricing continues to see upward pressure some industry analysts are projecting a rig count of between  to  rigs operated by the end of  this would equate to the need for up to  million horsepower by late  if this comes to bear there could be a significant shortage of horsepower in the market while these are just estimates the inbound calls and discussions we are having with our customers leads us to believe that there remains a shortage of horsepower in the industry despite the recent reactivations one other dynamic that is occurring today is the shift to higher sand concentrations and the pump times required to place the sand in the wellbore the majority of current jobs require roughly  pounds of sand per stage up from an average of approximately  pounds per stage in  this shift has required us to increase our average pump time to approximately  hours which is up from approximately  hours during  the increase in pump time is in effect creating additional demand for horsepower as the intensity of completions continues to rise given where we see the current frac market and the effect of the shift to higher sand concentrations we see the potential for continued upward pressure on pricing as we move during  and into  current frac pricing is approximately  to  above the lows experienced in the third quarter of  and targets ebitda margins in the mid to high  range moving to slide  we give you a snapshot of our sand division the acquisitions of taylor frac and piranha will be transformational events for mammoth these acquisitions are strategic as they will add sand reserves to the mammoth portfolio and provide direct support to our pressure pumping fleets once they are completed we will not only be able to fully supply the needs of our six highpressure fleets but we will also have roughly  million tons of sand available to be sold into the spot market once the taylor expansion is completed and piranha is fully operational starting with taylor we are working through the closing process with the expectations of closing the transaction in late q the capacity expansion of the plant to  million tons per year has begun and is expected to be completed by yearend given that we have been managing the business for several years now the transfer of operator is expected to be seamless moving to piranha this asset acquisition will give us access to the union pacific railway with unit train capabilities on site this will allow for a low cost solution to transport sand into the mid continent and texas markets in direct support of our pressure pumping expansion in the area we are actively working towards closing this transaction in the next  to  days once closed we will begin the process for restarting both the wet and dry plants over the coming months the piranha facility has been shuttered for approximately six months and it will take some time to restart the operations and begin selling sand as you can see in the top right graph we expect minimum volumes to be sold from the piranha plant in the back half of  with a steady ramp up to full capacity throughout  the demand for sand especially  remains strong with our volumes completely sold out for the next  days as you can see from the charts on the lower portion of the page we delivered approximately  tons of sand during the first quarter of  through muskie of which  was sold to gulfport the average sales price for the sand sold during the first quarter was  per ton up roughly  quarter over quarter and up more than  from the lows set in q of  current pricing for  is approximately  to  per ton due to increased sand prices the arbitrage we exploited through  by brokering sand has narrowed considerably with the acquisitions and startup of muskie we feel that the brokering of sand would become much smaller going forward than it was in the past moving on to our contract drilling business on slide  the rig market continues to tighten especially in west texas this is driving rig rates for all rigs higher as can be seen by our average day rate rising to  per day in the first quarter which is up  from the lows experienced during the third quarter of  on average we operated four rigs throughout the quarter as we upgraded two of our rigs with walking systems and high pressure fluid ends to make them more competitive in today’s market the volume of inbound calls remains high with five rigs working today and a sixth horizontal rig expected to begin operating in the coming weeks in addition we anticipate putting one of our vertical rigs back to work drilling some salt water disposal wells into next month we will continue to monitor the market and make selectively upgrade  and may selectively upgrade additional rigs in the future if there is demand finally if you turn to slide  let me provide a summation we had a busy first quarter with the announced acquisitions of four separate businesses to further integrate our service offerings the acquisition of both taylor frac and piranha is expected to eliminate a potential bottleneck which some of our competitors are already feeling by internally providing the sand requirements for our own pressure pumping fleets we’ll capture any further appreciations in sand pricing while providing our customers with the peace of mind that their wells will be completed in a timely manner our initial expansion into the scoopstack is nearly complete with the final equipment for our fourth fleet expected to be delivered in the coming weeks and our first frac job scheduled for june  after months of planning we are excited with this expansion and look forward to further existing relationships in the area and establishing new ones i would be remiss if i did not mention our balance sheet at the end of the quarter we had approximately  million of liquidity including  million of cash on hand and a fully undrawn revolver while we expect to dip into our revolver throughout the year to finance our planned expansions we intend to remain conservative and see the potential for significant free cash flow as we move into  the significant increase in the land rig count so far this year has created incremental demand for both pressure pumping and sand we continue to believe that the full effect of the increased drilling activity has not been fully realized with the pressure pumping market which is in our opinion just slightly undersupplied we believe the best indicator for this is frac calendar availability which is booked solid into the fourth quarter with inbound calls for  and work increasing from both existing and new customers in addition the higher sand concentrations per well and longer pump times required to place the sand in the wellbore are causing a shift in pumping requirements and in fact creating additional demand for the existing operating fleets looking forward all these factors should continue to put upward pressure on pricing for the remainder of  and throughout  this concludes our prepared remarks thank you for your time and attention we will now open the call up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes praveen narra of raymond james please go ahead praveen narra so really nice to hear about the work booked into q for your fleets i guess how do we think about how that pricing is negotiated and where you guys stand on the idea of contracts at this point for the pricing which we have seen arty straehla well certainly we have two of our three fleets that are operating today are under contract with gulfport and that continues through september   which gives us very very clear visibility the third fleet is operating and will be totally consumed up in the northeast throughout the rest of this year and we are open to looking at contracts but part of our story has always been that we wanted to be available for the spot market when the spot market passed over the contracted prices and i think this gives us a good opportunity with our additional fleets to play the spot market which we think from the pricing that we’ve seen is continuing to go up praveen narra okay perfect and i guess given what happened to the old markets recently and i know it has happened very recently i guess could you talk about the indications you are getting from customers especially for the scoopstack stuff that on their interest in going forward with activity at these levels or however they are indicating it to you arty straehla we have seen no change praveen on our customers outlooks and their drilling as we talk to customers in the first quarter and customer conversations that we have had as of late many of them are still holding their production or holding their leases with the productions still drilling we see no decline in anybody’s desire to complete wells and look at some contracting of sand since the announcement of our additional sand capacities we have entered into a lot of contractual discussions about taking a large part of that and those discussions continue as late as today with some of our customers so we’ve seen no understand the oil is at  understand the natural gas injections that occurred today and was reported by the ia but at the end of the day we see no change in our customers’ behaviors praveen narra that’s great color thank you very much guys operator our next question comes from jason wangler of wunderlich your line is open jason wangler arty was just curious you mentioned the longer time it’s taking for some of these frac stages and the more sand can you maybe talk about how you see that affecting the equipment in terms of whether you need more horsepower on location and then frankly the useful life of it because it just seems like that could also be a factor as we look out a little bit further down the road arty straehla well jason it’s a very good point it gives you a requirement the intensity of the frac gives you requirement for additional equipment on site i can go back to the fracs that we had several years ago and we have  to  pieces of equipment with the builtin redundancies there today we have  units on there and on some of the fracs and sometimes they require more than that the fracs are much more intense with the longer laterals i saw an article this morning and this is the dj basin but it is pretty indicative of what the eps are doing bill barrett and anadarko both announced that they were going to use higher sand concentrations per lateral foot because the increased well results offset the additional cost of the additional sand and the pumping so we are seeing more and more customers that are doing that and in fact we are seeing the intensity continue to go up to  the old standard was  pounds per lateral foot we are seeing a lot of people move to  to  pounds per lateral foot jason wangler great thanks and then on the drilling side upgrading a couple rigs already could you just kind of give us an idea of your inventory if you will of opportunities to do that with the remaining rigs you have it seems like so far it’s been going very well arty straehla it’s based on customer demand and what people are seeing we’ve seen a lot of upgrades from  psi fluid ins to  we are seeing a lot more in the area of customers desiring walking packages and those type of things so we are doing those things that our customers absolutely are requiring on rigs we spent about  million in q to put capital into it and to increase our efficiencies and increase our rigs we have good line of sight on eight rigs now going to work sometime by july  including some of our verticals our vertical rigs have been on the sidelines we are starting to see some demand for them and some increasing calls to do saltwater disposal wells out in the permian jason wangler okay great thank you very much i will turn it back operator our next question comes from daniel burke of johnson rice your question please daniel burke i was wondering if you guys could help me with one that is a bit more specific on the proppant side just kind of looking ahead here to q and as you all highlighted we will see a mix shift in terms of broker volumes going down and muskie volumes rising i would imagine it is my impression muskie volumes carry a bit more margin for you guys but can you help me maybe better understand how to think about the progression of the proppant business in the shortterm here just into q arty straehla well we are still seeing increased pricing we are seeing pricing today and we are sold out for the next  days on all of our  and we are seeing pricing go to about  a ton on  and pricing is pretty firm on the other grades as well so we are seeing it  we are seeing the effects of the longer laterals and in fleet increased sand and you are right we are not going to be brokering as much sand in  going forward as we continue to grow daniel burke okay and remind me what is your  yield at or coming through muskie what is your percent of sales that are in the  range mark layton the percentage of sales is about  daniel daniel burke high volume mark layton yes the yield out of the cut at muskie is low to mid s  daniel burke okay helpful and then maybe as a followup  the second one a little more broad based but anything you can share since that auction process has been concluded in terms of any refined thoughts on costs to getting the facility back reactivated and performing the way you would like it to and maybe as a related question what is the sand sourcing strategy for the scoopstack here in the interim as you ramp up over the next couple of quarters arty straehla i think first to answer your question about piranha we have not taken over operations there as we have not closed that acquisition of those assets yet so it is preliminary to be able to make an assessment on piranha i think your second question was on the  on sourcing sand for the scoopstack we are able to get to the scoopstack from our existing facilities at muskie as well as through the pending taylor acquisition it’s not as cost effective as what we will see once the piranha acquisition is closed but we do have sand supply from our existing facilities and we will be able to get sand in the scoopstack in the interim period mark layton and in addition to that part of the things we look  rushed over a little bit was we have secured transload facilities here in el reno that gives us the opportunity to service both the scoop and the stack pretty efficiently in addition to that we are  we have trailers and sand trailers and trucks that are coming on board where we will have the full logistics questions filled out where we can  we have the solutions for our customers to get it not only to oklahoma but we also get it from the transload to the wellbore daniel burke okay great and then maybe one last quick one just to toss in in terms of the  the couple of upgraded rigs give us a sense for a rate range i would imagine those will be helpful to overall realized rate but can you give us a range for what those two rigs might be deployed at arty straehla those two rigs are in line with what we are seeing some of our other rigs  so midteens is the range at which the rigs are expected to go back to work operator thank you our next question comes from david anderson of barclays your question please david anderson arty in your remarks you had mentioned current frac pricing up about   of the trough then you made a comment about mid to high s ebitda i was wondering  i wasn’t exactly sure what you’re referencing to if that is what your target was or where you think it’s going to but kind of related to that i’m curious about your views on new capacity you painted a pretty bullish picture on overall market fundamentals and how it’s all going to be tightening so are you starting to think about that after fleet six gets out there what we’re going to do here and how do you think about getting back to that ebitda number is there a targeted ebitda that you need in order to make that  i guess to make the decision on seven plus from here arty straehla right now as you say we’ve got the commitment for six and certainly we are always evaluating markets and we are evaluating our customers’ behaviors and our customer demand on whether we will go forward with the next one or when we will go forward with the next one to really put your question in perspective we are quite bullish we think that the full effect of the rig count look the rig count is up to  as of last week and that full has been rising steadily through q and will continue to those wells that have been drilled will continue to be needed to be completed so we think that there is not enough horsepower coming on fast enough to offset what we think we will be able to do so to answer your questions about the ebitda margins when we talk about being up  to  that is off our loads and remember one of the things that we talked about is we never took negative ebitda work during the worst parts of the trough so we are taking you from there now let me one of the things that we always talked about david was that when we were going to be able to go from two fleets to three fleets in the northeast we had all of our equipment in good shape and that is in attribute to our pm programs to having it already we didn’t cannibalize during the downturn so we pretty seamlessly with the exception of labor costs that we brought on we had taken care of our equipment and we were able to bring it up seamlessly to us it did cost us about  to  in the quarter because we brought the crews on to get them trained in our methods and get them trained in our standard operating procedures david anderson as you are thinking and as you’re going through the process of bringing on this new acquired equipment out there can you talk a little bit about the supply chain you are seeing you had already talked about the labor so i’m curious about everything else flow iron and all the other ancillary equipment around that are their leadtimes starting to build out in any of this equipment are you getting kind of concerned about it and also i guess also similarly as you think a little bit further out what about engines and some of the bigger stuff i’m hearing kind of contradicting data points some are saying there is long leadtimes others saying there is not curious your take on that as you evaluate the market arty straehla as we evaluate the market some of the leadtimes for high pressure iron are extending out a little bit on fluid ends there was a bit of a pinch earlier this year where we monitor that supply chain pretty closely with our suppliers we are not seeing any bottlenecks that would prevent us from rolling out the equipment in the timelines that we outlined in the prepared remarks but there are some delays appearing inside of the supply chain specifically as it relates to engines that timeline is extending out i think we made comments previously in regards to the supply of cat engines we monitored that fairly closely prior to our order of  horsepower earlier this year we expect that timeline to continue to extend as more orders are placed david anderson okay thank you and one last quick question i was just going through your slide deck there and i saw the timing of chieftain coming in there i had a startup in early  but maybe i was just being more conservative was there a change there does that get slit up in your numbers there or was it just me being conservative in my model arty straehla i think you have got a fairly conservative model we have been somewhat conservative in our timeline since we have enclosed that transaction and haven’t taken possession of those assets but i think the short answer is you are fairly conservative in your model operator operator instructions our next question comes from john daniel of simmons  company your line is open john daniel just a few quick ones for me first housekeeping i guess you noted you are drilling some saltwater disposal wells is that for service companies or eps arty straehla it’s for eps john daniel okay got it thank you and then a number of companies like yourselves are reporting full frac calendars i’m curious given the tightness now when you book stuff have you taken any type of deposits and just curious if there is any risk that your customers are double booking dates if you will thus potentially leading to a possible overstatement of demand arty straehla traditionally it’s not we have not seen this business where you put down deposits to secure that date and we are not doing that john we haven’t got to that point does that potential lie there yes it could perhaps but we haven’t seen it so far and in the northeast we are very sure that one being pulled through q john daniel okay then just sort of last one obviously you guys have a strong balance sheet and you’ve made some nice tactical tuckins and we are certainly opportunistic on the capital equipment expansion early but you guys have been doing this a long time and we can’t be dismissive of  oil particularly given it’s not clear where we are going from here so just i know with that uncertainty is the appropriate step at this point to maybe dial back further capital expansion plans that you can leverage your balance sheet perhaps make some pretty big or bold strategic moves should oil prices migrate lower arty straehla we monitor the commodities very closely and we are cognizant of the macro we are nimble and able to adjust our capex budget so to your point we will continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet we will continue to be opportunistic with the deployment of capital and we will be nimble in regards to our capex program john daniel okay great just would you say your preference from this point forward would be more towards acquisitions versus organic capex purchases or the opposite arty straehla i will tell you john no our story remains the same it’s an organic growth and look at all acquisition possibilities and when you get the right ones and if the right deals came around on equipment and that type of thing we would certainly look at executing we are very cognizant of where the commodity pricing is and we look at that but we are totally focused on executing we are totally focused on digesting the acquisitions that we’ve just done in q we are meeting every week on our expansion on taylor we are meeting and discussing and as soon as we fund and close chieftain on what our steps are going to be to get there so we are totally focused on execution john daniel okay awesome thanks guys operator thank you at this time i would like to turn the call over to arty straehla for any closing remarks sir arty straehla well thank you certainly appreciate everybody’s time and taking part in certainly the discussions that we’ve had this really concludes the call we will certainly be available to discuss and to talk with the analysts at any point in time one of the things i would just like to  this concludes a busy busy first quarter for us with all the acquisitions that were announced all the things that we are bringing in but we still think strategically we are in the right position and on a go forward basis we moved our sand capacity to  million tons we’re going to need about  million of that to operate for ourselves on what we see right now and we will be taking opportunities to contract out sand as we go forward and to look at it we think there is more upside on our rig site to  as it gets fully deployed and we feel very comfortable with where we are at this point in time and we will  again and i will reiterate what i said to john about the focus on execution and making sure that that stays there we know about  we are watching the commodity prices we are watching a lot of other indicators but we are totally focused on executing with that i will turn it back over to the operator and say goodbye operator thank you
