improve people’s lives iot has accelerated cocreation between companies and has helped create new value but in order to leverage the full potential of iot data processing must go beyond cyberspace new and innovative services in the real world will depend on our ability to combine data with physical operations that’s why robotics will play such a crucial role moving forward as they become our bridge between the real and virtual worlds at hitachi we’ve developed a wide range of robots for various applications by leveraging our expertise in operational technologies ot but we’re not developing technologies without reason we’re implementing social innovation by integrating robots with iot platforms and using that technology in social infrastructures we’re actively promoting initiatives to improve people’s lives humanoid robot emiew and robotics it platform for customer services （short version）  hitachi emiew is a human symbiotic robot that aggregates data obtained from various external sensors information necessary for providing services is then processed over a cloudbased robotics it platform and fed back to the robot – helping it navigate communicate and interact with its surroundingsthis it infrastructure can also be integrated with existing operational systems to provide business intelligence by processing various kinds of relevant information we also offer business solutions with interconnected robots at hitachi we’ve been developing robotics technology for over half a century while focusing on cocreation with clients to generate new value the history of hitachi group’s robotics dates back to the s with our servomanipulator a remote controlled device for nuclear power plant operationssince then hitachi has introduced a wide variety of robots – from mechatronic products such as semiconductor testing equipment and financial devices to robots for extreme environments like nuclear power plants with hitachi’s rd focusing on the development of automatic control and intelligent processing our advanced robotics has served as the vehicle bringing these technologies to lifein  hitachi became one of the first companies to develop a human symbiotic robot rolling out improved functions in phases with new elemental technologies by  hitachi proudly introduced emiew a serviceassistance robot that can talk and work with people we’re also focusing on cocreation with clients to generate new value currently we’re actively setting up new facilities for conducting demonstration experiments with multiple collaborative spaces already in operation to implement highquality prototyping alongside our clients the proliferation of iot in recent years has seen a wide array of information and knowledge stored in cyberspace this shift has also made realworld applications of digital solutions increasingly realistic through robotics as we develop robotics solutions for the age of iot we’ll continue to drive social innovation forward solving today’s challenges for a better future hitachi has developed a wide variety of robotsthat offer new value to customers emiew is a human symbiotic robot that actively communicates with people emiew draws from hitachi’s extensive expertise in robotics and digital solutions to realize a high level of autonomy a cloudbased it infrastructure serves as a “remote brain” which monitors and controls the robot’s body this brain connected with the robot’s body in real time also gives emiew the ability to communicate navigate through its surroundings and provide customer support and guidanceby accurately understanding situations in various service settings emiew is able to recognize and approach those in need it can even start up a conversation on its own to provide services —

pioneering the future of logistics consumer needs are becoming increasingly diversified and logistics is becoming even more complex as a result while these trends are giving rise to a demand for more streamlined warehouse operations current automation equipment can only be used for certain types of products and work which limits their applicationat hitachi we’ve developed an autonomous mobile dual arm robot that opens new opportunities for warehouses equipped with two commercially sold industrial arms this robot comes with an elevating platform mounted on a travelling truck to enable height adjustments it also includes a gripper that automates manual operations such as pulling out shelves and picking out productsthe dual arm robot uses builtin sensors to understand its own position and
