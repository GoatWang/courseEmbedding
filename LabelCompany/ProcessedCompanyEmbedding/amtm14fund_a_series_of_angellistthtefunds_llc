comment below what is form d what it is used for form d disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors the information in form d is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it this is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing this could help competitors entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer why fundraising reporting is good for gentox labs also despite warren stabiler jr’s reporting disadvantages gentox labs llc could benefit from this reporting first it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed the odds are higher that it will stay in the business second this could attract other investors such as venturecapital firms funds and angels third positive pr effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders receive news  ratings via email  enter your
