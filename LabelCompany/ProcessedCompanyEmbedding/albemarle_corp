solutions segmentthe refining solutions segment has two product lines clean fuels technologies which comprises hydroprocessing catalysts hpc and heavy oil upgrading hou which comprises fluidized catalytic cracking fcc catalysts and additives hpc products are applied throughout the refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes fcc catalysts assist in the cracking of less desired refinery petroleum streams into derivative and products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene its fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline its refinery catalysts are used to crack and treat all feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needsthe company competes with fmc corporation sociedad quimica y
