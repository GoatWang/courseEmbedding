minimum wage socialism portal united states portal v t e hartmann is considered to have progressiveliberal politics although he describes himself as part of the radical middle he is the author of numerous books including unequal protection the rise of corporate dominance and the theft of human rights in which he argues that the  us supreme court decision in santa clara county v southern pacific railroad company  us  did not actually grant corporate personhood and that this doctrine derives from a mistaken interpretation of a supreme court clerks notes hartmann considers this a clear contradiction of the intent of the founding fathers of the united states he has also written on the separation of church and state drawing upon the federalist papers to argue that the founding fathers warned against the notion of the united states being a christian nation he contends that the  american election and  american election were stolen through electronic tampering denial of the voting franchise by rigged voting lists and limiting availability of voting machines in selected precincts he also accuses the bush administration of eroding democracy and individual freedoms hartmann is also a vocal critic of the effects of neoliberal globalization on the us economy claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of ronald reagan have led in large part to many american industrial enterprises being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs—once considered a major foundation of the us economy—being relocated to countries in asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the us and the concurrent reversal of the united states traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as china hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the american middle class whose survival hartmann deems critical to the survival of american democracy this argument is expressed in hartmanns  book screwed the undeclared war against the middle class and what we can do about it one of the books main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate medias shifting the american consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class in the book ultimate sacrifice he and coauthor lamar waldron argue that president john f kennedys assassination resulted from a conspiracy by two mafia godfathers carlos marcello and santo trafficante jr who took advantage of a proposed  usasponsored coup against cubas fidel castro to kill the president and then hide their tracks in the resulting coverup of the topsecret coup plans gore vidal in his autobiography point to point navigation devotes much of the final two chapters of his book to praising hartmanns and lamar waldrons scholarship in solving the jfk case jfk was a friend of vidals in a  interview with politico hartmann described his political philosophy as democratic socialism i’ve lived in europe i think that the countries that call themselves democratic socialist—germany france norway sweden denmark finland—have the most functional political and economic system so somebody says what’s your political philosophy i’d say democratic socialism but boy the crap you take when you say socialist because people don’t understand it they think i’m talking about sovietstyle socialism which i’m not personal lifeedit thom has been a vegetarian since he was a teenager attention deficit hyperactivity disorderedit main article hunter vs farmer hypothesis hartmann

progressiveliberal politics although he describes himself as part of the radical middle he is the author of numerous books including unequal protection the rise of corporate dominance and the theft of human rights in which he argues that the  us supreme court decision in santa clara county v southern pacific railroad company  us  did not actually grant corporate personhood and that this doctrine derives from a mistaken interpretation of a supreme court clerks notes hartmann considers this a clear contradiction of the intent of the founding fathers of the united states he has also written on the separation of church and state drawing upon the federalist papers to argue that the founding fathers warned against the notion of the united states being a christian nation he contends that the  american election and  american election were stolen through electronic tampering denial of the voting franchise by rigged voting lists and limiting availability of voting machines in selected precincts he also accuses the bush administration of eroding democracy and individual freedoms hartmann is also a vocal critic of the effects of neoliberal globalization on the us economy claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of ronald reagan have led in large part to many american industrial enterprises being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs—once considered a major foundation of the us economy—being relocated to countries in asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the us and the concurrent reversal of the united states traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as china hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the american middle class whose survival hartmann deems critical to the survival of american democracy this argument is expressed in hartmanns  book screwed the undeclared war against the middle class and what we can do about it one of the books main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate medias shifting the american consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class in the book ultimate sacrifice he and coauthor lamar waldron argue that president john f kennedys assassination resulted from a conspiracy by two mafia godfathers carlos marcello and santo trafficante jr who took advantage of a proposed  usasponsored coup against cubas fidel castro to kill the president and then hide their tracks in the resulting coverup of the topsecret coup plans gore vidal in his autobiography point to point navigation devotes much of the final two chapters of his book to praising hartmanns and lamar waldrons scholarship in solving the jfk case jfk was a friend of vidals in a  interview with politico hartmann described his political philosophy as democratic socialism i’ve lived in europe i think that the countries that call themselves democratic socialist—germany france norway sweden denmark finland—have the most functional political and economic system so somebody says what’s your political philosophy i’d say democratic socialism but boy the crap you take when you say socialist because people don’t understand it they think i’m talking about sovietstyle socialism which i’m not personal lifeedit thom has been a vegetarian since he was a teenager attention deficit

socialism marxism marxism–leninism labor history labor unions libertarian socialism labor laws minimum wage socialism portal united states portal v t e hartmann is considered to have progressiveliberal politics although he describes himself as part of the radical middle he is the author of numerous books including unequal protection the rise of corporate dominance and the theft of human rights in which he argues that the  us supreme court decision in santa clara county v southern pacific railroad company  us  did not actually grant corporate personhood and that this doctrine derives from a mistaken interpretation of a supreme court clerks notes hartmann considers this a clear contradiction of the intent of the founding fathers of the united states he has also written on the separation of church and state drawing upon the federalist papers to argue that the founding fathers warned against the notion of the united states being a christian nation he contends that the  american election and  american election were stolen through electronic tampering denial of the voting franchise by rigged voting lists and limiting availability of voting machines in selected precincts he also accuses the bush administration of eroding democracy and individual freedoms hartmann is also a vocal critic of the effects of neoliberal globalization on the us economy claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of ronald reagan have led in large part to many american industrial enterprises being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs—once considered a major foundation of the us economy—being relocated to countries in asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the us and the concurrent reversal of the united states traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as china hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the american middle class whose survival hartmann deems critical to the survival of american democracy this argument is expressed in hartmanns  book screwed the undeclared war against the middle class and what we can do about it one of the books main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate medias shifting the american consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class in the book ultimate sacrifice he and coauthor lamar waldron argue that president john f kennedys assassination resulted from a conspiracy by two mafia godfathers carlos marcello and santo trafficante jr who took advantage of a proposed  usasponsored coup against cubas fidel castro to kill the president and then hide their tracks in the resulting coverup of the topsecret coup plans gore vidal in his autobiography point to point navigation devotes much of the final two chapters of his book to praising hartmanns and lamar waldrons scholarship in solving the jfk case jfk was a friend of vidals in a  interview with politico hartmann described his political philosophy as democratic socialism i’ve lived in europe i think that the countries that call themselves democratic socialist—germany france norway sweden denmark finland—have the most functional political and economic system so somebody says what’s your political philosophy i’d say democratic socialism but boy the crap you take when you say socialist because people don’t understand it they think i’m talking about sovietstyle socialism which i’m not personal lifeedit thom has been a vegetarian since he was a teenager attention deficit

individuals have the ability of rapidly shifting their focus and external attention and of holding multiple trains of thought this ability causes difficulties when they must live and work in cultures
