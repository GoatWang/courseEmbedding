best products showrooms by site    december  by david douglassjaimes save this article share in whatsapp save when art architecture and commerce collided the best products showrooms by site save this picture according to one survey images of the best products showroom in houston texas designed by site sculpture in the environment appeared in more books on thcentury architecture than any other building the intentionally crumbling brick at that houston store known as âindeterminate faÃ§adeâ and the eight other showrooms site designed were simultaneously iconic and controversial and most importantly for best they brought in customers although sitefounder james wines never considered himself a postmodernist architect his designs for best completed between  and  steeped in whimsical social commentary came to symbolize the essence of postmodernism today all but one of the best showrooms have been demolished or altered beyond recognition but they set a lasting precedent and continue to influence the use of architecture in corporate branding today  save this picture indeterminate facade image  site james wines began his career as a sculptor and visual artist he was part of the environmental art movement of the late s and early s along with artists such as robert smithson and gordon mattaclark which focused on taking the art scene beyond sterile gallery spaces and as wines described putting art where you would least expect it save this picture forest building image  site best products was a chain of catalogue showroom retail stores in the united states from the late s until the company went out of business in  the companyâs founders sydney and frances lewis were avid art collectors and in the early s they began working with winesâ environmental art and architecture studio on a series of buildings for the retail chain the lewises were interested in bringing their love of art to their retail business and working with wines and site rather than placing a piece of art out in front of the stores they wanted their stores to actually become the art save this picture notch building image  site wines saw the buildings as an exploration of the boundary between art and architecture and working from the starting point of the ubiquitous and familiar bigbox store archetype provided even greater freedom to blur the line siteâs work for best was often met with staunchly negative criticismâespecially following the completion of indeterminate faÃ§ade in houstonâby the mainstream architectural press who saw no place for humor in architecture but the lewises continued to support the work in spite of the critical response on the other hand winesâ friends and contemporariesâespecially in the art worldâenvied his freedom to create works that in their exploration of decay neglect and artificiality so obviously critiqued the throwaway nature of american consumer culture the source of his clientsâ business success save this picture cutler ridge building image  site despite the criticisms and the tongueincheek nature of the designs siteâs architecture helped fuel bestâs commercial success at the time that success has no doubt inspired other companies to pursue distinctive architecture as part of a branding strategy but in a recent conversation with archdaily wines was quick to point out that most companies want an infinitely replicable architectural identity that manifests as little more than decoration whereas each of the best stores though consistent in theme were each unique explorations of that theme in response to their individual contextspeeling building â richmond virginia â  save this picture peeling building image  site the first of siteâs buildings for best serves as a prelude to the social critiques and architectural acrobatics that would follow the brick faÃ§ade wall appears to be peeling away from the corner of the orthogonal box of the building envelope on one end and from the entire side of the building on the other the design is literally shedding the artifice to reveal the reality of the basic box underneath at the same time the peeling corner precariously extending over the walkway challenges traditional notions of the structural capabilities of brick  indeterminate faÃ§ade â houston texas â  save this picture the indeterminate faÃ§ade project continued to play on traditional notions of brick structures by presenting an intentionally distressed faÃ§ade that implies neglect and decay the seemingly crumbling parapet culminates in a deep gouge on the front faÃ§ade complimented by a corresponding rubblepile of bricks rising above the entrance portico in its preruined state the building seems to foreshadow its own eventual demise  tilt building â towson maryland â  save this picture tilt building image  site the most structurally daring of the completed best projects site worked extensively with structural engineers to create a counterbalance system that could enable the tilt faÃ§adeâs asymmetrical cantilever while maintaining the visual illusion of the floating brick wall although wines resists the postmodern classification historians marvin trachtenberg and isabelle hyman describe the tilt building as exemplifying and subverting the traditional venturiscott brown paradigm by simultaneously illustrating the concepts of both the âdecorated shedâ and the âduckâ as an ostensibly decorated box while âconnoting its meaning through it âsculpturalâ shape more than its nominal ornamentationâ  notch building â sacramento california â  save this picture notch building image  site the notch building challenges traditional notions of entrance and doorway creating a fortresslike uninterrupted brick box without any openings when the store is closed but when the store is open almost like the drawbridge of a medieval castle a small segment of the faÃ§ade slides away to reveal an entrance in the resulting ânotchâ once again site is suggesting decay in the seemingly random opening in the brick faÃ§ade  best antisign â richmond virginia â  save this picture best antisign image  site breaking from the previous best projects that had all explored various iterations of brick facades for the antisign site turned the entire building into giant sign repeating the name âbestâ across the faÃ§ade in giant letters that stretched the full height of the walls starting with a typical spacing at one end of the faÃ§ade the letters begin to overlap as the word repeats eventually terminating in an illegible jumble hinting at the highspeed experience of viewing the suburban built environment from a moving car  cutler ridge building â miami florida â  save this picture cutler ridge building image  site for the cutler ridge building site returned to masonry to explore a deconstructed version of the faÃ§ade that extends out into the parking lot in fact the entire faÃ§ade is completely separated from the actual building envelope the bulk of the faÃ§ade stands several feet in front of a glass curtain wall enclosure the portico seemingly ripped out of the main faÃ§ade and leaving a trademark jagged brick outline stands in the median of the driveway finally two lone doorways mark the ends of the rows of parking stalls as if bringing the store entrance as close as possible to shoppersâ cars save this picture cutler ridge building image  site  forest building â richmond virginia â  save this picture forest building image  site an existing forest on this site in richmond virginia almost prevented the building from being built at all until site proposed a design that would integrate the existing forest into the architecture of the showroom specialists spent months on the building site retraining the roots of the trees to grow away from structural footings and foundations and preserving the natural undergrowth allowing nature and architecture to coexist the result as wines describes in his book green architecture is a âmassive incision splitting the building apart and allowing giant oak trees and ground cover to march through the open chasmâ only later did wines realize that the added shading from the preserved trees significantly reduced the buildings need for air conditioning in summer months save this picture forest building image  site as of  the forest building is the only best showroom to remain in its original condition preserved by the west end presbyterian church which bought the building soon after best closed down in the late s  rainforest building â hialeah florida â  save this picture rainforest building image  site similar to the forest building the rainforest building was inspired by existing forest on the building site in this case existing plants were preserved off site during construction and then replaced as a part of a greenhouse faÃ§ade behind a glass water wall which used recirculated water to help reduce the cooling load of the building the innovations in the rainforest and forest buildings would go on to inspire a careerspanning interest in sustainable architecture and passive design strategies at site  insideoutside building â milwaukee wisconsin â  save this picture insideoutside building image  site siteâs final building for best presented the most striking architectural commentary of all designed as a lifesize cutaway diagram site removed large chunks of the masonry faÃ§ade revealing mechanical systems above the suspended ceilings as well as replica retail displays that exactly matched the displays on the inside of the glass curtain wall the stark display of monochrome imitation bicycles toys seemingly cut in half by the clear glass wall and the air ducts and dropped ceiling all seem to critique the artificiality of the products inside the store  references trachtenberg marvin and isabelle hyman architecture from prehistory to

arch student university of california los angeles abstract  potential applications of pupil dilation measures to consumer research are reviewed although the method is a valuable measure of mental activity in consumer tasks pupil dilations have limitations that will preclude their widespread use introduction eight years have elapsed since the last published review on pupil dilation measures in consumer behavior blackwell hensel and sternthal  the authors concluded that pupil dilations temporary changes in pupil size may be an effective measure of consumer response to advertising but were unsure what processes the dilations actually measured more recently several trends have been noted  a call by a number of researchers payne and ragsdale  russo  for joint methodologies to study consumer information processing leading to product choices the objective of multiple techniques is to improve the accuracy of process measurement  increased attention to eye fixations as a processtracing device in consumer behavior russo and rosen   a more definitive interpretation of what pupil dilations actually measure goldwater  based on these trends it is important to update the findings of blackwell et al to determine if pupil dilations are appropriate and practical measures for consumer behavior experimentation while pupil dilation measures might fill a void in the capabilities of current processtracing methods limitation of pupil dilation measures will likely prevent their widespread use the need for additional processtracing methods a recent review by russo  discusses five processtracing methods currently being used in consumer behavior chronometric analysis eye fixations information boards inputoutput analysis and verbal protocols one apparent weakness in all the current methods is the failure to measure the importance consumers place on individual information inputs ads information board cards etc as a basis for their response or choice in fact most methods rely on indirect measures of importance such as the subjects selfreport or avoid the question of importance entirely without a true measure of importance researchers are at a loss to explain the impact of information one of the areas where consumer behavior studies should have important inputs for marketers and policymakers pupil dilation eye pupils have been shown to dilate in response to autonomic activity in the nervous system with dilations ranging from  to over  millimeters while pupil dilations have been used in a number of psychophysical experiments see goldwater  for a review applications in consumer behavior have been limited and largely unsuccessful edgar hess and others hess  krugman  have employed pupil dilations as a measure of consumer affect to advertising the pupils were thought to dilate in response to pleasant stimuli and contract when viewing unpleasant stimuli subsequent studies woodmansee  have found no direct relationship between pupil dilations and affect king  used pupil size and eye direction of models depicted in advertisements as an independent variable in ad copy effectiveness study while kings manipulations were significant the experiment does not provide insights on the use of subject pupil dilation as a dependent variable in consumer behavior meanwhile psychophysiology experiments were establishing pupil dilation as a measure of the subjects mental effort expended in cognitive tasks hess and polt  found that peak dilations of subjects was related to the difficulty of arithmetic tasks kahneman and beatty  confirmed the findings of hess and polt in a different application shortterm memory tasks subjects pupil size was sensitive to the amount of information being processed the researchers proposed that variations of pupil size resulted from rehearsing a series of digits or words that would later have to be recalled beatty and kahneman  applied similar pupil size measurements in tasks involving more permanent memory processing stages were observed in the experimental task with peak dilations immediately following the presentation of the experimental task and a return to normal pupil size after the stimulus was reported by the subject due to the wider range of dilations observed the researchers concluded that longerterm memory tasks required greater mental effort than activities utilizing shortterm memory the subjects range of dilations was shown to diminish following extensive repetitions of a simple task showing that learning can reduce cognitive demands the above studies and others cited in goldwater  p  have provided support for the notion that pupil dilations reflect mental effort or activity if mental activity could be equated with importance of the stimulus to the individual pupil dilations would be a valuable addition to existing processtracing methods in consumer behavior but there are several apparent drawbacks  although mental activity has important associations with importance the relationship is not complete for example an unimportant stimulus could evoke substantial mental activity if it was difficult to perceive and understand the reverse may also be true an important stimulus might require little mental activity if it was already welllearned by the subject through prior repetition  pupil dilation measures simply reflect mental activity in themselves no clue is provided as to what is being processed but rather that processing is taking place subject protocols would also be required if the researcher wants to measure the meaning as well as the amount of mental activity one application of pupil dilation to consumer behavior does not require the effortimportance link public policy is concerned with optimum product information presentation to consumers pupil dilation measures could indicate the relative difficulty consumers experience in understanding different information presentation formats design problems in experiments employing pupil dilation measures like all other physiological measures pupil dilations are subject to a variety of distortions and interpretation problems tryon  discusses twentythree sources of pupil size variation with no indication that the listing is complete the following considerations are of particular importance  the light reflex is the strongest determinant of pupil size significant variations in the lighting used for the experiment would render the dilation results meaningless as a premeasure the subjects pupil dilation should be measured under standard light changes  subject factors such as age pupil unrest hippus drowsiness alertness arousal and physical measures such as heart rate and blood pressure have demonstrated effects on dilation the experimenter must consider these factors in subject selection and monitor physical signs during the experiment to aid in the interpretation of results  it is suggested that dilation experiments be conducted at roughly the same time of day using subjects with the same number of hours sleep the experimental sessions should be as brief as possible to control for subject habituation to the task  the amount of incentive the degree of motor or verbal response required and the information load resulting from the instructions to the subject should be held constant  the lid closure blinking reflex results in a momentary pupil contraction followed by a dilation the subject should be told when to blink to control for the distortion of results woodmansee  states that a delayed dilation response to a stimulus may change the baseline for measuring the pupillary effects of the next stimulus clearly a separation between stimulus presentation must be maintained if the response to each stimulus is to be measured simpson and paivio  have found that dilation effects are increased if motor responses or verbal protocols are required concurrent with the stimulus presentation unless the experimenter wishes to measure the total dilation for all activities or has a proven method of partialling out these effects any motor or verbal activity should be separated from stimulus presentation in summary effective use of pupil dilation measures in a consumer behavior experiment involving visual stimuli should include  a constant light source videotape monitors or a cathode ray tube crt device would be effective for this purpose since both permit contrast adjustments to a midrange of illumination  consistent presentation formats for visual stimuli typed pages or transparencies would be acceptable if the same order and organization is used for all stimuli  separation of presentation and response so that the individual dilation effects can be measured intervals allowing for return of pupils to baseline levels would aid in the interpretation of results  control of subject factors prior to and during the experiment careful selection of a reasonably homogenous subject group and proper instructions as to desired eye fixations and blinking are essential a high degree of equipment sensitivity is required for proper monitoring of pupil dilations beatty and kahneman  observed average pupil size changes of  millimeters or less in their cognitive load studies pupil magnification would help to correct but not eliminate the problem of minute measurement proper monitoring of pupil dilation also requires measurement several types of pupillometers commercial devices that measure pupil size are suitable for pupil dilation experiments pupillometers are available that record pupil size from  to  times per second a measurement frequency used in current physiological experiments one manufacturer produces a device that simultaneously measures eye fixation and pupil dilations a dedicated computer is required to consolidate the idea produced by the dilation experiment several technical computers can be used in conjunction with a pupillometer and are capable of presenting experimental output in a variety of forms ranging from raw data on pupil size to computerplotted graphs potential applications of pupil dilation in consumer research several applications of pupil dilation in consumer behavior experiments are proposed as examples of the potential utility of the measure  as a measure of mental activity associated with subjects cognitive responses to persuasive messages wright   as a processing effort measure associated with verbal protocols subject reports of their processing activity can be associated with pupil dilations on an online basis payne and ragsdale  or in the form of a prompted protocol where the subject verbalizes his her thoughts relative to a previous task russo and rosen   as a mental activity measure associated with successive fixations in eye movement analysis russo  these applications are tentative at best with a host of experimental design questions yet to be solved discussion although pupil dilation measures have potential value in consumer research limitations of the method are also apparent measurement of pupil size is an exacting science and few researchers can afford the equipment required even with the most sophisticated devices experimental conditions would have to be exceedingly precise to avoid confounding the dilation results verbal stimuli are preferred to visual presentations in order to avoid light reflex effects obtrusive measurement of pupil size is not considered to be a problem since pupil dilations are veridical representations of mental activity but pupil dilation measures are totally impractical in any setting but the laboratory restricting their research applications to lab experiments most researchers therefore will probably settle for secondbest measures of importance and mental activity or beg the question entirely still the potential benefits of pupil dilation measures might warrant further feasibility studies in consumer research references jackson beatty and daniel kahneman  pupillary
