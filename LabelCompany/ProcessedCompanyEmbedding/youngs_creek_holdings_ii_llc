supplement we will use the net proceeds after the payment of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions from our sale of securities for general corporate purposes which may include among other things • paying or refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness outstanding at the time and • funding working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions which may consist of acquisitions of discrete assets or businesses the actual application of proceeds from the sale of any particular offering of securities using this prospectus will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to such offering the precise amount and timing of the application of these proceeds will depend upon our funding requirements and the availability and cost of other funds the coal industry is highly competitive we compete with other coal producers with traders and resellers of coal and with other energy producers throughout the us and for our export sales internationally the most important factors on which we compete with other coal producers and with traders and resellers of coal are coal price coal quality and characteristics costs to transport the coal customer service and the reliability of supply demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic and foreign electric generation industries these coal consumption patterns are influenced by factors beyond our control including weather and economic conditions the supply and demand for domestic and foreign electricity domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes environmental and other regulatory changes global climate change initiatives technological developments the price and availability of other fuels such as natural gas and crude oil the availability of subsidies and renewable mandates designed to encourage greater use of alternative energy sources including hydroelectric nuclear wind and solar power and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which can decrease demand for thermal coal or may decrease demand for prb coal compared to other global coal basins because most of the coal in the vicinity of our mines is owned by the us federal government we compete with other coal producers operating in the prb for additional coal through the lba process this process is competitive and we expect the competition for lbas to remain strong company description we are one of the largest producers of coal in the united states of america us and the powder river basin prb based on our  coal sales we operate some of the safest mines in the coal industry according to the most current mine safety and health administration msha data we have one of the lowest employee all injury incident rates among the largest us coal producing companies we currently operate solely in the prb the lowest cost region of the major coal producing regions in the us where we own and operate three surface coal mines the antelope mine the cordero rojo mine and the spring creek mine we also have two major development projects the youngs creek project and the crow project our antelope and cordero rojo mines are located in wyoming and our spring creek mine is located in montana our mines produce subbituminous thermal coal with low sulfur content and we sell our coal primarily to domestic electric utilities thermal coal is primarily consumed by electric utilities and industrial consumers as fuel for electricity generation in  the coal we produced generated approximately  of the electricity produced in the us we do not produce any metallurgical coal as of december   we controlled approximately  billion tons of proven and probable reserves cloud peak
