cornerstone news logo navigation monday  may  ·         market recap ·         going forward ·         on a lighter note             volume  number      may    april was an abnormally cool and dry month which has delayed spring and will result in very high pollen levels in may  the toronto weather was reflected in the canadian market as well  the tsx was down  on a combination of increasing deficit  billion a collapse in the price of gold and a continued back up and lack of delivery of western canadian oil  the inability to deliver western canadian oil has resulted in producers having to sell at a discount to west texas international wti  per barrel by as much as   this massive discount is resulting in royalty tax losses of over  billion to the government of alberta and  billion to the federal government   the ‘end of the world’ scenario has been removed from global investors’ minds thanks to coordinated central bank massive monetary easing  while this has been very positive for the us stock market it concurrently collapsed the price of gold ounce and resulted in very large losses for all the mining stocks on the canadian tsx   stuart investment management limited’s allocation model of  canadian equities us equities cash has recently been pared back to approximately  canadian us cash as we took advantage of the strong moves in some of our holdings  having raised cash we are waiting to invest it when markets are at more favourable lower levels  we are not going to ‘sell in may and go away’  in fact we believe that any market selloff would be a good time to deploy your cash into largecap well managed companies   as spring progresses we believe the us federal government will continue to collect larger than planned tax revenues resulting in a very favourable tail wind for the dow and sp equity markets       courtesy of eli stein posted by cornerstoneadmin at  no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest

premium pricing   the improvement in the us equity markets above may have had something to do with foreigners dumping canadian securities in december as they sold  billion of canadian equities primarily tendering canadian shares to foreign direct investors acquiring control of large canadian assets foreign holdings of canadian bonds also fell by  million caused mainly by large debt retirements and coupon payments for the year  foreigners bought  billion in canadian securities down from  billion in  simultaneously canadians almost doubled their investment in securities abroad to  billion in  from  billion in  canadian finance minister jim flaherty asked the canadian senate to study pricing differentials between the us and canada which had become more blatantly obvious to canadian taxpayersvoters as the canadian and us dollars traded near par with each other for several months last year a bank of montreal  study of a basket of goods concluded that canadian domestic prices were on average about  higher than those in the usa one of the more blatant examples was auto parts where the pricing differentials could be as much as  for identical parts canadian import tariffs government regulations high transportation costs a more costly distribution system due to the population density in canada and the protectionist supply management system for eggs poultry and dairy products are all partly to blame this study has opened the door to eventually lowering tariffs on some consumer products to try to stem the increase in crossborder shopping which costs canadian businesses billions of dollars each year   canadians have gone back to borrowing as the average consumer’s debt load increased  to  at yearend  encouraged by low interest rates so far the delinquency rates are still fairly low but this will change rapidly with any increase in interest ratesat the same time the royal bank reported that small declines in home prices and mortgage rates made housing

sea   the us lumbers into sequestration   january  saw the us government budget post its first surplus in  years with a small  billion surplus as a result of the expiry of a payroll tax reduction on january  which brought in an extra  billion in revenue the equivalent number for january  was a deficit of  billion before too much cheering starts the  billion surplus should be compared as a percentage of the  billion deficit for the fiscal year ended september   the us trade deficit also narrowed to  billion its lowest point in  years pointing to stronger gdp growth after a stagnant th quarter at  growth  as reported in past “market commentaries” the ongoing crisis at the us postal service and its huge deficit has resulted in it cutting saturday mail services in an attempt to trim  billion in costs after its  billion loss for the previous year an obviously biased survey says that “a majority of the american public understands the financial challenges of the postal service and supports these steps…” somehow cutting services  whilst raising prices does not appear to be a good way to compete with the internet which will continue to erode their basic business most of the postal service’s losses were due to bloated labour costs and retiree health benefits significantly the democrats refused to support a house motion to extend the pay freeze for  million federal workers and budget hawks claim that the average us federal worker’s median compensation of  is nearly double the median household income the national treasury employees union president however claimed “…federal workers have contributed far more than any other wage group to economic recovery and deficit reduction”   us oil production grew more in  than in any year in the  year history of the domestic oil industry according to tom fowler of the wall street journal earlier this year us oil production topped  million barrels per day the highest since  and is expected to top  million barrels

the  trillion foreign exchange market has jolted itself back to life as institutional investors return to the market and volumes spiked in january strong global mergers and acquisitions volumes and perceptions of a rapidly weakening yen allowing a return of the ‘yen carry trade’ have also helped boost forex volumes february  saw the beginning of the chinese year of the snake after the year of

meteorite streaked across the sky above central russia at  miles per second giving off a supersonic boom that shattered thousands of windows wreaked havoc with mobile phone networks and could be seen

formation of the sudbury and norilsk mineral deposits the eurozone slipped deeper into recession in the last quarter of  rounding out the year with negative growth of  even the powerhouse germany contracted  in the fourth quarter its worst performance since the financial crisis in  germany however did achieve its first budget surplus of € billion in  its first in five years france’s weak performance forced her prime minister to acknowledge that his deficit goal for  is out of reach as further contraction is expected with no eurozone growth expected before  and then only at  the european commission predicted unemployment will peak at  or  million people more than the netherlands population in    britain suffered its first ever sovereign ratings downgrade as moody’s stripped the country of its pristine “aaa” rating causing severe financial embarrassment to finance minister osborne the usa and france have already been stripped of these ratings by at least one ratings agency and can the other agencies be far behind mcgrawhill companies inc’s standard  poor’s rating agency finds itself in a conundrum with the us government after being formally charged with a  billion fraud by the same government for its ratings of some of the toxic mortgage backed securities in the  financial crisis there are questions as to whether other major ratings agencies including moody’s will face similar lawsuits italy took more than its normal share of the headlines with the election of a totally fractured government where the lead party is headed by an economically very literate and populist former comedian  and exprime minister “bunga bunga berlusconi” appears to be the king maker with the two losing parties a new election is predicted within the year the other great italian shock was the unexpected resignation at the end of february of the first german bishop of rome pope benedict from the catholic church citing his declining physical and mental strength leaving a church in the midst of scandals in several countries and a crisis of confidence in the  year old church he is the first pope to retire voluntarily in almost  years as we write this the cardinals are sequestered in the sistine chapel to elect his replacement which will probably be announced before you read this but canadian cardinal marc ouellet appears to be a strong candidate for the fisherman’s ring others are arguing strongly that it is time for an african or south american pope as those are the areas where the catholic church is still showing growth as most of the western countries are becoming either more secular or more muslim the lord will display the answer soon                                                                    tax slips   we have mailed most  tax

                                                    canada’s day in the sun   the good news for the canadian economy continues as it appears that the usa may finally be creeping out of its almost  year slump canada’s november gdp grew a better than expected  after a tepid  in october and statscan said that “most major industrial sectors increased production in november” while canada’s manufacturing pmi growth was hovering at a two year low hurt by a stronger dollar and a weak global economy employment continued to rise by  jobs in december with the canadian jobless rate at a four year low of  this picture was in contrast to the us position where job growth was a disappointing  for december canada has now recovered all of the jobs lost during the  recession whilst inflation has remained below the bank of canada’s  target these results are expected to strengthen the canadian dollar over the us dollar in  after some initial bumps due to the us politicians squabbling over spending cuts and debt limits the bank of canada has stuck to its aggressive line on rates unlike most other major central banks that are slashing rates or printing money to stimulate growth   last month we reported that canadian auto sales hit the second highest level on record in  with nearly  million units sold which was just below the previous record sales of  million vehicles in  auto manufacturers are optimistic that this record will be shattered this year us auto sales in  rose more than  percent to  million cars and trucks a four and a half year increasing trend and general motors has forecast an increase to between  million and  million for  by contrast new car registrations in europe went into ‘freefall’ last year with an  drop to  million vehicles car sales in portugal dropped  and in greece  with the biggest slump in cypress with a  drop only sweden and great britain posted gains in  the canadian government responded to the good news in canada by pouring  million into the automotive innovation fund the author wonders why taxpayers’ money should be handed to an industry which has just had its second best year on record following the automotive theme most canadians do not know that mexico now produces approximately  more auto vehicles than canada does with  production numbers not sales of  versus canada’s  vehicles for the same year this theme is behind some of siml’s interest in us and canadian railroads which are transporting increasing amounts of auto parts and completed autos between the three nafta nations in addition they are rapidly increasing the business of shipping canadian heavy oil and or bakken sweet crude to the gulf coast mid west and east coast refiners by rail to take advantage of the crude spread differentials between brent crude west texas intermediate crude and canadian heavy crude which are caused by current pipeline bottlenecks last month we reported on standard  poor’s downgrading of the ratings of the six large canadian banks not to be outdone moody’s followed suit and the td bank lost its coveted ‘aaa’ rating which was higher than the us government’s rating and it was downgraded to ‘aa’ the royal bank of canada topped the canadian tables as the top financial advisor in  with  announced merger  acquisition deals worth  billion or  of the market in equity and debt issuances the royal bank also led with  billion in  transactions and  billion in  issues respectively enbridge inc announced  million worth of oil pipeline expansions in both canada and the usa in an attempt to take advantage of the spread differentials currently being experienced by some of the oil producers this comes as the international energy agency has predicted that the output from alberta’s oil sands alone is expected to almost triple to  million barrels per day by  enbridge anticipates the new expansions will be in service by  the much ballyhooed debut of research in motion ltd’s new blackberry  operating system and its new series of phones was unveiled on january   to mostly favourable reviews and also a change in corporate identity with the company being renamed blackberry inc the new phones were sold out within hours in canada but their release in the usa was delayed pending carrier certification of the new operating system the blackberry shares have rallied from a low of  in november  to a recent high of  in anticipation of this relaunch   us leaps from ‘the cliff’ to sequestration   the us gdp unexpectedly contracted  in the fourth quarter with most of the drop being caused by slower inventory growth and the deepest spending cuts in  years without the two latter factors the economy would have grown a respectable  for the quarter economists were encouraged by the acceleration in consumer spending and the rebound in business investment which they felt pointed to some fundamental economic strength whilst private sector payrolls expanded by  jobs in january after increasing  in december economists felt that a sustained growth pace in excess of  pa would be needed over a longer period to lower the jobless rate of  the republican controlled house of representatives voted to extend the us debt ceiling to may   but allows the government ‘to borrow what is needed’ above the current debt ceiling of  trillion handing congress a blank cheque is never a good idea meanwhile the us federal reserve bank’s unprecedented bond buying pushed the fed’s balance sheet to a record  trillion as it prints more money and buys more newlyissued government bonds with the money incroyable the us trade deficit continued to widen to  billion as imports increased by  whilst exports only increased  markets were expecting the deficit to shrink housing starts concurrently climbed to the highest rate since the crash in june  with a  surge to a  unit annualized rate with the increasing confidence of us consumers so rose consumer credit for the fourth consecutive month giving further hope to a strengthening economy likewise us shopping mall vacancies declined for the fifth straight quarter but class “a” malls with luxury retailers still boasted lower vacancies than more mainstream malls in spite of data feed glitches the nasdaq omx group reported higher fourth quarter revenues as nontrading revenues overcame a drop in trading revenues the us labor department reported that the percentage of unionized workers dropped to  in  the lowest level in  years as several states have passed “right to work” laws making payment of union dues voluntary for workers union membership peaked in  with  of workers represented by organized labor unionization is still strongest in the public sector at  where wage and benefit generosity is condoned by politicians seeking short term votes with taxpayer’s money unionization in the private sector was just  with private sector workers earning on average  less than public sector workers  after the best year for north american auto sales since

import and export business totaling  trillion versus the comparable figure of  trillion for the usa for many nations around the world china is now their most important bilateral trade partner with all the attendant political clout that goes therewith china’s economy posted its slowest growth since  in the year ended december   at  but still a number in the acceptable range for providing jobs to newly graduated students entering the workforce meanwhile  chinese companies that had listed on us stock exchanges announced plans to go private to avoid the increased scrutiny being given them by the us regulators after a number of stock market frauds by chinese based companies  the international labour organization estimated that  million people will be jobless this year globally out of a total population of approximately  billion with a lot of these classified as ‘discouraged workers’ who have given up all hope of a job unemployment in the eurozone hit a new high of  million or  on average with unemployment rates ranging up to  for youth under  in greece  spain meanwhile the default rate on ‘junkbonds’ globally has finally started to drop ending the year at  of all bonds issued helped by the low interest rate policy of the federal reserve bank and other central banks the new japanese government being a prime example with simulative spending of  billion to boost businesses in spite of concerns on the current level of japanese public debt the eurozone seems determined to shoot itself in the foot by implementing a ‘financial transactions tax’ in germany france and nine other countries sweden and britain have opposed these taxes as the transactions will merely move to friendlier jurisdictions with the consequent further drops in high paying service jobs in the financial sector spain’s largest and most international bank the bank santander sees its profitability rebounding in  as it works its way out from under a portfolio of bad real estate loans santander is eyeing

minute deal in the us congress managed to postpone the worst effects of the ‘fiscal cliff’ into the future overall all the major north american markets closed up with the us markets up substantially for the year the ‘laggard’ was the tsx  up ‘only’  for  whilst the dow jones industrial average the s  p  and the nasdaq soared with gains of   and a stunning  respectively the canadian dollar popped  over the year to us from us at december   even though it dropped  in december  the month of december was remarkable in that the tsx significantly outperformed most of the us markets with a  gain whilst the us markets were almost flat in spite of the fiscal cliff euphoria   canada’s days lengthen again   canadian auto sales finished the year relatively strong but the major surprise was that the once mighty general motors has slipped to third place behind ford motor company with  sales and chrysler in second place for the first time in four decades and is just ahead of toyota motors in canada gm’s sales of  units were less than half of their peak sales of  vehicles in  overall canadian auto sales improved  year over year in  to nearly  million units — just shy of their previous peak in  of  million vehicles despite december sales falling  from the same month a year ago industry pundits are hoping for a record year in  and feel that general motors sales will benefit from the release of a number of new models in  despite selling over  units of its “f series” fullsized pickup trucks to hold the top spot for three successive years ford’s market share slipped to  from  in  as south korean manufacturers hyundai and kia gained market share and toyota and honda bounced back after product recalls and the tsunami in    the canadian trade deficit narrowed by almost  billion as exports surged and imports declined  exports were led by energy exports which rose  to  billion which was the third consecutive monthly increase in this sector with the other major components of this gain being farm fishing and intermediate food products canada’s prudent fiscal structure and stronger currency were also major factors in foreign purchases of canadian securities which increased  billion for the month of october alone predominantly the purchase of canadian corporate bonds placed in the united states in us dollars simultaneously canadians halved their purchases of foreign securities to  billion for the month to the end of october foreigners purchased  billion worth of canadian securities up from  billion for the same period in  significantly the largest portion of equity purchases for the period appears to be for oil and gas companies   in spite of the good news in canada standard  poor’s lowered their ratings on several canadian financial institutions including the bank of nova scotia national bank of canada laurentian bank caisse centrale desjardins central  credit union and home capital group despite these downgrades the ratings for canadian banks remain among the highest in the world   us moves ‘the cliff’ backwards   last month we reported that two us citizens did not have to worry about financial planning for a while after winning the us million “powerball” lottery apparently this is not necessarily the case as recently another chicago man a winner of  million in the illinois lottery died of cyanide poisoning less than two months after winning and before having received his cheque from the lottery corporation    the us congress were pummeled into a last minute compromise which temporarily avoided the ‘fiscal cliff’ on january  but did not deal with the us government’s debt ceiling which currently is limited to  trillion and treasury officials say theyll run out of money to pay all the governments obligations sometime in february or march if congress doesnt raise this limit on their borrowing authority after being forced to back down in the fiscal cliff horsetrading republicans have said they will seek major spending cuts in exchange for any agreement to raise the debt limit and president obama has said he wont negotiate on the debt limit more uncertainty in the markets the us congress did back a bill authorizing a  billion defense budget for    the current account deficit in the us narrowed  in the third quarter to  billion the smallest in two years as imports slowed in response to cooling demand in the us the trade deficit which accounts for the largest portion of the current account deficit widened  as exports suffered the largest drop in nearly four years weakening exports are a reflection of the slowing global demand especially in china and debtridden europe   last month we reported on the selloff of the us treasury department’s remaining stake in american international group inc which purportedly resulted in a combined  billion ‘profit’ to the us treasury and the federal reserve bank the treasury recently announced that it planned to sell off its shares in about two thirds of the remaining  banks that took ‘bailout’ money from the government during the  financial   crisis in total these banks owe the treasury about  billion which should be compared to the  billion originally lent to just aig the treasury claims that it has recovered over  billion or  of the  billion it disbursed through the troubled asset relief program in interest and repayments as they announced the impending sales of these bank shares foreign demand for us equities and debt has declined by  billion as international investors seek better returns elsewhere   manufacturing contracted in november due to ‘superstorm sandy’ and also worries over the resolution of the fiscal cliff just as indicators are showing some signs of recovery in manufacturing in china which usually leads to later orders from us manufacturers auto sales in the us tracked those in canada with sales at a five year high of  million vehicles in november the highest since  and the financial crisis with total  sales of  million vehicles since  average auto purchase prices have risen  to an average of  from  us home prices also rose in  for their first gain in  years albeit off a low base low interest rates higher employment rates and prices that are still  below their july  peaks have encouraged home buyers to reenter the market fuelling a ‘virtuous circle’ which will drive economic growth housing construction and price increases   the us banking industry posted its highest earnings since  in the third quarter with earnings of  billion up  from a year earlier the improving economy also allowed the banks to reduce their loss provisions by  yearoveryear bank deposits however surged to  trillion more than bank loans as the threat of a slowing economy tempered loan demand and lenders tightened loan standards as borrowers were deleveraging increasing cash balances were being deposited with the same banks banks are lending on average  for every  in deposits which is below the mid  range deemed optimal for a wellrun bank another sign of increased consumer liquidity is investors poured  billion into stock exchange traded funds etfs well offsetting outflows from stock mutual funds   over the past  months or so we have documented here the ongoing attempts at takeovers of assorted stock exchanges globally the trend is still alive with another  billion bid for the venerable new york stock exchange nyse euronext by the upstart intercontinentalexchange inc this bid at a  premium to the closing market price was approved by the directors  major owners of nyse euronext if the takeover is approved by regulators it will mark the end of the dinosaur age with its open outcry on the nyse floor as all of intercontinentalexchange’s existing markets are  computerbased with no actual floor traders at the same time the nasdaq stock exchange in the us was forced to cancel premarket trades in nine large capitalization stocks due to a programming glitch which caused wild swings in the prices of these shares freeportmcmoran copper  gold inc announced a deal to buy plains exploration  production co and mcmoran exploration co for  billion shareholders were unimpressed with this supposed ‘diversification’ move as freeport had spun out mcmoran exploration several years ago as a ‘dediversification’ move the freeport shares promptly dropped  in response to the announcement   sadly general norman schwarzkopf the commander of the us forces who routed and humiliated the iraqi army in a six week war to eject them after they invaded kuwait in  died at his home in florida at the age of    international roundup   in  geopolitical jitters will dominate the markets and the world worries about concerns with israel and iran rattling swords an ongoing civil war in syria unrest in egypt where the rules of democracy apparently have allowed muslim hardliners to hijack their new constitution and china and japan in raucous territorial disputes over offshore islands   in response to worries about their large neighbor japanese retail investors poured  billion into a mutual fund that invests primarily in us canadian and mexican shares as an attempt to shield their wealth from regional problems this was the third biggest raise ever for a japanese mutual fund in china the factory sector is bouncing back somewhat to its strongest level since may  and the country is on course to achieve growth of  for  the chinese foreign exchange regulator has increased the  billion limit on sovereign wealth funds central banks and other monetary authorities who wish to buy chinese assets through their qualified institutional investor program by a factor of ten india’s current account deficit hit a record high of  billion or  of gdp in the third quarter as export growth slowed sharply and imports of gold and oil surged india’s factory output however rose  off a very low base boosted by increased demand during the festive season in india   the european central bank said it will continue to supply eurozone banks with ‘all the liquidity they ask for’ in the central bank’s refinancing operations until at least july  europe’s second largest economy france has been warned by the fitch bond rating agency that it will reach the maximum debt level it can tolerate in  without losing its only remaining “aaa” credit rating and there was no room for slippage on the part of socialist president hollande’s government the president very unwisely retorted publically that “france does not determine its economic policies according to credit rating agencies…”   finally queen elizabeth ii became the first monarch to attend a cabinet meeting of the british government since george iii did so in  her visit was part of the jubilee celebrations to mark her  years on the throne her visit was

the current account deficit increased  million to  billion as exports declined  billion and imports likewise declined  billion the total canadian federal debt has just exceeded the  billion mark but as we remarked previously the debt burden is now growing slower than the growth in gdp which is a good trend to continue the job growth in canada was also increasing more than expected which is a good

a narrower trade deficit and inventory gains overshadowed a smaller gain in consumer spending exports rose  as imports rose only  as the quantity of imported oil fell even as oil prices rose somewhat

november  volume  number  the markets were mainly on the downside as october dragged into the november us presidential election and the major us markets were unexpectedly closed for the last two days of the month by hurricane sandy the tsx was the only market up with a  gain whilst the dow jones industrial index the s  p  and the nasdaq markets were down   and  respectively the canadian dollar dropped  to us from us at september   october  marked the th anniversary of “black monday” on october   when the largest oneday percentage decline in recorded stock market history occurred with a drop of  points or  on the dow jones industrial index coincidentally wikipedia lists a total of  other “black mondays” in recorded history since  canada sets the clocks back  we have commented before on canada’s progress in reducing the deficit after the  market meltdown and the final figures for the  came in slightly higher than anticipated at  billion which was down from  billion in  and under half of the  billion deficit in  the deficit was helped by the government tax revenues increasing by  billion or  with program expenses rising only  million or  the federal debt for the year increased by  billion to a total of  billion but this growth rate in debt was lower than the growth in gdp which is a good trend to continue the deficit has dropped almost  for the first five months of the  fiscal year at  billion down from  billion last year well on track to exceed the current target of  billion for this fiscal year statistics canada adopted new standards which resulted in the canadian second quarter growth rate being revised up to  from  but resulted in no other major changes other good news saw canadian employment rising five times faster than economists had predicted in september but the jobless rate rose to  from  as the labour force expanded by  and average hourly wages also grew  year over year bloomberg economics is predicting a  unemployment rate in canada for  and  for the following year whilst canadian households packed on record debt at  of disposable income the canadian federal government is one of the very few country’s governments to have an unblemished debt rating the other five countries who remain in this exclusive club are australia denmark norway sweden and switzerland the shortage of “aaa” – “risk free” debt available to investors is causing headaches for major institutional investors who are statutebound to invest a large portion of their assets in “aaa” rated paper which has now dropped to only about  of issued global government debt after the usa was downgraded in  the condominium market appears to be finally slowing down in toronto after years of torrid growth new condo sales in canada’s largest city plunged  in the third quarter from second quarter sales levels and resale condos also dropped  this has caused developers to delay starts on new projects the average time from sales launch to occupancy jumped to  years and there are projected to be  condo completions in  to be added to the current unsold inventory of  condos this potential inventory number should be compared to the alltime record sales of  condos sold in  the canada

estimated  million in a very similar deal the  billion texas teachers’ pension fund bought a  stake in the formula  motor racing series this writer questions the rationale for these types of egodriven purchases with pensioner’s money and predicts that they will not end well in our last market commentary we commented on the negative effects of the newlyelected quebec ‘pequist’ government blocking the takeover of rona inc by the lowes companies inc apparently quebec is not the only shortsighted government as the canadian federal government has totally rejected the proposed  billion takeover of astral media inc by bce inc bell canada’s parent company on the grounds that it is not in the interest of canadian subscribers the same government has also “postponed” the decision to allow the  billion acquisition of progress energy resources by the malaysian state oil firm petronas bhd giving petronas  days to ‘adjust’ its offer the real agenda behind the petronas delay is indecision behind the much larger  billion proposed acquisition of nexen inc by chinese state oil company cnooc ltd if we keep frightening off foreign purchasers of canadian assets we will never raise the billions of dollars in capital required to develop the oil sands and shale gas resources and install exportoriented liquefied natural gas plants in canada at the same time transcanada corp of calgary has entered

number of ‘groundbreaking firsts’ which never affected his humanity and his warm touch with the common man us decision day as we write this the us electorate has cast their vote for barack obama to be their leader for the next four years his first priority of business will be to deal with the looming ‘fiscal cliff’ before congress breaks for christmas next month and failure to deal effectively with this will be negative for the markets for months to come the election came  days after the devastating hurricane sandy left large tracts of new england devastated and suffering power outages and fuel and food shortages new jersey was particularly hard hit and subsequently suffered a force  earthquake as residents were trying to clean up for the first time since  the weather stopped us equity trading for two consecutive days as the nyse and the nasdaq markets closed to ensure the safety of their staff conveniently and coincidentally just before the election statistics emanating from the usa indicate that its economy was growing more than forecast at  in the third quarter backed by increasing consumer spending gains in residential construction and significantly ‘a rebound in government outlays’ us manufacturing growth ‘unexpectedly expanded in september’ and according to the labor department the us jobless rate suddenly dropped from  to  in september – “the lowest rate since president barack obama took office in january ” these rosy statistics cannot hide the fact that the us budget deficit topped  trillion for the fourth consecutive year even with a budget surplus of  billion for september the final month of the  fiscal year the chinese government showed its mistrust of the us bond market by reducing its holdings of us treasuries to  trillion just as the japanese government raised its stake in us treasuries to  trillion and appears set to become the us’s largest creditor chairman ben bernanke of the us federal reserve has indicated he will not stand for a third term as chairman of the federal reserve when his term ends in january  irrespective of who wins the election conocophillips a siml favourite announced lower third quarter profits but still

years which will weaken the export led recovery the chinese government is hoping for just as the government offered  million in loan subsidies to importers for the purchase of advanced technological
