investment strategies the fund invests primarily in a portfolio of us treasury and government agency securities maturing in  days or less these investments include repurchase agreements collateralized fully by us treasury and government agency securities the dollarweighted average maturity of the funds portfolio will be  days or less t he funds investment adviser adviser targets a dollarweighted average portfolio maturity range based upon its interest rate outlook the adviser formulates its interest rate outlook by analyzing a variety of factors such as current us economic activity and the economic outlook current shortterm interest rates the federal reserve boards policies regarding shortterm interest rates and the potential effects of foreign economic activity on us shortterm interest rate s the adviser generally shortens the portfolios dollarweighted average maturity when it expects interest rates to rise and extends the maturity when it expects interest rates to fall the adviser selects securities used to shorten or extend the portfolios dollarweighted average maturity by comparing the returns currently offered by different investments to their historical and expected returns what are the principal securities in which the fund invests r fixedincome securities r r fixedincome securities pay interest dividends or distributions at a specified rate the rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically in addition the issuer of a fixedincome security must repay the principal amount of the security normally within a specified time the following describes the principal types of fixedincome securities in which the fund may invest  r us treasury securities us treasury securities are direct obligations of the federal government of the united states agency securities agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a federal agency or other government sponsored entity gse acting under federal authority some gse securities are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states these include the government national mortgage association small business administration farm credit system financial assistance corporation farmers home administration federal financing bank general services administration department of housing and urban development exportimport bank overseas private investment corporation and washington metropolitan area transit authority bonds r other gse securities receive support through federal subsidies loans or other benefits for example the us treasury is authorized to purchase specified amounts of securities issued by or otherwise make funds available to the federal home loan bank system federal home loan mortgage corporation federal national mortgage association student loan marketing association and tennessee valley authority in support of such obligations r r a few gse securities have no explicit financial support but are regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors their activities these include the farm credit system financing corporation and resolution funding corporation r r investors regard agency securities as having low credit risks but not as low as treasury securities r r the fund treats mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by a gse as if issued or guaranteed by a federal agency r r although such a guarantee protects against credit risks it does not reduce market and prepayment risks r repurchase agreements repurchase agreements are transactions in which a fund buys a security from a dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back at a mutually agreedupon time and price the repurchase price exceeds the sale price reflecting the funds return on the transaction this return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying security the fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as securities dealers deemed creditworthy by the adviser repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks what are the specific risks of investing in the fund interest rate risk r prices of fixedincome securities rise and fall in response to changes in the interest rate paid by similar securities generally when interest rates rise prices of fixedincome securities fall however market factors such as the demand for particular fixedincome securities may cause the price of certain fixedincome securities to fall while the prices of other securities rise or remain unchanged r r interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixedincome securities with longer maturities money market funds try to minimize this risk by purchasing shortterm securities r credit risk credit risk includes the possibility that a party to a transaction involving the fund will fail to meet its obligations this could cause the fund to lose the benefit of the transaction or prevent the fund from selling or buying other securities to implement its investment strategy

consequences for the fund and its shareholders for this reason and because the fund is intended to be used as a liquid shortterm investment the funds board has not adopted policies or procedures to discourage frequent or shortterm trading of the funds shares however the fund may limit or terminate the availability of purchases or exchanges to a shareholder and may bar the shareholder from purchasing shares of other federated funds if the funds management or adviser determines from the amount frequency or pattern of purchases and redemptions or exchanges that the shareholder is engaged

that was established under the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts on january   the board of trustees the board has established two classes of shares of the fund known as investment shares and retirement shares shares this sai relates to both classes of shares the funds investment adviser is passport research ltd adviser the adviser is a limited partnership jointly owned by edward jones and a subsidiary of federated investors inc r securities in which the fund invests in pursuing its investment strategy the fund may invest in the following securities for any purpose that is consistent with its investment objective the fund is permitted to invest in any high quality money market instrument as a matter of investment policy however the fund presently limits its investments to the us government securities and government agency securities described in the prospectus and repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities the purpose of this policy is to minimize any credit risk associated with the funds investments this policy may be changed at the discretion of the board securities descriptions and techniques fixed income securities fixed income securities pay interest dividends or distributions at a specified rate the rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically in addition the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the principal amount of the security normally within a specified time fixed income securities provide more regular income than equity securities however the returns on fixed income securities are limited and normally do not increase with the issuers earnings this limits the potential appreciation of fixed income securities as compared to equity securities a securitys yield measures the annual income earned on a security as a percentage of its price a securitys yield will increase or decrease depending upon whether it costs less a discount or more a premium than the principal amount if the issuer may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity the price and yield on a discount or premium security may change based upon the probability of an early redemption securities with higher risks generally have higher yields in addition to the us government securities and government agency securities described in the prospectus and subject to its present policy described above the following describes types of fixed income securities in which the fund may invest corporate debt securities corporate debt securities are fixed income securities issued by businesses notes bonds debentures and commercial paper are the most prevalent types of corporate debt securities the fund may also purchase interests in bank loans to companies the credit risks of corporate debt securities vary widely among issuers commercial paper commercial paper is an issuers obligation with a maturity of less than nine months companies typically issue commercial paper to pay for current expenditures most issuers constantly reissue their commercial paper and use the proceeds or bank loans to repay maturing paper if the issuer cannot continue to obtain liquidity in this fashion its commercial paper may default the short maturity of commercial paper reduces both the market and credit risks as compared to other debt securities of the same issuer demand instruments demand instruments are corporate debt securities that the issuer must repay upon demand other demand instruments require a third party such as a dealer or bank to repurchase the security for its face value upon demand the fund treats demand instruments as shortterm securities even though their stated maturity may extend beyond one year bank instruments bank instruments are unsecured interest bearing deposits with banks bank instruments include but are not limited to bank accounts time deposits certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances yankee instruments are denominated in us dollars and issued by us branches of foreign banks eurodollar instruments are denominated in us dollars and issued by nonus branches of us or foreign banks for purposes of applying the funds concentration limitation bank instruments also include fixed income securities credit enhanced by a bank asset backed securities asset backed securities are payable from pools of obligations other than mortgages most asset backed securities involve consumer or commercial debts with maturities of less than ten years however almost any type of fixed income assets including other fixed income securities may be used to create an asset backed security asset backed securities may take the form of commercial paper notes or passthrough certificates asset backed securities have prepayment risks zero coupon securities zero coupon securities do not pay interest or principal until final maturity unlike debt securities that provide periodic payments of interest referred to as a coupon payment investors buy zero coupon securities at a price below the amount payable at maturity the difference between the purchase price and the amount paid at maturity represents interest on the zero coupon security investors must wait until maturity to receive interest and principal which increases the interest rate and credit risk of a zero coupon security municipal securities municipal securities are issued by states counties cities and other political subdivisions and authorities mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities represent interests in pools of mortgages the mortgages that comprise a pool normally have similar interest rates maturities and other terms mortgages may have fixed or adjustable interest rates interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as arms callable securities certain fixed income securities in which the fund invests are callable at the option of the issuer callable securities are subject to call risks insurance contracts insurance contracts include guaranteed investment contracts funding agreements and annuities the fund treats these contracts as fixed income securities credit enhancement the fund may invest in securities that have credit enhancement credit enhancement consists of an arrangement in which a company agrees to pay amounts due on a fixed income security if the issuer defaults in some cases the company providing credit enhancement makes all payments directly to the security holders and receives reimbursement from the issuer normally the credit enhancer has greater financial resources and liquidity than the issuer for this reason the adviser usually evaluates the credit risk of a fixed income security based solely upon its credit enhancement common types of credit enhancement include guarantees letters of credit bond insurance and surety bonds credit enhancement also includes arrangements where securities or other liquid assets secure payment of a fixed income security if a default occurs these assets may be sold and the proceeds paid to securitys holders either form of credit enhancement reduces credit risks by providing another source of payment for a fixed income security foreign securities foreign securities are securities of issuers based outside the united states the fund considers an issuer to be based outside the united states if o it is organized under the laws of or has a principal office located in another country o the principal trading market for its securities is in another country or o it or its subsidiaries derived in its most current fiscal year at least  of its total assets capitalization gross revenue or profit from goods produced services performed or sales made in another country along with the risks normally associated with domestic securities of the same type foreign securities are subject to risks of foreign investing the foreign securities in which the fund invests are primarily denominated in us dollars special transactions r interfund borrowing and lending arrangements the securities and exchange commission sec has granted an exemption that permits the fund and all other funds advised by subsidiaries of federated investors inc federated funds to lend and borrow money for certain temporary purposes directly to and from other federated funds participation in this interfund lending program is voluntary for both borrowing and lending federated funds and an interfund loan is only made if it benefits each participating federated fund federated investors inc federated administers the program according to procedures approved by the funds board and the board monitors the operation of the program any interfund loan must comply with certain conditions set out in the exemption which are designed to assure fairness and protect all participating federated funds for example interfund lending is permitted only a to meet shareholder redemption requests and b to meet commitments arising from failed trades all interfund loans must be repaid in seven days or less the funds participation in this program must be consistent with its investment policies and limitations and must meet certain percentage tests interfund loans may be made only when the rate of interest to be charged is more attractive to the lending federated fund than marketcompetitive rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo rate and more attractive to the borrowing federated fund than the rate of interest that would be charged by an unaffiliated bank for shortterm borrowings bank loan rate as determined by the board the interest rate imposed on interfund loans is the average of the repo rate and the bank loan rate r repurchase agreements repurchase agreements are transactions in which the fund buys a security from a dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back at a mutually agreedupon time and price the repurchase price exceeds the sale price reflecting the funds return on the transaction this return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying security the fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as securities dealers deemed creditworthy by the adviser the funds custodian or subcustodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements the adviser or subcustodian will monitor the value of the underlying security each day to ensure that the value of the security always equals or exceeds the repurchase price repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements are repurchase agreements in which the fund is the seller rather than the buyer of the securities and agrees to repurchase them at an agreedupon time and price a reverse repurchase agreement may be viewed as a type of borrowing by the fund reverse repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks in addition reverse repurchase agreements create leverage risks because the fund must repurchase the underlying security at a higher price regardless of the market value of the security at the time of repurchase delayed delivery transactions delayed delivery transactions including whenissued transactions are arrangements in which the fund buys securities for a set price with payment and delivery of the securities scheduled for a future time during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund the fund records the transaction when it agrees to buy the securities and reflects their value in determining the price of its shares settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions so that the market values of the securities bought may vary from the purchase prices therefore delayed delivery transactions create interest rate risks for the fund delayed delivery transactions also involve credit risks in the event of a counterparty default the fund does not intend to engage in delayed delivery transactions to an extent that would cause the segregation of more than  of the total value of its assets asset coverage in order to secure its obligations in connection with special transactions the fund will either own the underlying assets or set aside readily marketable securities with a value that equals or exceeds the funds obligations unless the fund has other readily marketable assets to set aside it cannot trade assets used to secure such obligations without terminating a special transaction this may cause the fund to miss favorable trading opportunities or to realize losses on special transactions investing in securities of other investment companies r the fund may invest its assets in securities of other investment companies including the securities of affiliated money market funds as an efficient means of carrying out its investment policies and managing its uninvested cash these other investment companies are managed independently of the fund and incur additional expenses therefore any such investment by the fund may be subject to duplicate expenses however the adviser believes that the benefits and efficiencies of this approach should outweigh the additional expenses r investment ratings a nationally recognized rating services two highest rating categories are determined without regard for subcategories and gradations for example securities rated a a or a by standard  poors sp prime or prime by moodys investors service moodys or f f or f by fitch ratings fitch are all considered rated in one of the two highest shortterm rating categories the fund will follow applicable regulations in determining whether a security rated by more than one rating service can be treated as being in one of the two highest shortterm rating categories currently such securities must be rated by two rating services in one of their two highest rating categories see regulatory compliance investment risks there are many factors which may affect an investment in the fund the funds principal risks are described in its prospectus additional risk factors are outlined below credit risks credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by failing to pay interest or principal when due if an issuer defaults the fund will lose money many fixed income securities receive credit ratings from services such as sp and moodys these nrsros assign ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood of issuer default lower credit ratings correspond to higher perceived credit risk credit ratings do not provide assurance against default or other loss of money if a security has not received a rating the fund must rely entirely upon the advisers credit assessment fixed income securities generally compensate for greater credit risk by paying interest at a higher rate the difference between the yield of a security and the yield of a us treasury security with a comparable maturity the spread measures the additional interest paid for risk spreads may increase generally in response to adverse economic or market conditions a securitys spread may also increase if the securitys rating is lowered or the security is perceived to have an increased credit risk an increase in the spread will cause the price of the security to decline leverage risks leverage risk is created when an investment exposes the fund to a level of risk that exceeds the amount invested changes in the value of such an investment magnify the funds risk of loss and potential for gain risks of foreign investing foreign securities pose additional risks because foreign economic or political conditions may be less favorable than those of the us securities in foreign markets may also be subject to taxation policies that reduce returns for us investors prepayment risks unlike traditional fixed income securities which pay a fixed rate of interest until maturity when the entire principal amount is due payments on mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities include both interest and a partial payment of principal partial payment of principal may be comprised of scheduled principal payments as well as unscheduled payments from voluntary prepayment refinancing or foreclosure of the underlying loans if the fund receives unscheduled prepayments it may have to reinvest the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates higher credit risks or other less favorable characteristics call risks if a fixed income security is called the fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates higher credit risks or other less favorable characteristics fundamental investment objective and policies the investment objective of the fund is stability of principal and current income consistent with stability of principal money market instruments include but are not limited to us treasury bills all other marketable obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities us government obligations instruments of banks and savings and loans which are members of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic such as certificates of deposit demand and time deposits savings shares and bankers acceptances these instruments are not necessarily guaranteed by the fdic repurchase agreements an instrument where the seller agrees to repurchase the instrument at the time of sale at a mutually agreed upon time and price and prime commercial paper including variable amount demand master notes the fund will not invest in instruments issued by banks or savings and loans unless a at the time of investment they have capital surplus and undivided profits in excess of  as of the date of their most recently published financial statements or b the principal amount of the instrument is insured in full by the fdic to the extent the fund purchases eurodollar certificates of deposit issued by foreign branches of domestic us banks consideration will be given to their domestic marketability the lower reserve requirements normally mandated for overseas banking operations and the possible impact of interruptions in the flow of international currency transactions commercial paper investments will be limited to commercial paper rated a or a by sp prime  or prime  by moodys or f or f by fitch in the case where commercial paper has received different ratings from different services such commercial paper is an acceptable investment so long as at least one rating was a high quality rating and provided the board or its designee determines that such investment presents minimal credit risks the fund may purchase money market instruments including bank instruments and commercial paper which are not rated but are determined by the board or its designee to be of comparable quality to the other bank or corporate obligations in which the fund may invest the fund may also purchase us government obligations on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis although the money market instruments purchased by the fund represent unconditional promises to repay the entire investment proceeds at maturity this in itself does not suggest that the shares of the fund are themselves guaranteed the investment policies outlined above permit investment in a wide variety of money market instruments and it is anticipated that investment emphasis will shift within available categories of instruments depending on the current condition of the money market the fund may attempt to increase yield by trading portfolio securities to take advantage of shortterm market variations the investment objective and policies may not be changed by the funds board without shareholder approval investment limitations diversification of investments with respect to securities comprising  of the value of its total assets the fund will not purchase securities of any one issuer other than cash cash items securities issued or guaranteed by the government of the united states or its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements collateralized by such us government securities and securities of other investment companies if as a result more than  of the value of its total assets would be invested in the securities of that issuer or it would own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer selling short and buying on margin the fund will not purchase any money market instruments on margin or sell any money market instruments short but it may obtain such shortterm credits as may be necessary for clearance of purchases and sales of money market instruments borrowing money the fund will not borrow money except as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency purposes and then only in amounts not in excess of  of the value of its total assets in addition the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements and otherwise borrow up to onethird of the value of its total assets including the amount borrowed in order to meet redemption requests without immediately selling portfolio instruments this latter practice is not for investment leverage but solely to facilitate management of the portfolio by enabling the fund to meet redemption requests when the liquidation of portfolio instruments would be inconvenient or disadvantageous interest paid on borrowed funds will not be available for investment the fund will liquidate any such borrowings as soon as possible however during the period any reverse repurchase agreements are outstanding but only to the extent necessary to assure completion of the reverse repurchase agreements the fund will restrict the purchase of portfolio instruments to money market instruments maturing on or before the expiration date of the reverse repurchase agreements pledging assets the fund will not mortgage pledge or hypothecate any assets except to secure permitted borrowings in those cases it may mortgage pledge or hypothecate assets having a market value not exceeding the lesser of the dollar amounts borrowed or  of the value of total assets at the time of the borrowing underwriting the fund will not underwrite any issue of securities except as it may be deemed to be an underwriter under the securities act of  in connection with the sale of restricted securities which the fund may purchase pursuant to its investment objective policies and limitations lending cash or securities the fund will not lend any of its assets except that it may purchase or hold money market instruments to include repurchase agreements and variable amount demand master notes permitted by the investment objective and policies issuing senior securities the fund will not issue senior securities except as permitted by the investment objective and policies and investment limitations of the fund concentration of investments the fund will not purchase money market instruments if as a result of such purchase more than  of the value of its total assets would be invested in any one industry however investing in bank instruments such as time and demand deposits and certificates of deposit us government obligations or instruments secured by these money market instruments such as repurchase agreements shall not be considered investments in any one industry investing in commodities or real estate the fund will not invest in commodities commodity contracts or real estate except that it may purchase money market instruments issued by companies which invest in or sponsor interests therein the above limitations cannot be changed unless authorized by the board and by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities as defined by the investment company act of   act the following limitations however may be changed by the board without shareholder approval shareholders will be notified before any material change in these limitations becomes effective acquiring securities the fund will not acquire the voting securities of any issuer it will not invest in securities of a company for the purpose of exercising control or management investing in restricted securities the fund may invest in restricted securities restricted securities are any securities that are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities law the fund may invest without limitation in restricted securities which are determined to be liquid under criteria established by the board to the extent that restricted securities are not determined to be liquid the fund will limit their purchase together with other illiquid securities to not more than  of its net assets for purposes of the diversification limitation the fund considers certificates of deposit and demand and time deposits issued by a us branch of a domestic bank or savings association having capital surplus and undivided profits in excess of  at the time of investment to be cash items except with respect to borrowing money if a percentage limitation is adhered to at the time of investment a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from any change in value or net assets will not result in a violation of such limitation regulatory compliance the fund may follow nonfundamental operational policies that are more restrictive than its fundamental investment limitations as set forth in the prospectus and this sai in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations including the provisions of and regulations under the  act in particular the fund will comply with the various requirements of rule a the rule which regulates money market mutual funds the fund will determine the effective maturity of its investments according to the rule the fund may change these operational policies to reflect changes in the laws and regulations without the approval of its shareholders determining market value of securities the board has decided that the best method for determining the value of portfolio instruments is amortized cost under this method portfolio instruments are valued at the acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accumulation of discount rather than at current market value accordingly neither the amount of daily income nor the net asset value nav is affected by any unrealized appreciation or depreciation of the portfolio in periods of declining interest rates the indicated daily yield on shares of the fund computed by dividing the annualized daily income on the funds portfolio by the nav computed as above may tend to be higher than a similar computation made by using a method of valuation based upon market prices and estimates in periods of rising interest rates the opposite may be true the funds use of the amortized cost method of valuing portfolio instruments depends on its compliance with certain conditions in the rule under the rule the board must establish procedures reasonably designed to stabilize the nav per share as computed for purposes of distribution and redemption at  per share taking into account current market conditions and the funds investment objective the procedures include monitoring the relationship between the amortized cost value per share and the nav per share based upon available indications of market value the board will decide what if any steps should be taken if there is a difference of more than  of  between the two values the board will take any steps it considers appropriate such as redemption in kind or shortening the average portfolio maturity to minimize any material dilution or other unfair results arising from differences between the two methods of determining nav trading in foreign securities r trading in foreign securities may be completed at times which vary from the closing of the new york stock exchange nyse in computing its nav the fund

of trustees the board governs the fund the board selects and oversees the adviser passport research ltd the adviser manages the funds assets including buying and selling portfolio securities the adviser is a limited partnership whose general partner is federated investment management company a subsidiary of federated with a  interest the limited partner is edward d jones  co lp with a  interest the partners in the adviser allocate the expenses and revenues of the partnership according to a mutually agreedupon formula last year the general partner received approximately  of the advisers revenues while edward jones received approximately  this allocation may vary depending upon total assets in the fund or other factors edward jones also provides shareholder services administrative services transfer agent services and marketing services to the fund and the  accounts investment shares and  accounts retirement shares that its clients maintain in the fund during the funds last fiscal year edward jones received approximately  million in total approximately  of total fund expenses for its services edward jones would have received  in total fees and payments with respect to a shareholder maintaining an investment of  in investment shares or  with respect to a shareholder maintaining an investment of  in retirement shares during that year as required by the  act the funds board has reviewed the funds investment advisory contract the boards decision to approve the contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements during its review of the contract the board considers many factors among the most material of which are the funds investment objectives and long term performance the advisers management philosophy personnel and processes the preferences and expectations of fund shareholders and their relative sophistication the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry comparable fees in the mutual fund industry the range and quality of services provided to the fund and its shareholders by the federated organization in addition to investment advisory services and the funds relationship to the federated funds in assessing the advisers performance of its obligations the board also considers whether there has occurred a circumstance or event that would constitute a reason for it to not renew an advisory contract in this regard the board is mindful of the potential disruptions of the funds operations and various risks uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract in particular the board recognizes that most shareholders have invested in the fund on the strength of the advisers industry standing and reputation and in the expectation that the adviser will have a continuing role in providing advisory services to the fund the board also considers the compensation and benefits received by the adviser this includes fees received for services provided to the fund by other entities in the federated organization and research services received by the adviser from brokers that execute fund trades as well as advisory fees in this regard the board is aware that various courts have interpreted provisions of the  act and have indicated in their decisions that the following factors may be relevant to an advisers compensation the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser including the performance of the fund the advisers cost of providing the services the extent to which the adviser may realize economies of scale as the fund grows larger any indirect benefits that may accrue to the adviser and its affiliates as a result of the advisers relationship with the fund performance and expenses of comparable funds and the extent to which the independent board members are fully informed about all facts bearing on the advisers service and fee the funds board is aware of these factors and takes them into account in its review of the funds advisory contract the board considers and weighs these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated experience in governing the fund and working with federated on matters relating to the federated funds and is assisted in its deliberations by the advice of independent legal counsel in this regard the board requests and receives a significant amount of information about the fund and the federated organization federated provides much of this information at each regular meeting of the board and furnishes additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the boards formal review of the advisory contracts occurs in between regularly scheduled meetings the board may receive information on particular matters as the need arises thus the boards evaluation of an advisory contract is informed by reports covering such matters as the advisers investment philosophy personnel and processes the funds short and longterm performance in absolute terms as well as in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or peer group funds and comments on the reasons for performance the funds expenses including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of the fund both in absolute terms and relative to similar andor competing funds with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations the use and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the funds portfolio securities the nature and extent of the advisory and other services provided to the fund by the adviser and its affiliates compliance and audit reports concerning the federated funds and the federated companies that service them and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how the federated funds andor federated are responding to them the board also receives financial information about federated including reports on the compensation and benefits federated derives from its relationships with the federated funds these reports cover not only the fees under the advisory contracts but also fees received by federateds subsidiaries for providing other services to the federated funds under separate contracts eg for serving as the federated funds administrator the reports also discuss any indirect benefit federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute federated fund trades the board bases its decision to approve an advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances and relevant factors and with a view to past and future longterm considerations not all of the factors and considerations identified above are relevant to every federated fund nor does the board consider any one of them to be determinative because the totality of circumstances includes considering the relationship of each federated fund the board does not approach consideration of every federated funds advisory contract as if that were the only federated fund services agreement federated advisory services company an affiliate of the adviser provides certain support services to the adviser the fee for these services is paid by the adviser and not by the fund other related services affiliates of the adviser may from time to time provide certain electronic equipment and software to institutional customers in order to facilitate the purchase of fund shares offered by the distributor r code of ethics restrictions on personal trading as required by sec rules the fund its adviser and its distributor have adopted codes of ethics these codes govern securities trading activities of investment personnel fund trustees and certain other employees although they do permit these people to trade in securities including those that the fund could buy as well as shares of the fund they also contain significant safeguards designed to protect the fund and its shareholders from abuses in this area such as requirements to obtain prior approval for and to report particular transactions r voting proxies on fund portfolio securities the board has delegated to the adviser authority to vote proxies on the securities held in the funds portfolio the board has also approved the advisers policies and procedures for voting the proxies which are described below proxy voting policies the advisers general policy is to cast proxy votes in favor of proposals that the adviser anticipates will enhance the longterm value of the securities being voted generally this will mean voting for proposals that the adviser believes will improve the management of a company increase the rights or preferences of the voted securities andor increase the chance that a premium offer would be made for the company or for the voted securities the following examples illustrate how these general policies may apply to proposals submitted by a companys board of directors however whether the adviser supports or opposes a proposal will always depend on the specific circumstances described in the proxy statement and other available information on matters of corporate governance generally the adviser will vote for proposals to require independent tabulation of proxies andor confidential voting by shareholders reorganize in another jurisdiction unless it would reduce the rights or preferences of the securities being voted and repeal a shareholder rights plan also known as a poison pill the adviser will generally vote against the adoption of such a plan unless the plan is designed to facilitate rather than prevent unsolicited offers for the company on matters of capital structure generally the adviser will vote against proposals to authorize or issue shares that are senior in priority or voting rights to the securities being voted for proposals to grant preemptive rights to the securities being voted and against proposals to eliminate such preemptive rights on matters relating to management compensation generally the adviser will vote for stock incentive plans that align the recipients interests with the interests of shareholders without creating undue dilution and against proposals that would permit the amendment or replacement of outstanding stock incentives with new stock incentives having more favorable terms on matters relating to corporate transactions the adviser will vote proxies relating to proposed mergers capital reorganizations and similar transactions in accordance with the general policy based upon its analysis of the proposed transaction the adviser will vote proxies in contested elections of directors in accordance with the general policy based upon its analysis of the opposing slates and their respective proposed business strategies some transactions may also involve proposed changes to the companys corporate governance capital structure or management compensation the adviser will vote on such changes based on its evaluation of the proposed transaction or contested election in these circumstances the adviser may vote in a manner contrary to the general practice for similar proposals made outside the context of such a proposed transaction or change in the board for example if the adviser decides to vote against a proposed transaction it may vote for antitakeover measures reasonably designed to prevent the transaction even though the adviser typically votes against such measures in other contexts the adviser generally votes against proposals submitted by shareholders without the favorable recommendation of a companys board the adviser believes that a companys board should manage its business and policies and that shareholders who seek specific changes should strive to convince the board of their merits or seek direct representation on the board in addition the adviser will not vote if it determines that the consequences or costs outweigh the potential benefit of voting for example if a foreign market requires shareholders casting proxies to retain the voted shares until the meeting date thereby rendering the shares illiquid for some period of time the adviser will not vote proxies for such shares proxy voting procedures the adviser has established a proxy voting committee proxy committee to exercise all voting discretion granted to the adviser by the board in accordance with the proxy voting policies the adviser has hired investor responsibility research center irrc to obtain vote and record proxies in accordance with the proxy committees directions the proxy committee directs irrc by means of proxy voting guidelines and irrc may vote any proxy as directed in the proxy voting guidelines without further direction from the proxy committee and may make any determinations required to implement the proxy voting guidelines however if the proxy voting guidelines require casebycase direction for a proposal irrc will provide the proxy committee with all information that it has obtained regarding the proposal and the proxy committee will provide specific direction to irrc the advisers proxy voting procedures generally permit the proxy committee to amend the proxy voting guidelines or override the directions provided in such guidelines whenever necessary to comply with the proxy voting policies conflicts of interest the adviser has adopted procedures to address situations where a matter on which a proxy is sought may present a potential conflict between the interests of the fund and its shareholders and those of the adviser or distributor this may occur where a significant business relationship exists between the adviser or its affiliates and a company involved with a proxy vote a company that is a proponent opponent or the subject of a proxy vote and which to the knowledge of the proxy committee has this type of significant business relationship is referred to as an interested company the adviser has implemented the following procedures in order to avoid concerns that the conflicting interests of the adviser have influenced proxy votes any employee of the adviser who is contacted by an interested company regarding proxies to be voted by the adviser must refer the interested company to a member of the proxy committee and must inform the interested company that the proxy committee has exclusive authority to determine how the adviser will vote any proxy committee member contacted by an interested company must report it to the full proxy committee and provide a written summary of the communication under no circumstances will the proxy committee or any member of the proxy committee make a commitment to an interested company regarding the voting of proxies or disclose to an interested company how the proxy committee has directed such proxies to be voted if the proxy voting guidelines already provide specific direction on the proposal in question the proxy committee shall not alter or amend such directions if the proxy voting guidelines require the proxy committee to provide further direction the proxy committee shall do so in accordance with the proxy voting policies without regard for the interests of the adviser with respect to the interested company if the proxy committee provides any direction as to the voting of proxies relating to a proposal affecting an interested company it must disclose to the funds board information regarding the significant business relationship any material communication with the interested company the matters voted on and how and why the adviser voted as it did if the fund holds shares of another investment company for which the adviser or an affiliate acts as an investment adviser the proxy committee will vote the funds proxies in the same proportion as the votes cast by shareholders who are not clients of the adviser at any shareholders meeting called by such investment company unless otherwise directed by the board
