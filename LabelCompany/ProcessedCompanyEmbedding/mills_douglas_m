judge  plaintiff douglas m mills mills appeals the district courts grant of summary judgment to health care service corporation hcsc in his title vii gender discrimination suit the district court found that mills was unable to prove that hcscs proffered reasons for failing to promote him were pretextual for the reasons set out below we affirm the trial courts decision background  we give a brief outline of the facts here and will discuss them in greater detail where relevant to our analysis hcsc is a health care claims processing company with offices throughout illinois the plaintiff worked in a variety of divisions and positions at hcscs quincy office starting in  in general mills received favorable work reviews  in  a comanager of the quincy office sandy frillman resigned leaving linda amburn as the offices sole manager in response to frillmans departure the company created a new assistant manager position which amburn was responsible for filling when the company posted the minimum requirements for the position four individuals applied for the job teri provine kathy cluver darlene butler and the plaintiff after butler and the plaintiff were interviewed amburn offered the position to butler the plaintiff citing his own qualifications which he alleged were better than butlers sued claiming gender discrimination the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant bringing us to this appeal analysis  we review the trial courts decision de novo drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving partyhere the plaintiff biolchini v general electric co  fd   th cir  only if there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute is summary judgment appropriate anderson v liberty lobby  us    s ct   l ed d   in employment discrimination cases we apply this standard with added rigor before granting summary judgment sarsha v sears roebuck  co  fd   th cir a  plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases can avert summary judgment in one of two ways first they can present direct evidence showing discriminatory intent by the defendant or its agents troupe v may dept stores  fd   th cir a direct evidence assertion must be supported by allegations which if believed by the trier of fact will prove the particular fact in question without reliance upon inference or presumption eiland v trinity hospital  fd   th cir citations omitted  second plaintiffs may offer indirect evidence that they have been discriminated against this takes the form of the familiar three part burden shifting test established in mcdonnell douglas corp v green  us   s ct   l ed d   and refined in texas dept of community affairs v burdine  us   s ct   l ed d   the mcdonnell douglas test requires that a plaintiff establish a prima facie case satisfied by showing that the plaintiff  is a member of a protected minority class or a female  applied for and was qualified for an open position  was rejected and  the employer filled the position with a person not in the plaintiffs protected class or the position remained open eeoc v our lady of the resurrection med ctr  fd   th cir if the plaintiff establishes these elements the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its employment action should the defendant meet its burden the plaintiff then must cast doubt on whether these reasons are credible or whether they are merely pretext courtney v biosound inc  fd   th cir b   initially we must determine whether this plaintiff meets the requirements of the prima facie test because douglas mills is a white male he clearly does not satisfy prong one indeed if strictly applied the prima facie test would eliminate all reverse discrimination suits however the test is not so inflexibleit is well settled law that the protections of title vii are not limited to members of historically discriminatedagainst groups mcdonald v santa fe trail transp co  us    s ct   l ed d   greenslade v chicago suntimes inc  fd   th cir hill v burrell communications grp inc  fd   th cir  what is less settled is how to apply the traditional prima facie test to this situation one option is to simply drop the first prong on the other hand at least two circuits use a different standard in reverse discrimination cases see taken v oklahoma corp commn  fd   th cir harding v gray  fd   dccir those cases operate from the premise that invidious discrimination against white men is relatively uncommon in our society and so there is nothing inherently suspicious in an employers decision to promote a qualified minority or female applicant instead of a qualified white male applicant harding  fd at  this approach has also been justified because the presumption that arises once the mcdonnell douglas prima facie test is metthat unless otherwise explained discrimination is more likely than not the reason for the challenged decisionis not necessarily justified when the plaintiff is a member of an historically favored group notari v denver water dept  fd   th cir  thus these circuits have modified the prima facie test and added various substitutes referred to as background circumstances for the burden imposed on minority or women plaintiffs to show that they are members of a protected class harding  fd at  the contours of what constitutes a background circumstance are not precise in harding the dc circuit enumerated two categories of circumstances evidence indicating that the particular employer at issue has some reason or inclination to discriminate invidiously against whites or men and evidence indicating that there is something fishy about the facts of the case at hand id citations omitted plaintiffs in that circuit have shown something was fishy when they presented evidence of schemes to fix performance ratings to their detriment that the hiring system seemed rigged against them because it departed from the usual procedures in an unprecedented fashion or that they were passed over despite superior qualifications id at  citations omitted another court applying a variant of the mcdonnell douglas test in a reverse discrimination bivens action held that background circumstances could include situations in which the person ultimately hired was clearly less qualified than the plaintiff the hiring authority expressed intense interest in hiring a woman and there was a pattern of hiring women in the past duffy v wolle  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   additionally in reynolds v school dist no  denver colorado the plaintiff successfully showed background circumstances where she was the only white employee in the department and nearly all of the decision makers were hispanic  fd   th cir all of these background circumstances support an inference that the defendant is one of those unusual employers who discriminates against the majority thus shifting the burden to the defendant to articulate a legitimate reason for its hiring decision taken v oklahoma corp commn  fd    these approaches are not meant to foreclose pursuit of legitimate title vii claims by white men harding  fd at  background circumstances not an additional hurdle but rather a substitute for minority plaintiffs burden under first prong of mcdonnell douglas test nothing in the modified prima facie formulations alters the fact that a majority plaintiff can always use direct evidence of prohibited discrimination to defeat a summary judgment motion id moreover if a plaintiff fails to make a prima facie case under the modified test he can demonstrate illegal discrimination by any other indirect evidence sufficient to support a reasonable probability  that but for his status as a white male the challenged employment decision would not have occurred taken  fd at  quoting notari  fd at  regardless of race an employee who is the victim of intentional discrimination who adduces sufficient evidence of that discrimination should be permitted to proceed beyond the prima facie stage of litigation see also duffy  fd at  just because a reverse discrimination plaintiff cannot show background circumstances  does not inexorably mean that his employer has not intentionally discriminated against him and if that employee has evidence of discrimination he should be permitted to shift the burden to the defendant to prove a legitimate reason for the challenged employment decision  the defendant hcsc asks us to adopt one of these modified forms of the prima facie test this court has never actually decided whether doing so is appropriate some of our opinions have noted the need for modifications to the mcdonnell douglas test kirk v board of educ of bremen community hs dist no   fd   n  th cir noting in dicta at a minimum it seems that some modification of the minority group circumstance is necessary in a reverse discrimination case murray v thistledown racing club inc  fd  th cir see also ustrak v fairman  fd   th cir mcdonnell douglas framework designed to protect women and minorities not whites and christensen v equitable life assur soc of us  fd   th cir discussing distinction between using mcdonnell douglas paradigm to show discrimination against the minority as opposed to the majority  however in cases where we have had the opportunity to formally adopt the test we have not taken that step in hill v burrell communications grp inc  fd  th cir we assumed that the ordinary standard applied because it was never meant to be applied rigidly  fd at  we observed that we could not discern any reason for applying one formula for the allocation of burdens of production in discrimination cases involving minorities and a different formula in reverse discrimination cases id at  n  nevertheless we declined to resolve the question of the appropriate standard id see also pilditch v board of educ of city of chicago  fd   n  th cir  we think that it is now appropriate to answer this question we agree with much of the analysis in murray hill and notari which operates from the presumption that it is the unusual employer who discriminates against majority employees we also believe that if majority plaintiffs have to show less to prove their prima facie burden than minorities who have historically suffered the type of discrimination title vii sought to prevent employers lose the screening out benefits that the prima facie test was intended to provide see jayasinghe v bethlehem steel corp  fd   th cir prima facie test serves to screen out cases where the plaintiff fails to distinguish his or her case from the ordinary legitimate kind of adverse personnel decision thus a plaintiff in a reverse discrimination case must show at least one of the background circumstances these other courts have alluded to we note however that this modified test is not to be interpreted in a constricting fashion it in no way precludes any plaintiff with direct evidence of discrimination from bringing his claim moreover if a plaintiff cannot show background circumstances but has established a logical reason to believe that the employers decision rests on a legally forbidden ground such as his race or gender he may shift the burden to the defendant to prove that the challenged employment action was actually based on legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons see carson v bethlehem steel corp  fd  th cir per curiam   now that the nature of the prima facie test is properly defined we must determine whether mills can meet the four prongs the defendant does not dispute prongs two three and four it is clear that mills met the minimum qualifications for the position of associate manager he was not hired and a woman darlene butler was selected for the job the only question is whether the plaintiff can show any background circumstances which give rise to an inference of discrimination the defendant asserts that because mills cannot demonstrate that his qualifications were clearly superior to butlers the plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case  this is too narrow a view of background circumstances while hcscs contention is true mills can pursue other avenues in support of his claim mills points to disproportionate hiring patterns favoring women at hcscs quincy office between  nearly all promotions at the office went to women and at the time the challenged hiring decision was made females dominated the supervisory positions in the relevant office as other cases have held these facts while far from actual evidence of discrimination are enough to overcome the background presumption that a white man was not subject to employment discrimination reynolds v school dist no  denver colorado  fd   th cir daye v harris  fd   dccir thus the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision to hire butler instead of mills c  hcsc offers just such reasons in defense of its decision to hire butler instead of mills the company avers that butler had clearly superior qualifications to mills and was a better fit for the position of associate manager  regarding the superior qualifications hcsc notes that while the two candidates have comparable business degrees butler had an additional associates degree in computer science the defendant also points to linda amburns belief that butler had superior qualifications in the areas of creativity flexibility innovativeness interpersonal skills leadership qualities communications skills teamwork and product knowledge these beliefs were culled from both oral and written interviews amburn testified in depositions that she was more impressed with butlers style and content in both types of interviews in particular she pointed to answers to a written interview question asking the candidates to propose structural changes in the office and the fact that in the oral interview butler smiled more than mills who did not appear very happy and had a stern countenance  amburn also believed that the breadth of butlers experience was greater than the plaintiffs because although they had both been at hcsc for eight years butler had worked her way up to supervisor while mills remained in the same position throughout additionally amburn pointed to butlers success as an inquiry supervisor a position amburn believed was one of the most important and difficult at the company although mills had some experience as an inquiry supervisor his tenure was for a shorter duration and apparently less successful finally hcsc presents other reasons to buttress its contentions however because these reasons are peripheral to its central contention that it made its decision based on butlers superior qualifications and we need not address them d  once an employer articulates legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the employees termination the employee must present enough evidence to support a finding that the stated reasons are pretextual wolf v buss america inc  fd   th cir because a title vii claim requires intentional discrimination the pretext inquiry focuses on whether the employers stated reason was honest not whether it was accurate helland v south bend community sch corp  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   in short mills has the burden of showing that hcscs reasons for hiring butler were either lies see russell v acmeevans co  fd   th cir or had no basis in fact see johnson v city of fort wayne  fd   th cir  as mills correctly contends at summary judgment the plaintiff is not required to establish pretext and provide evidence of a discriminatory motive by the defendant as the district court mistakenly apprehended this level of proof is only required when a plaintiffs case is submitted to a finder of fact st marys honor center v hicks  us    s ct   l ed d   the plaintiff who survives summary judgment and goes to trial may be well advised to present additional evidence of discrimination beyond pretext because the factfinder is not required to find in the plaintiffs favor simply because she establishes a prima facie case and shows that the employers proffered reasons are false anderson v baxter healthcare corp  fd   th cir emphasis omitted citation omitted however as we have held for a plaintiff to prevail on a defendants motion for summary judgment he need not show pretext plus and he must only produce evidence from which a rational trier of fact could infer that the company lied about its proffered reasons for his dismissal  if an inference of improper motive can be drawn there must be a trial id emphasis omitted citations omitted see also loyd v phillips bros inc  fd   th cir  mills argues that the decision to promote butler because she was better qualified for the position is suspect for several reasons first he contends that hcscs reliance on butlers background as an inquiry supervisor is pretextual this is pretext according to mills because his performance in the same role was well above average and he was highly effective in that position this is hardly persuasive evidence of pretext because even if hcsc was mistaken in evaluating the plaintiffs qualifications mills does not show that this evaluation was not honestly undertaken lenoir v roll coater inc  fd   th cir the only exception to this would be where the employers evaluation was so egregiously mistaken that it had no basis in fact kaniff v allstate ins co  fd   th cir but this is far from that case more persuasive is the plaintiffs allegation that the companys contention that experience in the inquiry unit was an important factor in its decision is pretext as mills argues two women who were previously promoted over him into assistant manager positions had no background at all in this area while he had significant experience in this field on summary judgment where we must draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor we agree with him that this appears odd  even if this created a genuine issue of material fact about whether using inquiry unit experience was pretextual although we are not convinced that it does it would provide mills with little succor because the defendant offered multiple reasons for its decision mills must show that all were pretextual in order to reverse the district courts grant of summary judgment wolf v buss america inc  fd   th cir he cannot show that the reams of evidence including appraisals of past experience written evaluations and the results of oral interviews were anything other than hcscs honest opinion of which employee was a better fit for the assistant manager position in the absence of such a showing even if these evaluations were wrong we do not sit as a superpersonnel department with plenary authority to review hcscs business decisions debs v northeastern illinois university  fd   th cir  mills tries a different tack in arguing that hcscs failure to articulate consistent reasons for the decision to hire butler establish pretext immediately following the plaintiffs interview with linda amburn she prepared an evaluation of him ranking him in ten categories and included written comments on a  to  scale with  being the worst mills received two s below average six s average and one  above average in the written section amburn observed that she did not believe that assistant manager was truly the position that mills sought mills avers that this is inconsistent with what amburn told him at a meeting on august  two weeks after butler was hired when amburn did not pinpoint any specific deficiencies in his performance and failed to identify areas where he needed improvement he also alleges these reasons do not comport with the superior qualifications rational asserted in this case mills asks us to draw an inference that a genuine issue exists as to whether these inconsistencies comprise pretext  the district court did not draw such an inference it observed that amburn might not have told mills about his performance deficiencies at the meeting because she did not want to embarrass the plaintiff or she might not have wanted to talk about the matter however since mills was the nonmoving party on summary judgment it was improper for the district court to draw such inferences in the defendants favor on the other hand while any inferences drawn from the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only reasonable inferences need be made felce v fiedler  fd   th cir particularly because mills conceded that the purpose of the meeting with amburn was not to find out the reasons why butler was promoted but instead to ascertain what he could to improve his chances in the future we believe that this evidence is a wash and is not inconsistent with what was said on any other occasions additionally we see no inconsistencies between the plaintiffs low scores on his interview evaluation and hcscs proffered reason that it hired butler because she had superior qualifications drawing an inference of pretext from this evidence would be unreasonable  reviewing all of the evidence we find that the plaintiff cannot show that the reasons hcsc proffered for hiring darlene butler over him were pretextual conclusion  although we disagree with part of the district courts analysis its ultimate conclusion was correct accordingly the grant of summary judgment to the defendant is  affirmed  in certain circumstances a plaintiff need not prove this fourth prong carson v bethlehem steel corp  fd  th cir per curiam carson held that an employee may be able to show that his race or another characteristic that the law places off limits tipped the scales against him without regard to the demographic characteristics of his replacement id at  speaking to the point of whether the fact that ones replacement is of another race sex or age we observed this may help to raise an inference of discrimination but it is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition of proving a title vii case id citations omitted outside the parameters of the fourpronged prima facie test the plaintiff may shift the burden if he has established a logical reason to believe that the employers decision rests on a legally forbidden ground id  the sixth circuit has adopted a similar test in murray v thistledown racing club inc  fd   th cir and has continued to use it in recent unpublished orders however the test is the subject of intracircuit controversy and was criticized but not overruled in pierce v commonwealth life ins co  fd   th cir also as we note below the eighth circuit has adopted a variant of the test in a bivens action against the federal government but not in a title vii suit yet see footnote four  because the eighth circuits decision was not in a title vii case we do not include it with the other circuits that have explicitly opted for a modified prima facie test even though duffy adopted much of notaris reasoning  fd at   some of this circuits district courts have adopted and actually used modified tests in reverse discrimination cases see murphy v milwaukee area tech coll  f supp  edwis court found harding and notari persuasive and will use the background circumstances element in determining whether or not the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of reverse discrimination see also opatka v menasha corp  f supp   edwis jones v slater steels corp  f supp   ndind the proof required in the prima facie stage of the test must be modified to reflect the fact that the majority rather than the minority is the object of discrimination  this is not the first presumption we have engaged in the discrimination context in chiaramonte v fashion bed grp inc we applied the common actor presumption which raises a strong but not insurmountable presumption of nondiscrimination  fd   th cir this presumption arises when a member of a protected class is hired and fired by the identical person within a relatively short time period there applying common sense we observed it is highly doubtful that a person who hires an employee in a protected age group  would fire that same employee less than two years after the retention as a result of a sudden aversion to older people  id citations omitted see also eeoc v our lady of the resurrection med ctr  fd   th cir  plaintiff also presents evidence of hcscs past hiring practices to show circumstantial evidence of discrimination while this evidence was relevant to millss ability to establish his prima facie case in the context of discrediting the defendants
