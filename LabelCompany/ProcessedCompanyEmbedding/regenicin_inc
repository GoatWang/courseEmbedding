  investor relations management team board of directors faq news releases stock information sec filings investor relations overview regenicin inc is an earlystage biotechnology company specializing in the development of regenerative cell therapies for wound care and tissue regeneration regenicins lead product is novaderm® a cultured cell technology that uses a small full thickness biopsy of the patients skin that can be grown in the laboratory to generate new living skin for grafting large areas of the patient in cases where there is insufficient healthy skin to cover the damaged areas wounds ulcers or thermal electrical or chemical burns this approach is intended to reduce the chances of patient immune rejection by using autologous grafts that can connect to the blood supply and continue to regenerate and grow like normal skin in addition novaderm is intended to provide physicians and patients with a new safer approach to skin regeneration by using technologies that can protect the patient from external pathogens that might be found in traditional collagenbased products investment highlights tissue engineering and cell therapy represents a market that is expected to grow from  billion in  to almost  billion by  in the us alone according to medmarket diligence the rapid growth has been attributed primarily to demonstrable clinical benefits a clearly defined regulatory path and a readiness by clinicians to adopt products for use regenicin is well positioned to become a leader in one of the fastest growing industries in biotechnology product candidatenovaderm is being developed as regenerative cell therapy that can regrow a patients own skin by harvesting fibroblast and keratinocytes from full thickness skin biopsy that is a small fraction of the size of the damaged area of skin novaderm is composed of both epidermal outer skin and dermal inner skin layers with an autologous extracellular matrix the cell culturing process followed by meshing can provide enough autologous skin to graft an area up to  times larger than the initial biopsy novaderm when grafted is not just a dermis and epidermis from the patients own cells but also contains collagen produced by the patients own fibroblast during culturing the autologous fibroblast produce reticular and elastic fibers that make up the extracellular matrix novaderm is currently being validated to test the companys new process and approach to developing novaderm with its unique collagen matrix novaderm is expected to be the only cultured skin substitute to not be designated with a drug component by the us food and drug administration fda for treating burn victims with total burned surface areas greater than  novaderm is being developed to ensure the cultured skin substitute is available when the patient needs it novaderm may be available for grafting in less than a month and with a shelf life longer than a week collagen safety as antibiotic resistance is on the rise and superbugs are none responsive to the current antibiotics on the market it is more important now than in any other time in history to take the proper precautions to protect our population from pathogens collagen is a protein that is naturally produced in the bodies of animals especially mammals and is the main component of connective tissues like cartilage novaderm like other regenerative skin candidates in development are built on collagen scaffolds most of the collagen supply comes from animals of unknown origins or medical history a large amount of animal components destined for medical use are imported from foreign countries like china for which the fda has no authority before the abattoir currently the majority of animal components are collected from slaughter houses which do not have the traceability or adequate controls to prevent the use of animal components contaminated with pathogens the controls used for food are not adequate for materials that are going to be used for medical products however since the  heparin crisis where large amounts of heparin was found to be contaminated contributing to the deaths of patients additional testing procedures were put into place to prevent it from happening again the fda and other regulatory bodies have established regulations to mitigate the risk of pathogens being transplanted into humans those regulations have yet to be enforced in an effort to find safe collagen supplies within the us and abroad regenicin is identifying and will only enter into exclusive agreements with suppliers that only produce collagen from closed herds a closed herd has an advantage in that the animals within the herd are no longer being exposed to potential carriers of diseases or parasites brought in from outside the herd in fact each source of collagen can be traced back to a specific certified animal its health its food supply and more in broad terms closed herd animal products ensures that controls have been put into place to prevent exposure of the parents and grandparents of the closed herd animal the entire life of the harvested animal a dedicated facility to harvest the materials and traceability through cgmp manufacturers and the use by the patient novaderm is intended to be the first product of its kind to use a collagen matrix produced exceeding international and fda closed herd regulations novaderms collagen scaffold has the traceability required for xenotranspant materials novaderm is processed to mitigate the risk of contamination of unwanted pathogens in every step of the process technology and manufacturingnovaderm and related product candidates will be produced a cgmp facility ensuring safety and efficacy a small full thickness biopsy of the patients skin can be expanded to cover  times its area in as little as  days selftoself skin grafts form skin tissue that is not rejected by the immune system of the patient which is a critical possibility in porcine or cadaver skin grafts used today commercializationthe technology for novaderm has been developed by studying the development of skin substitutes over the last  years the skin substitute technologies that are the basis of the novaderm product have been clinically tested in numerous fda sanctioned clinical trials by various companies integra dermal regeneration template apligraft and dermagraft all similar temporary skin substitute technologies have been approved by the fda novaderm® is the only permanent autogolus cultured skin substitute designed to be available for the patient within  days of acquiring the harvest skin used to culture novaderm® the american medical association has assigned cpt current procedural terminology code for cultured skin substitutes under the dermal substitute category which enables insurance companies to process and hospitals to be reimbursed for cultured skin substitutes once approved by the fda  regenicin all rights reserved welcome to regenicin
