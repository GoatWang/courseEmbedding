branch offices only after approval by the pennsylvania department of banking and securities and the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” approval by these regulators can be subject to a variety of factors including the convenience and needs of the community whether the institution is sufficiently capitalized and well managed issues of safety and soundness the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community whether there are significant supervisory concerns with respect to the institution or affiliated organizations and whether any financial or other business arrangement direct or indirect involving bank “insiders” directors officers employees and orgreater shareholders which involves terms and conditions more

minimum capital requirements on october   pennsylvania enacted three laws known as the “banking law modernization package” all of which became effective on december   the intended goal of the law which applies to customers bank is to modernize pennsylvania’s banking laws and to reduce regulatory burden at the state level where possible given the increased regulatory demands at the federal level as described below the law also permits banks to disclose formal enforcement actions initiated by the pennsylvania department of banking and securities clarifies that the department has examination and enforcement authority over subsidiaries as well as affiliates of regulated banks and bolsters the department’s enforcement authority over its regulated institutions by clarifying its ability to remove directors officers and employees from institutions for violations of laws or orders or for any unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty changes to existing law also allow the department to assess civil money penalties of up to  per violation the law also sets a new standard of care for bank officers and directors applying the same standard that exists for nonbanking corporations in pennsylvania the standard is one of performing duties in good faith in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the institutions and with such care including reasonable inquiry skill and diligence as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances directors may rely in good faith on information opinions and reports provided by officers employees attorneys accountants or committees of the board and an officer may not be held liable simply because he or she served as an officer of the institution interstate branching  federal

 banking regulators in the states of new jersey new york and pennsylvania entered into a memorandum of understanding the “interstate mou” to clarify their respective roles as home and host state regulators regarding interstate branching activity on a regional basis pursuant to the riegleneal amendments act of  the interstate mou establishes the regulatory responsibilities of the respective state banking regulators regarding bank regulatory examinations and is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on statechartered banks branching within the region by eliminating duplicative host state compliance exams under the interstate mou the activities of branches customers established in new jersey or new york would be governed by pennsylvania state law to the same extent that federal law governs the activities of the branch of an outofstate national bank in such host states issues regarding whether a particular host state law is preempted are to be determined in the first instance by the pennsylvania department of banking and securities in the event that the pennsylvania department of banking and securities and the applicable host state regulator disagree regarding whether a particular host state law is preempted the pennsylvania department of banking and securities and the applicable host state regulator would use their reasonable best efforts to consider all points of view and to resolve the disagreement federal banking laws interstate branching  the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  called the “interstate act” among other things permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state a bank may also merge with a bank in another state interstate acquisitions and mergers are subject in general to certain concentration limits and state entry rules relating to the age of the bank under the interstate act the responsible federal regulatory agency is permitted to approve the acquisition of less than all of the branches of an insured bank by an outofstate bank or bank holding company without the acquisition of an entire bank only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits under the interstate act branches of statechartered banks that operate in other states are covered by the laws of the chartering state rather than the host state the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” created a more permissive interstate branching regime by permitting banks to establish branches de novo in any state if a bank chartered by such state would have been permitted to establish the branch for more information on interstate branching under pennsylvania law see “pennsylvania banking laws – interstate branching” above prompt corrective action  federal banking law mandates certain “prompt corrective actions” which federal banking agencies are required to take and certain actions which they have discretion to take based upon the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls regulations have been adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies setting forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized under the rules an institution will be deemed to be “adequately capitalized” or better if it exceeds the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements however it will be deemed “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a common equity tier  riskbased capital ratio that is less than  or has a total riskbased capital ratio that is less than  a tier  riskbased capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage ratio that is less than  and “critically undercapitalized” if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than  the rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party in addition an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain restrictions including a prohibition on the payment of dividends a limitation on asset growth and expansion and in certain cases a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers and a prohibition on the payment of certain “management fees” to any “controlling person”  institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring a limitation on the institution’s ability to make acquisitions open new branch offices or engage in new lines of business obligations to raise additional capital restrictions on transactions with affiliates and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits in certain cases bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser if an institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” and continues in that category for four quarters the statute requires with certain narrowly limited exceptions that the institution be placed in receivership  table of contents safety and soundness regulation of bank management  the federal reserve board possesses the power to prohibit a bank from engaging in any activity that would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and in violation of the law moreover federal law enactments have expanded the circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institution’s federal supervisory agency restricted and further regulated lending by a bank to its executive officers directors principal shareholders or related interests thereof restricted management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions with certain depository institutions whose assets exceed a specified amount or which have an office within a specified geographic area and restricted management personnel from borrowing from another institution that has a correspondent relationship with the bank for which they work capital rules  federal banking agencies have issued certain “riskbased capital” guidelines which supplemented existing capital requirements in addition the federal reserve board imposes certain “leverage” requirements on member banks banking regulators have authority to require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual bank or bank holding company in view of its circumstances the riskbased capital guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain capital levels in compliance with “riskbased capital” ratios in these ratios the onbalance sheet assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned a riskweight based upon the perceived and historical risk of incurring a loss of principal from that exposure the riskbased capital rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets the riskbased capital rules also may consider interest rate risk institutions with interest rate risk exposure above a normal level would be required to hold extra capital in proportion to that risk the bank currently monitors and manages its assets and liabilities for interest rate risk and management believes that the interest rate risk rules which have been implemented and proposed will not materially adversely affect its operations the federal reserve board’s “leverage” ratio rules require member banks which are rated the highest in the composite areas of capital asset quality management earnings and liquidity to maintain a ratio of “tier ” capital to “adjusted total assets” of not less than  for banks which are not the most highly rated the minimum “leverage” ratio will range from  to  or higher at the discretion of the federal reserve board and is required to be at a level commensurate with the nature of the level of risk of the bancorps condition and activities for purposes of the capital requirements “tier ” or “core” capital is defined to include common shareholders’ equity and certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus “tier ” or “qualifying supplementary” capital is defined to include a bank’s allowance for loan losses up to  of riskweighted assets plus certain types of preferred stock and related surplus certain “hybrid capital instruments” and certain term subordinated debt instruments new capital rules on july   the federal reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory riskbased capital rules applicable to the bancorp and the bank the fdic and the occ have subsequently approved these rules the final rules were adopted following the issuance of proposed rules by the federal reserve in june  and implement the “basel iii” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the doddfrank act “basel iii” refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision in december  the rules text released in december  and loss absorbency rules issued in january  which include significant changes to bank capital leverage and liquidity requirements the rules include new riskbased capital and leverage ratios planned to be phased in from  to  and refine the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios effective january   the new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the bancorp and the bank under the final rules were i a common equity tier  riskbased capital ratio of  ii a

discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer the “countercyclical buffer” of up to  of common equity tier  capital to take into account the macrofinancial environment and periods of excessive credit growth however the final rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to “advanced approach banks” ie banks with  billion or more in total assets or  billion or more in total foreign exposures which currently excludes the bancorp and the bank the final rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with basel iii regarding the various components of tier  capital including common equity unrealized gains and losses as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as tier  capital some of which will be phased out over time however the final rules provide that small depository institution holding companies with less than  billion in total assets as of december   which includes the bancorp will be able to permanently include nonqualifying instruments that were issued and included in tier  or tier  capital prior to may   in additional tier  or tier  capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature in addition the final rules provide for smaller banking institutions less than  billion in consolidated assets an opportunity to make a onetime election to opt out of including most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital importantly the optout excludes from regulatory capital not only unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale debt securities but also accumulated net gains and losses on cashflow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit postretirement plans customers bank selected the optout election in its march   call report the final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions including the bank if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness these revisions took effect on january   under the prompt corrective action requirements which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized” i a common equity tier  capital ratio of  ii a tier  risk based capital ratio of

forth certain changes for the calculation of riskweighted assets which were required to be utilized as of january   the standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights and also addresses i an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with section a of the doddfrank act ii revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation iii rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans iv revised capital treatment for derivatives and repostyle transactions and v disclosure requirements for toptier banking organizations with  billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the “advance approach rules” that apply to banks with greater than  billion in consolidated assets as of december   and   management believed that the bank and bancorp met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject for additional information on customers regulatory capital ratios refer to “note  – regulatory matters” doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the doddfrank bill was enacted by congress on july   and was signed into law by president obama on july   among many other provisions the legislation   • established the financial stability oversight council a federal agency acting as the financial system’s systemic risk regulator with the authority to review the activities of significant bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms to make recommendations and impose standards regarding capital leverage conflicts and other requirements for financial firms and to impose regulatory standards on certain financial firms deemed to pose a systemic threat to the financial health of the us economy • created a new consumer financial protection bureau within the us federal reserve which has substantive rulemaking authority over a wide variety of consumer financial services and products including the power to regulate unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices • permitted state attorneys general and other state enforcement authorities broader power to enforce consumer protection laws against banks • authorized federal regulatory agencies to ban compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct that could pose risks to the nation’s financial system • granted the us government resolution authority to liquidate or take emergency measures with regard to troubled financial institutions such as bank holding companies that fall outside the existing resolution authority of the federal deposit insurance corporation • gave the fdic substantial new authority and flexibility in assessing deposit insurance premiums which may result in increased deposit insurance premiums for us in the future • increased the deposit insurance coverage limit for insurable deposits to  generally and removes the limit entirely for transaction accounts • permitted banks to pay interest on

transactions between banks and their insiders many of these provisions are subject to further rule making and to the discretion of regulatory bodies including customers bank’s primary federal banking regulator the federal reserve it is not possible to predict at this time the extent to which regulations authorized or mandated by the doddfrank act will impose requirements or restrictions on customers bank in addition to or different from the provisions summarized above  table of contents deposit insurance assessments  customers bank’s deposits are insured by the fdic up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system which was amended pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of  the “act” under this system the amount of fdic assessments paid by an individual insured depository institution like customers bank is based on the level of perceived risk incurred in its activities the fdic places a depository institution in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings in addition in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category the fdic further determines its assessment rates based on certain specified financial ratios on february   the fdic adopted a final rule modifying the riskbased assessment system and setting initial base assessment rates beginning april   ranging from  to  basis points of tier i capital in addition to deposit insurance assessments banks are subject to assessments to pay the interest on financing corporation bonds the financing corporation was created by congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions the fdic sets the financing corporation assessment rate every quarter community reinvestment act  under the community reinvestment act of  “cra” the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary banks must be considered by the appropriate federal banking agencies including the federal reserve board in reviewing and approving or disapproving a variety of regulatory applications including approval of a branch or other deposit facility office relocation a merger and certain acquisitions federal banking agencies have demonstrated an increased readiness to deny applications based on unsatisfactory cra performance the federal reserve board is required to assess our record to determine if we are meeting the credit needs of the community including low and moderate neighborhoods that we serve the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  amended the cra to require among other things that the federal reserve board make publicly available an evaluation of the bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community including low and moderateincome neighborhoods this evaluation includes a descriptive rating outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or substantial noncompliance and a statement describing the basis for the rating consumer protection laws  customers bank is subject to a variety of consumer protection laws including the truth in lending act the truth in savings act adopted as part of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  “fdicia” the equal credit opportunity act the home mortgage disclosure act the

substantial expense and administrative time on the part of customers bank holding company regulation as a bank holding company customers bancorp is also subject to additional regulation the bank holding company act requires the bancorp to secure the prior approval of the federal reserve board before it owns or controls directly or indirectly more than five percent  of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank it also prohibits acquisition by the bancorp of more than five percent  of the voting shares of or interest in or all or substantially all of the assets of any bank located outside of the state in which a current bank subsidiary is located unless such acquisition is specifically authorized by laws of the state in which such bank is located a bank holding company is prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five percent  of the voting shares of any company engaged in nonbanking activities unless the federal reserve board by order or regulation has found such activities to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto in making this determination the federal reserve board considers whether the performance of these activities by a bank holding company would offer benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects applications under the bank holding company act and the change in control act are subject to review based upon the record of compliance of the applicant with the cra the bancorp is required to file an annual report with the federal reserve board and any additional information that the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bank holding company act further under section  of the  amendments to the bank holding company act and the federal reserve board’s regulations a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tiein arrangements in connection with any extension of

before we sell or otherwise dispose of the bankmobile business if we are unable to complete the sale or other disposition of bankmobile before exceeding the  billion total asset threshold we would experience a significant reduction in bankmobile interchange fee income under federal law and regulation we must remain under  billion in total assets as of december  of each year to qualify as a small issuer of debit cards and receive the optimal debit card processing fee if we were to lose this status bankmobile would operate unprofitably unless we were able to generate additional fees to replace the lost interchange fee revenue as a result our inability to complete the sale of bankmobile to flagship bank or otherwise in a timely manner could materially and adversely affect our

take to complete the sale may adversely affect our relationships with bankmobile’s current and potential higher education institutions customers and our bankmobile employees and could result in the loss of customers and key employees further the actions needed to complete the sale of bankmobile may result in the diversion of our management’s attention from customers’ daytoday operations generally which could adversely affect customers’ business certain terms of our agreement with flagship bank may expose us to significant liabilities we have agreed to indemnify flagship bank and its directors and officers against losses and liabilities incurred by them in connection with the proposed sale and to indemnify them and certain others in connection with certain additional matters relating to the proposed sale in addition we have agreed to obtain at our expense director and officer liability insurance for the benefit of flagship bank’s directors and officers to cover them for similar losses and liabilities although our agreement to provide indemnification is subject to certain limitations and exceptions including limitations on the dollar amount of losses payable by us

flagship bank in a timely fashion or at all we will continue to face the risks and challenges associated with the bankmobile business including those relating to the integration of the disbursement business described in this risk factors discussion and elsewhere in this annual report on form k we cannot assure you that we will be able to address and manage these risks so as to preserve or increase the value of bankmobile and any failure to preserve or increase the value of bankmobile could adversely affect the business of customers as a whole and our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of bankmobile in an alternative transaction on favorable terms or at all risks related to the bancorp’s banking operations if our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio our earnings could decrease lending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment this risk is affected by among other things   • the financial condition and cash flows of the borrower andor the project being financed • the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral in the case of a collateralized loan • the discount on the loan at the time of its acquisition and capital which could have regulatory implications • the duration of the loan • the credit history of a particular borrower and • changes in economic and industry conditions at december    the bancorp’s allowance for loan losses totaled  million  which represents  of total loans held for investment management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of making payment as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses significant factors considered include loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio trends and absolute levels of classified and criticized loans trends and absolute levels in delinquent loans trends in risk ratings trends in industry and customers chargeoffs by particular segments and changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our lending areas and the national economy if our assumptions are incorrect our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio resulting in additions to the allowance  table of contents management reviews and reestimates the allowance for loan losses quarterly additions to our allowance for loan losses as a result on managements review and estimate could materially decrease net income our regulators as an integral part of their examination process periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan chargeoffs net of recoveries any such additional provisions for loan losses or chargeoffs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our emphasis on commercial multifamilycommercial real estate and mortgage warehouse lending may expose us to increased lending risks we intend to continue emphasizing the origination of commercial loans and specialty loans including loans to mortgage banking businesses commercial loans including multifamily and commercial real estate loans can expose a lender to risk of nonpayment and loss because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or property and the borrower’s cash flows such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to fourfamily residential mortgage loans in addition we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for an increase in probable credit losses associated with such loans also we expect that many of our commercial borrowers will have more than one loan outstanding with us consequently an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to fourfamily residential mortgage loan as a lender to mortgage banking businesses we provide financing to mortgage bankers by purchasing subject to resale under a master repurchase agreement the underlying residential mortgages on a shortterm basis pending the ultimate sale of the mortgages to investors we are subject to the risks associated with such lending including but not limited to the risks of fraud bankruptcy and possible default by the borrower closing agents and the residential borrower on the underlying mortgage any of which could result in credit losses the risk of fraud associated with this type of lending includes but is not limited to settlement process risks the risk of financing nonexistent loans or fictitious mortgage loan transactions or the risk that collateral delivered is fraudulent or nonexistent creating a risk of loss of the full amount financed on the underlying residential mortgage loan or in the settlement processes as discussed in note  – loss contingency in first quarter  a suspected fraud was discovered in the bank’s heldforsale loan portfolio additional fraudulent transactions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our lending to commercial mortgage businesses is a significant part of our assets and earnings this business is subject to cyclicality of the mortgage lending business and volumes are likely to decline if interest rates increase generally a decline in the rate of growth volume or profitability of this business unit or a loss of its leadership could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as of december    the bank had  billion in commercial loans outstanding composing approximately  of its total loan portfolio which includes loans held for sale decreased origination volume and pricing decisions of competitors may adversely affect our profitability the bank currently operates a residential mortgage banking business but plans to expand our origination sale and servicing of residential mortgage loans in the future the bank also began selling recent multifamily loan originations to third parties in third quarter  changes in market interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our residential mortgage and multifamily loan products the revenue realized on the sale of loans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others and ultimately reduce our net income new regulations increased regulatory reviews andor changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which we would utilize to sell mortgage loans or other rule changes that could affect the multifamily resale market may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business or sell multifamily loans  table of contents federal home loan bank of pittsburgh may not pay dividends or repurchase capital stock in the future on december   the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh “fhlb” announced that it would voluntarily suspend the payment of dividends and the repurchase of excess capital stock until further notice the fhlb announced at that time that it expected its ability to pay dividends and add to retained earnings to be significantly curtailed due to low shortterm interest rates an increased cost of maintaining liquidity other than temporary impairment charges and constrained access to debt markets at attractive rates while the fhlb resumed payment of dividends and capital stock repurchases in  capital stock repurchases from member banks are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the fhlb and there is no guarantee that such dividends and capital stock repurchases will continue in the future as of december    the bank held  million of fhlb capital stock the fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions adverse economic performance can lead to adverse security performance and otherthantemporary impairment as of december    the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was  million  we have historically followed a conservative investment strategy with concentrations in securities that are backed by government sponsored enterprises in the future we may seek to increase yields through more aggressive strategies which may include a greater percentage of corporate securities structured credit products or nonagency mortgage backed securities factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities these factors include but are not limited to rating agency actions in respect of the securities defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets any of these factors among others such as a change in managements intent to hold the securities until recovery in fair value could cause otherthantemporary impairments and realized andor unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income which could have a material adverse effect on us the process for determining whether impairment of a security is otherthantemporary usually requires complex subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security at december   management evaluated its equity holdings issued by religare enterprises limited for otherthantemporary impairment because management no longer has the intent to hold these securities until a recovery in fair value customers recorded an otherthantemporarily impairment loss of  million in fourth quarter  for the full amount of the decline in fair value below the cost basis the fair value of the equity securities at december   of  million became the new cost basis of the securities   changes to estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing financial statements could adversely affect the bancorp’s business operating results reported assets and liabilities financial condition and capital levels changes to estimates and assumptions made by management in connection with the preparation of the bancorp’s consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses the preparation of the bancorp’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods changes to management’s assumptions or estimates could materially and adversely affect customers business operating results reported assets and liabilities financial condition and capital levels changes in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial results our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations from time to time the fasb or the sec changes the financial accounting and reporting standards or the policies that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts the implementation of new or revised accounting guidance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or net worth notably the fasb recently issued a new framework for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses which could significantly alter the current estimate as well as other elements of the us banking model  table of contents downgrades in us government and federal agency securities could adversely affect customers bancorp and the bank the longterm impact of the downgrade of the us government and federal agencies from an aaa to an aa credit rating is still uncertain however in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions the downgrade and any future downgrades andor failures to raise the us debt limit if necessary in the future could among other things materially adversely affect the market value of the us and other government and governmental agency securities owned by customers bank the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition in particular it could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems money markets and longterm or shortterm fixed income markets adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding which could negatively affect profitability also the adverse consequences as a result of the downgrade could extend to the borrowers of the loans the bank makes and as a result could adversely affect its borrowers’ ability to repay their loans we may not be able to maintain consistent earnings or profitability although we made a profit for the years of  through   there can be no assurance that we will be able to remain profitable in future periods or if profitable that our overall earnings will remain consistent or increase in the future our earnings also may be reduced by increased expenses associated with increased assets such as additional employee compensation expense and increased interest expense on any liabilities incurred or deposits solicited to fund increases in assets if earnings do not grow proportionately with our assets or equity our overall profitability may be adversely affected continued or worsening general business and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us our business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the united states if the us economy experiences worsening conditions such as a recession we could be materially and adversely affected weak economic conditions may be characterized by deflation instability in debt and equity capital markets a lack of liquidity andor depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans increased delinquencies on loans residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity adverse changes in any of these factors could be detrimental to our business our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the us federal government its agencies and governmentsponsored entities adverse changes in economic factors or us government policies could have a negative effect on customers bancorp the geographic concentration in the northeast and midatlantic region makes our business susceptible to downturns in the local economies and depressed banking markets which could materially and adversely affect us our loan and deposit activities are largely based in the northeast and midatlantic regions as a result our financial performance depends upon economic conditions in this region this region experienced deteriorating local economic conditions in the past economic cycle and a downturn in the regional real estate market could harm our financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within this region and because a large percentage of the loans are secured by real property if there is decline in real estate values the collateral value for our loans will decrease and our probability of incurring losses will increase as the ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be lessened additionally customers has made a significant investment in commercial real estate loans often in a commercial real estate transaction repayment of the loan is dependent on the property generating sufficient rental income to service the loan economic conditions may affect the tenant’s ability to make rental payments on a timely basis and may cause some tenants not to renew their leases each of which may impact the debtor’s ability to make loan payments further if expenses associated with commercial properties increase dramatically the tenant’s ability to repay and therefore the debtor’s ability to make timely loan payments could be adversely affected all of these factors could increase the amount of nonperforming loans increase our provision for loan losses and reduce our net income  table of contents our business is highly susceptible to credit risk as a lender we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to the contractual terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans if any may not be sufficient to assure repayment the risks inherent in making any loan include risks with respect to the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and if applicable the period of time over which the loan is repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral similarly we have credit risk embedded in our securities portfolio our credit standards procedures and policies are designed to reduce the risk of credit losses to a low level but may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses additionally we may restructure originated or acquired loans if we believe the borrowers are experiencing problems servicing the debt pursuant to current terms and we believe the borrower is likely to fully repay their restructured obligations we may also be subject to legal or regulatory requirements for restructured loans with respect to restructured loans we may grant concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties in order to facilitate repayment of the loan by a reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining life of the loan to lower than the current market rate for new loans with similar risk or an extension of the maturity date we depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services we believe that the implementation of our strategy will depend in large part on the skills of our executive management team and our ability to motivate and retain these and other key personnel accordingly the loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect us leadership changes will occur from time to time and if significant resignations occur we may not be able to recruit additional qualified personnel we believe our executive management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate although our chief executive officer president and chief financial officer have entered into employment agreements with us it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreement or may choose not to renew it upon expiration our customers also rely on us to deliver personalized financial services our strategic model is dependent upon relationship managers and private bankers who act as a customer’s point of contact to us the loss of the service of these individuals could undermine the confidence of our customers in our ability to provide such personalized services we need to continue to attract and retain these individuals and to recruit other qualified individuals to ensure continued growth in addition competitors may recruit these individuals in light of the value of the individuals’ relationships with their customers and communities and we may not be able to retain such relationships absent the individuals in any case if we are unable to attract and retain our relationship managers and private bankers and recruit individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business our growth strategy business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve the loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations the loss of key senior personnel or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on us we face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers which may materially and adversely affect us commercial and consumer banking is highly competitive our markets contain a large number of community and regional banks as well as a significant presence of the country’s largest commercial banks we compete with other state and national financial institutions including savings and loan associations savings banks and credit unions for deposits and loans in addition we compete with financial intermediaries such as consumer finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies securities firms mutual funds and several government agencies as well as major retailers in providing various types of loans and other financial services some of these competitors may have a long history of successful operations in our markets greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships as well as better established depositor bases competitors may also have greater resources and access to capital and may possess other advantages such as operating more atms and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns or operating a more developed internet platform competitors may also exhibit a greater tolerance for risk and behave more aggressively with respect to pricing in order to increase their market share  table of contents the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services technological advances have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates as well as nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among others   • the ability to develop maintain and build upon longterm customer relationships based on high quality personal service effective and efficient products and services high ethical standards and safe and sound assets • the scope relevance and competitive pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands • the ability to provide customers with maximum convenience of access to services and availability of banking representatives • the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees to operate our business • the ability to expand our market position • customer access to our decision makers and customer satisfaction with our level of service and • the ability to operate our business effectively and efficiently failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could materially and adversely affect us like other financial services institutions our asset and liability structures are monetary in nature such structures are affected by a variety of factors including changes in interest rates which can impact the value of financial instruments held by us like other financial services institutions we have asset and liability structures that are essentially monetary in nature and are directly affected by many factors including domestic and international economic and political conditions broad trends in business and finance legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial communities monetary and fiscal policies inflation currency values market conditions the availability and terms including cost of shortterm or longterm funding and capital the credit capacity or perceived creditworthiness of customers and counterparties and the level and volatility of trading markets such factors can impact customers and counterparties of a financial services institution and may impact the value of financial instruments held by a financial services institution our earnings and cash flows largely depend upon the level of our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans investments and other interest earning assets and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest rate changes changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income when interestbearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a period an increase in interest rates would reduce net interest income similarly when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly and because the magnitude of repricing of interest earning assets is often greater than interest bearing liabilities falling interest rates would reduce net interest income accordingly changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets and liabilities loan and investment securities portfolios and our overall results changes in interest rates may also have a significant impact on any future loan origination revenues changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets both loans and investment securities on our balance sheet we may incur debt in the future and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates and any increase in interest rates could materially and adversely affect us interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies particularly the federal reserve adverse changes in the federal reserve’s interest rate policies or other changes in monetary policies and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us  table of contents we are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and thirdparty servicers and systems failures interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us our business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and thirdparty servicers we outsource many of our major systems such as data processing loan servicing and deposit processing systems the failure of these systems or the termination of a thirdparty software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based could interrupt our operations because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such thirdparty systems fail or experience interruptions if significant sustained or repeated a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business andor subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely including online over the internet and over the telephone the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses phishing schemes and other security breaches we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses to the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims regulatory scrutiny litigation and other possible liabilities any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us additionally financial products and services have become increasingly technologydriven our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and in a costefficient manner is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available certain competitors may have greater resources to invest in technology and may be better equipped to market new technologydriven products and services the ability to keep pace with technological change is important and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to adequately safeguard confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect the bancorp’s operations net income or reputation the bancorp regularly collects processes transmits and stores significant amounts of confidential information regarding its customers employees and others this information is necessary for the conduct of the bancorp’s business activities including the ongoing maintenance of deposit loan investment management and other account relationships for our customers and receiving instructions and affecting transactions for those customers and other users of the bancorp’s products and services in addition to confidential information regarding its customers employees and others the bancorp compiles processes transmits and stores proprietary nonpublic information concerning its own business operations plans and strategies in some cases this confidential or proprietary information is collected compiled processed transmitted or stored by third parties on behalf of the bancorp information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks a failure in or breach of the bancorp’s operational or information security systems or those of the bancorp’s thirdparty service providers as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches or due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs andor cause losses as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect the bancorp’s systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the bancorp if this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled misused or lost the bancorp could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences reputational damage civil litigation and financial loss mishandling misuse or loss of this confidential or proprietary information could occur for example if the confidential or proprietary information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of the systems or employees of the bancorp or the systems or employees of third parties which have collected compiled processed transmitted or stored the information on the bancorp’s behalf where the information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties or where there is a failure or breach of the network communications or information systems which are used to collect compile process transmit or store the information  table of contents although the bancorp employs a variety of physical procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling misuse or loss these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling misuse or loss of the information will not occur or that if mishandling misuse or loss of the information did occur those events would be promptly detected and addressed additionally as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve the bancorp may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities our directors and executive officers can influence the outcome of shareholder votes and in some cases shareholders may not have the opportunity to evaluate and affect the investment decision regarding a potential investment or acquisition transaction as of december    the directors and executive officers of customers bancorp as a group owned a total of  shares of voting common stock and exercisable options and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of voting common stock which potentially gives them as a group the ability to control approximately   of the issued and outstanding voting common stock in addition a director of customers bank who is not a director of customers bancorp owns an additional  shares of voting common stock which if combined with the directors and officers of customers bancorp potentially gives them as a group the ability to control approximately  of the issued and outstanding voting common stock we believe ownership of stock causes directors and officers to have the same interests as shareholders but it also gives them the ability to vote as shareholders for matters that are in their personal interest which may be contrary to the wishes of other shareholders shareholders will not necessarily be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of one or more target institutions any decision regarding a potential investment or acquisition transaction will be made by our board of directors except in limited circumstances as required by applicable law consummation of an acquisition will not require the approval of holders of voting common stock accordingly the shareholder may not have an opportunity to evaluate and affect the investment decision regarding potential investment or acquisition transactions we intend to engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time these acquisitions may not produce revenue or earnings enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties we regularly evaluate opportunities to strengthen our current market position by acquiring and investing in banks and in other complementary businesses or opening new branches and when appropriate opportunities arise subject to regulatory approval we plan to engage in acquisitions of other businesses and in opening new branches such transactions could individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition including short and longterm liquidity our acquisition activities could be material to our business for example we could issue additional shares of voting common stock in a purchase transaction which could dilute current shareholders’ value or ownership interest these activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash other liquid assets andor incur debt in addition if goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions were determined to be impaired then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized our acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks including the risks of   • incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating the terms of potential transactions resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business • using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit operations management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets • being potentially exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire • being required to expend time and expense to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses • experiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations • creating an adverse shortterm effect on our results of operations • losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received and • incurring significant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity being acquired into our financial and customer product systems  table of contents additionally in evaluating potential acquisition opportunities we may seek to acquire failed banks through fdicassisted acquisitions while the fdic may in such acquisitions provide assistance to mitigate certain risks such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution we may not be able to accurately estimate our potential exposure to loan losses and other potential liabilities or the difficulty of integration in acquiring such institutions depending on the condition of any institutions or assets that are acquired any acquisition may at least in the near term materially adversely affect our capital and earnings and if not successfully integrated following the acquisition may continue to have such effects we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on levels of reported net income return on equity and return on assets and the ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain market value our business and future success may suffer if we are unable to remain under  billion in total assets as of december  of each year before we sell or otherwise dispose of the bankmobile business including the disbursement business under federal law and regulation we must remain under  billion in total assets as of december  of each year to qualify as a small issuer of debit cards and receive the optimal debit card processing fee failure to qualify for the small issuer exception would result in a significant reduction in interchange fee income and would mean we would operate unprofitably or additional fees would need to be charged to students to replace the lost revenue to optimize the value of the customers franchise to shareholders we have stated our intention to sell bankmobile before crossing the  billion total asset threshold market conditions regulatory and legal conditions bankmobile’s performance and other factors some of which are not in our control may limit delay or prevent our planned sale and prevent us from remaining under the  billion total asset threshold before the planned disposition accordingly this could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in connection with the disbursement business we depend on our relationship with higher education institutions and in turn student usage of our products and services for future growth of our bankmobile business   the future growth of our bankmobile business depends in part on our ability to enter into agreements with higher education institutions our contracts with these clients can generally be terminated at will and therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these clients we may also be unable to maintain our agreements with these clients on terms and conditions acceptable to us in addition we may not be able to continue to establish new relationships with higher education institution clients the termination of our current client contracts or our inability to continue to attract new clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations establishing new client relationships and maintaining current ones are also essential components of our strategy for attracting new student customers deepening the relationship we have with existing customers and maximizing customer usage of our products and services a reduction in enrollment a failure to attract and maintain student customers as well as any future demographic or other trends that reduce the number of higher education students could materially and adversely affect bankmobiles capability for both revenue and cash generation and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations bankmobiles disbursement business depends on the current government financial aid regime that relies on the outsourcing of financial aid disbursements through higher education institutions in general the us federal government distributes financial aid to students through higher education institutions as intermediaries bankmobiles disbursement business provides our higher education institution clients an electronic system for improving the administrative efficiency of this refund disbursement process if the government through legislation or regulatory action restructures the existing financial aid regime in such a way that reduces or eliminates the intermediary role played by financial institutions serving higher education institutions or limits or regulates the role played by service providers such as us our business results of operations and bankmobiles prospects for future growth could be materially and adversely affected  table of contents a change in the availability of financial aid as well as us budget constraints could materially and adversely affect our financial performance by reducing demand for bankmobiles services the higher education industry depends heavily upon the ability of students to obtain financial aid as part of our contracts with our higher education institution clients that use bankmobiles disbursement business services students’ financial aid and other refunds are sent to us for disbursement the fees that we charge most of our disbursement business higher education institution clients are based on the number of financial aid disbursements that we make to students in addition our relationships with disbursement business higher education institution clients provide us with a market for bankmobile consequently a change in the availability or amount of financial aid that restricted client use of our disbursement business service or otherwise limited our ability to attract new higher education institution clients could materially and adversely affect our financial performance also decreases in the amount of financial aid disbursements from higher education institutions to students could materially and adversely affect our financial performance future legislative and executive branch efforts to reduce the us federal budget deficit or worsening economic conditions may require the government to severely curtail its financial aid spending which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations providing disbursement services to higher education institutions is an uncertain business if the market for bankmobiles products does not continue to develop we will not be able to grow this portion of our business the success of bankmobiles disbursement business will depend in part on our ability to generate revenues by providing financial transaction services to higher education institutions and their students the market for these services has evolved and the longterm viability and profitability of this market is unproven our business will be materially and adversely affected if we do not develop and market products and services that achieve and maintain market acceptance outsourcing disbursement services may not become as widespread in the higher education industry as we anticipate and our products and services may not achieve continued commercial success in addition higher education institution clients could discontinue using our services and return to inhouse disbursement solutions if outsourcing disbursement services does not become as widespread as we anticipate or if higher education institution clients return to their prior methods of disbursement our growth prospects business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate the disbursement businesses and technologies or to appropriately assess the risks associated with that transaction   the successful integration of the disbursement business on a costeffective basis may be critical to our future performance there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with such integration including we may not be able to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies regarding the disbursement business acquisition within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the disbursement business operations such integration may be more difficult timeconsuming or costly than expected we may not be successful in converting new clients gained through the acquisition to our own revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected operating costs client and customer loss and business disruption including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers clients or suppliers may be greater than expected following the acquisition we may have difficulty retaining certain key employees in the acquired disbursement business we may be subject to legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the acquisition agreement and the amount of the costs fees expenses and charges related to the acquisition may be greater than anticipated if we do not successfully integrate the disbursement business or if the benefits of this transaction do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts the market price of our common stock may decline even if we successfully integrate the disbursement business we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the integration and the acquired disbursement business may not perform as we expect or enhance the value of our business as a whole    our business and future success may suffer if we are unable to successfully implement our strategy to combine the disbursement business with bankmobile   a significant component of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to have students of our higher education institution clients select bankmobile during the refund disbursement selection process and to convert those student bankmobile customers along with the existing student customers we acquired through the disbursement business acquisition into lifetime customers with bankmobile as their primary banking relationship in particular our growth strategy depends on our ability to successfully crosssell our core banking products and services to these student customers after they graduate from college we may not be successful in implementing this strategy because these student customers and potential student customers may believe our products and services unnecessary or unattractive our failure to sell our products and services to students after they graduate and to attract new student customers could have a material adverse effect on our prospects business financial condition and results of operations  table of contents if the integration of the disbursement business disrupts our business operations and prevents us from realizing intended benefits our business may be harmed   the integration of the disbursement business may disrupt the operation of our business and prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of the disbursement business as a result of a number of obstacles such as the loss of key employees customers or business partners the failure to adjust or implement our business strategies additional expenditures required to facilitate the integration and the diversion of management’s attention from our daytoday operations breaches of security measures unauthorized access to or disclosure of data relating to our higher education institution clients or bankmobile and student bankmobile account holders computer viruses or unauthorized software malware fraudulent activity and infrastructure failures could materially and adversely affect our reputation or harm our business   companies that process and transmit cardholder information have been specifically and increasingly targeted by sophisticated criminal organizations in an effort to obtain the information and utilize it for fraudulent transactions the encryption software and the other technologies we use to provide security for storage processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information may not be effective to protect against data security breaches the risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers   unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could result in the theft or publication of the information or the deletion or modification of sensitive records and could cause interruptions in our operations any inability to prevent security breaches could damage our relationships with our higher education institution customers cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders expose us to liability for unauthorized purchases and subject us to network fines these claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation if unsuccessful in defending that litigation we might be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices further a significant data security breach could lead to additional regulation which could impose new and costly compliance obligations any material increase in our costs resulting from litigation or additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues and profitability   in addition our higher education institution clients and student bankmobile account holders disclose to us certain “personally identifiable” information including student contact information identification numbers and the amount of credit balances which they expect we will maintain in confidence it is possible that hackers customers or employees acting unlawfully or contrary to our policies or other individuals could improperly access our or our vendors’ systems and obtain or disclose data about our customers further because customer data may also be collected stored or processed by thirdparty vendors it is possible that these vendors could intentionally negligently or otherwise disclose data about our clients or customers   we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems databases and infrastructure and take reasonable steps to protect them however due to their size complexity content and integration with or reliance on thirdparty systems they are vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion natural disaster and random attack all of which pose a risk of exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized persons or to the public   a cybersecurity breach of our information systems could lead to fraudulent activity such as identity theft losses on the part of our banking customers additional security costs negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand in addition our customers could be subject to scams that may result in the release of sufficient information concerning themselves or their accounts to allow others unauthorized access to their accounts or our systems eg “phishing” and “smishing” claims for compensatory or other damages may be brought against us as a result of a breach of our systems or fraudulent activity if we are unsuccessful in defending against any resulting claims against us we may be forced to pay damages which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures    further computer viruses or malware could infiltrate our systems thus disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable although we utilize several preventative and detective security controls in our network they may be ineffective in preventing computer viruses or malware that could damage our relationships with our merchant customers cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders or cause us to be in noncompliance with applicable network rules and regulations    table of contents in addition a significant incident of fraud or an increase in fraud levels generally involving our products could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use of our products and services such incidents could also lead to a large financial loss as a result of the protection for unauthorized purchases we provide to bankmobile customers given that we may be liable for any uncollectible account holder overdrafts and any other losses due to fraud or theft such incidents of fraud could also lead to regulatory intervention which could increase our compliance costs compliance with the various complex laws and regulations is costly and time consuming and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally increased regulatory requirements on our services may increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations accordingly account data breaches and related fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our future growth prospects business financial condition and results of operations a disruption to our systems or infrastructure could damage our reputation expose us to legal liability cause us to lose customers and revenue result in the unintentional disclosure of confidential information or require us to expend significant efforts and resources or incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data and security concerns the harm to our business could be even greater if such an event occurs during a period of disproportionately heavy demand for our products or services or traffic on our systems or networks prior to our acquisition of the disbursement business the federal reserve board and fdic took regulatory enforcement action against higher one which subjected us to regulatory inquiry and potential regulatory enforcement action which may result in liabilities adversely affecting our business financial conditions andor results of operations or in reputational harm since august  until the acquisition of the disbursement business customers provided deposit accounts and services to college students through higher one which had relationships with colleges and universities in the united states using higher one’s technological services because higher one was not a bank it had to partner with one or more banks to provide the deposit accounts and services to students higher one and one of higher one’s former bank partners the “predecessor bank” announced in may  that the federal reserve board notified them that certain disclosures and operating processes of these entities may have violated certain laws and regulations and may result in penalties and restitution in may  the federal reserve also informed customers as one of higher one’s bank partners that it was recommending a regulatory enforcement action be initiated against customers bank based on the same allegations in july  the predecessor bank referenced above which no longer is a partner with higher one entered into a consent order to cease and desist with the federal reserve board pursuant to which it agreed to pay a total of  million in civil money penalties and an additional amount that it may be required to pay in restitution to students in the event higher one is unable to pay the restitution obligations if any imposed on higher one “backup restitution” customers bank believes that the circumstances of its relationship with higher one and the student customers are different than the relationship between the predecessor bank and higher one and the student customers in december  higher one entered into consent orders with both the federal reserve board and the fdic under the consent order with the federal reserve board higher one agreed to pay  million in civil money penalties and  million in restitution to students under the consent order with the fdic higher one agreed to pay an additional  million in civil money penalties and  million in restitution to students in addition a third partner bank which is regulated by the fdic also entered into a consent order to cease and desist with the fdic pursuant to which it agreed to pay  million in civil money penalties and an additional amount in restitution to students in the event higher one is unable to meet its restitution obligation customers believes that it identified key critical alleged compliance deficiencies within  days of first accepting deposits through its relationship with higher one and caused such deficiencies to be remediated within approximately  days in addition customers understands that the total amount of fees that higher one collected from students who opened accounts at customers during the relevant time period is substantially less than the total fees that higher one collected from students who opened deposit accounts at the other partner banks during the relevant time period in addition as higher one paid the restitution and deposited such monies to pay the required restitution customers does not expect that backup restitution will be required nonetheless as previously disclosed customers had been in discussions with the federal reserve board regarding these matters from  and in an effort to move forward on december   customers agreed to the issuance by the federal reserve board of a combined order to cease and desist and order of assessment of a civil money penalty issued upon consent pursuant to the federal deposit insurance act as amended the order and agreed to a penalty of    table of contents customers remains subject to the jurisdiction and examination of the federal reserve board and further action could be taken to the extent we do not comply with the terms of the order or if the federal reserve board were to identify additional violations of applicable laws and regulations any further action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions andor results of operations or our reputation termination of or changes to the mastercard association registration could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   the student checking account debit cards issued in connection with the disbursement business are subject to mastercard association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by mastercard for acts or omissions by us or businesses that work with us the termination of the card association registration held by us or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide our products and services could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our business and future success may suffer if we are unable to continue to successfully implement our strategy for bankmobile the effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs however some new technologies including bankmobile are not fully tested and we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in order for bankmobile to compete effectively revenue generated from bankmobile’s no fee or very low fee banking strategy may not perform as well as we expect or enhance the value of our business as a whole and it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if the benefits of bankmobile do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts the market price of our common stock may decline our acquisitions generally will require regulatory approvals and failure to obtain them would restrict our growth we intend to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of community banking franchises and other businesses generally any acquisition of target financial institutions banking centers or other banking assets by us may require approval by and cooperation from a number of governmental regulatory agencies possibly including the federal reserve the occ and the fdic as well as state banking regulators in acting on applications federal banking regulators consider among other factors   • the effect of the acquisition on competition • the financial condition liquidity results of operations capital levels and future prospects of the applicant and the banks involved • the quantity and complexity of previously consummated acquisitions • the managerial resources of the applicant and the banks involved • the convenience and needs of the community including the record of performance under the community reinvestment act “cra” • the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities and • the extent to which the acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system such regulators could deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations which could restrict our growth or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us for example we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approvals and such a condition may not be acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of any acquisition  table of contents the success of future transactions will depend on our ability to successfully identify and consummate acquisitions of banking franchises that meet our investment objectives because of the intense competition for acquisition opportunities and the limited number of potential targets we may not be able to successfully consummate acquisitions on attractive terms or at all that are necessary to grow our business our acquisition history should be viewed in the context of the recent opportunities available to us as a result of the confluence of our access to capital at a time when market dislocations of historical proportions resulted in attractive asset acquisition opportunities as conditions change we may prove to be unable to execute our acquisition strategy which could materially and adversely affect us the success of future transactions will depend on our ability to successfully identify and consummate transactions with target banking franchises that meet our investment objectives there are significant risks associated with our ability to identify and successfully consummate these acquisitions there are a limited number of acquisition opportunities and we expect to encounter intense competition from other banking organizations competing for acquisitions and also from other investment funds and entities looking to acquire financial institutions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and consummating acquisitions directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess ongoing banking operations with greater financial technical human and other resources and access to capital than we do which could limit the acquisition opportunities we pursue our competitors may be able to achieve greater cost savings through consolidating operations or otherwise than we could these competitive limitations give others an advantage in pursuing certain acquisitions in addition increased competition may drive up the prices for the acquisitions we pursue and make the other acquisition terms more onerous which would make the identification and successful consummation of those acquisitions less attractive to us competitors may be willing to pay more for acquisitions than we believe are justified which could result in us having to pay more for them than we prefer or to forego the opportunity as a result of the foregoing we may be unable to successfully identify and consummate acquisitions on attractive terms or at all that are necessary to grow our business we will generally establish the pricing of transactions and the capital structure of banking franchises to be acquired by us on the basis of financial projections for such banking franchises in general projected operating results will be based on the judgment of our management team in all cases projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed and the projected results may vary significantly from actual results general economic political and market conditions can have a material adverse impact on the reliability of such projections in the event that the projections made in connection with our acquisitions or future projections with respect to new acquisitions are not accurate such inaccuracies could materially and adversely affect us we are subject to certain risks related to fdicassisted acquisitions the success of past fdicassisted acquisitions and any fdicassisted acquisitions in which we may participate in the future will depend on a number of factors including our ability to   • fully integrate and to integrate successfully the branches acquired into bank operations • limit the outflow of deposits held by new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage interestearning assets loans acquired in fdicassisted acquisitions • retain existing deposits and to generate new interestearning assets in the geographic areas previously served by the acquired banks • effectively compete in new markets in which we did not previously have a presence • successfully deploy the cash received in the fdicassisted acquisitions into assets bearing sufficiently high yields without incurring unacceptable credit or interest rate risk • control the incremental noninterest expense from the acquired branches in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio • retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff the acquired branches and • earn acceptable levels of interest and noninterest income including fee income from the acquired bank as with any acquisition involving a financial institution particularly one involving the transfer of a large number of bank branches as is often the case with fdicassisted acquisitions there may be higher than average levels of service disruptions that would cause inconveniences or potentially increase the effectiveness of competing financial institutions in attracting our customers integrating the acquired branches could present unique challenges and opportunities because of the nature of the transactions integration efforts will also likely divert our management’s attention and resources it is not known whether we will be able to integrate acquired branches successfully and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees  table of contents the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the fdicassisted acquisitions we may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during integration that could materially adversely affect our earnings and financial condition additionally we may be unable to compete effectively in the market areas previously served by the acquired branches or to manage any growth resulting from fdicassisted acquisitions effectively our willingness and ability to grow acquired branches following fdicassisted acquisitions depend on several factors most importantly the ability to retain certain key personnel that we hire or transfer in connection with fdicassisted acquisitions our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect the success of fdicassisted acquisitions and our future growth fdicassisted acquisition opportunities may not become available and increased competition may make it more difficult for us to bid on failed bank transactions on terms considered to be acceptable our nearterm business strategy includes consideration of potential acquisitions of failing banks that the fdic plans to place in receivership the fdic may not place banks that meet our strategic objectives into receivership failed bank transactions are attractive opportunities in part because of loss sharing arrangements with the fdic that limit the acquirer’s downside risk on the purchased loan portfolio and apart from our assumption of deposit liabilities we have significant discretion as to the nondeposit liabilities that we assume in addition assets purchased from the fdic are marked to their fair value and in many cases there is little or no addition to goodwill arising from an fdicassisted acquisition the bidding process for failing banks could become very competitive and the increased competition may make it more difficult for us to bid on terms we consider to be acceptable further all fdicassisted acquisitions would require us to obtain applicable regulatory approval some institutions we could acquire may have distressed assets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the value predicted from these assets or that we will make sufficient provision for future losses in the value of or accurately estimate the future writedowns taken in respect of these assets loan portfolios and other assets acquired in transactions may experience increases in delinquencies and losses in the loan portfolios or in amounts that exceed initial forecasts developed during the due diligence investigation prior to acquiring those institutions in addition asset values may be impaired in the future due to factors that cannot currently be predicted including deterioration in economic conditions and subsequent declines in collateral values and credit quality indicators any of these events could adversely affect the financial condition liquidity capital position and value of institutions acquired and of our business as a whole further as a registered bank holding company if we acquire bank subsidiaries they may become subject to crossguaranty liability under applicable banking law if we do so and any of the foregoing adverse events occur with respect to one subsidiary they may adversely affect other subsidiaries asset valuations are estimates of value and there is no certainty that we will be able to sell assets of target institutions at the estimated value even if it is determined to be in our best interests to do so the institutions we may target may have substantial amounts of asset classes for which there is currently limited or no marketability as a result of an investment or acquisition transaction we may be required to take writedowns or writeoffs restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations we conduct due diligence investigations of target institutions we intend to acquire due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations accounting finance and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process even if extensive due diligence is conducted on a target institution with which we may be combined this diligence may not reveal all material issues that may affect a particular target institution and factors outside our control or the control of the target institution may later arise if during the diligence process we fail to identify issues specific to a target institution or the environment in which the target institution operates we may be forced to later write down or write off assets restructure operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses these charges may also occur if we are not successful in integrating and managing the operations of the target institution with which we combine in addition charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming preexisting debt held by a target institution or by virtue of obtaining debt financing  table of contents resources could be expended in considering or evaluating potential investment or acquisition transactions that are not consummated which could materially and adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business we anticipate that the investigation of each specific target institution and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others if a decision is made not to complete a specific investment or acquisition transaction the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable furthermore even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific target institution we may fail to consummate the investment or acquisition transaction for any number of reasons including those beyond our control any such event will result in a loss of the related costs incurred and could result in additional costs or expenses which could materially and adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another institution and our reported earnings if we do not open new branches as planned or do not achieve targeted profitability on new branches earnings may be reduced customers bank is interested in opening or acquiring four to six new branches annually for the next several years in and around our target markets of southeastern pennsylvania new jersey new york maryland connecticut virginia and delaware our ability to open or acquire branches is subject to regulatory approvals we cannot predict whether the banking regulators will agree with our growth plans or if or when they will provide the necessary branch approvals numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch such as the ability to select a suitable location competition our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and the effectiveness of our marketing strategy it takes time for a new branch to generate significant deposits and loan volume to offset expenses some of which like salaries and occupancy expense are relatively fixed costs the initial cost including capital asset purchases for each new branch to open would be in a range of approximately  to  additionally there can be no assurance that any of these new branches will ever become profitable during the period of time before a branch can become profitable operating a branch will negatively impact net income to the extent that we are unable to increase loans through organic loan growth we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy which could materially and adversely affect us in addition to growing our business through strategic acquisitions we also intend to grow our business through organic loan growth while loan growth has been strong and our loan balances have increased over the past three fiscal years much of the loan growth came from multifamily and commercial real estate lending if the bank is unsuccessful with diversifying its loan originations or if we do not grow the existing business lines our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted we may not be able to effectively manage our growth our future operating results and financial condition depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth our growth has placed and it may continue to place significant demands on our operations and management whether through additional acquisitions or organic growth our current plan to expand our business is dependent upon our ability to   • continue to implement and improve our operational credit underwriting and administration financial accounting enterprise risk management and other internal and disclosure controls and processes and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage a growing number of client relationships • comply with changes in and an increasing number of laws rules and regulations including those of any national securities exchange on which any of our securities become listed • scale our technology and other systems’ platforms • maintain and attract appropriate staffing • operate profitably or raise capital and • support our asset growth with adequate deposits funding and liquidity while maintaining our net interest margin and meeting our customers’ and regulators’ liquidity requirements  table of contents we may not successfully implement improvements to or integrate our management information and control systems credit underwriting and administration internal and disclosure controls and procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls in particular our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in loan volume in various markets and the infrastructure that comes with new banking centers and banks our growth strategy may divert management from our existing business and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure and if we are unable to effectively manage and grow our banking franchise including to the satisfaction of our regulators we could be materially and adversely affected in addition if we are unable to manage our current and future expansion in our operations we may experience compliance operational and regulatory problems and delays have to slow our pace of growth or even stop our market and product expansion or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth any one of which could materially and adversely affect us if we experience difficulties with the development of new business activities or the integration process of acquired businesses the anticipated benefits of any particular acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected additionally we may be unable to recognize synergies operating efficiencies andor expected benefits within expected timeframes and cost projections or at all we also may not be able to preserve the goodwill of an acquired financial institution our growth could lead to increases in our legal audit administrative and financial compliance costs which could materially and adversely affect us if our techniques for managing risk are ineffective we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses in order to manage the significant risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to material risks such as credit operational legal and reputational risks our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design their implementation or the degree to which we adhere to them or as a result of the lack of adequate accurate or timely information or otherwise if our risk management efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we could be subject to litigation particularly from our customers and sanctions or fines from regulators our techniques for managing the risks we face may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market environments including exposure to risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate we are dependent upon maintaining an effective system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions and activities are conducted in accordance with established policies and procedures and are all captured and reported in the financial statements failure to comply with the system of internal controls may result in events or losses which could adversely affect customers operations net income financial condition reputation and compliance with laws and regulations customers system of internal controls including internal controls over financial reporting is an important element of our risk management framework management regularly reviews and seeks to improve customers’ internal controls including annual review of key policies and procedures and annual review and testing of key internal controls over financial reporting any system of internal controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and expectations of employee conduct and can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal control structure are met any failure or circumvention of customers’ controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the customers’ operations net income financial condition reputation and compliance with laws and regulations we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our loan funding obligations deposit withdrawals or other business needs and fund our asset growth unless we maintain sufficient liquidity customers bank must maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its balance sheet growth in order to successfully grow our revenues make loans and to repay deposit and other liabilities as these mature or are drawn this liquidity can be gathered in both wholesale and nonwholesale funding markets our asset growth over the past few years has been funded with various forms of deposits and wholesale funding including brokered and wholesale time deposits fhlb advances and federal funds line borrowings total wholesale deposits including brokered and municipal deposits were  of total deposits at december    our gross loan to deposit ratio was  at december   and our loan to deposit ratio excluding the mortgage warehouse portfolio funded by short term fhlb borrowings was  at december    wholesale funding can cost more than deposits generated from our traditional branch system and customer relationships and is subject to certain practical limits such as our liquidity policy limits our available collateral for fhlb borrowings capacity and federal funds line limits with our lenders additionally regulators consider wholesale funding beyond certain points to be imprudent and might suggest that future asset growth be reduced or halted in the absence of appropriate levels and mix of funding we might need to reduce interestearning asset growth through the reduction of current production sales of loans andor the sale of participation interests in future and current loans this might reduce our future growth and net income  table of contents the amount of funds loaned to us is generally dependent on the value of the eligible collateral pledged and our financial condition these lenders could reduce the percentages loaned against various collateral categories eliminate certain types of collateral and otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs if further disruptions in the capital markets occur any change or termination of our borrowings from the fhlb or correspondent banks could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition including liquidity we may not be able to develop and retain a strong core deposit base and other lowcost stable funding sources customers bank depends on checking savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as a primary source of funding for our lending activities we expect that our future loan growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong lowcost deposit base because  of our deposit base as of december   was time deposits it may prove harder to maintain and grow our deposit base than would otherwise be the case especially since many of these deposits currently pay interest at abovemarket rates as of december     billion  or   of our total time deposits are scheduled to mature through december   we are working to transition certain of our customers to lower cost traditional bank deposits as higher cost funding such as time deposits mature if interest rates increase whether due to changes in inflation monetary policy competition or other factors we would expect to pay higher interest rates on deposits which would increase our funding costs and compress our net interest margin we may not succeed in moving our deposits to lower yielding savings and transactions products which could materially and adversely affect us in addition with concerns about bank failures over the past several years and the end of the fdic’s noninterest transaction deposit guarantee program on december   customers particularly those who may maintain deposits in excess of insured limits have become concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the fdic our customers may withdraw deposits to ensure that their deposits with us are fully insured and may place excess amounts in other institutions or make investments that are perceived as being more secure andor higher yielding further even if we are able to maintain and grow our deposit base deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market will provide a better riskreturn tradeoff if customers move money out of bank deposits we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income additionally any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including liquidity our “hightouch” personalized service banking model may be replicated by competitors we expect to drive organic growth by employing our concierge banking® strategy which provides specific relationship managers or private bankers for all customers many of our competitors provide similar services and others may replicate our model our competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be able to provide similar services more quickly efficiently and extensively to the extent others replicate our model we could lose what we view as a competitive advantage and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected competitors’ technologydriven products and services and improvements to such products and services may adversely affect our ability to generate core deposits through mobile banking our organic growth strategy focuses on among other things expanding market share through our “hightech” model which includes remote account opening remote deposit capture and mobile banking these technological advances such as bankmobile are intended to allow the bank to generate additional core deposits at a lower cost than generating deposits through opening and operating branch locations some of our competitors may have greater resources to invest in technology and may be better equipped to market new technologydriven products and services this may result in limiting reducing or otherwise adversely affecting our growth strategy in this area and our access to deposits through mobile banking in addition to the extent we fail to keep pace with technological changes or incur respectively large expenses to implement technological changes our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected we may suffer losses due to minority investments in other financial institutions or related companies from time to time we may make or consider making minority investments in other financial institutions or technology companies in the financial services business if we do so we may not be able to influence the activities of companies in which we invest and may suffer losses due to these activities investments in foreign companies could pose additional risks as a result of distance language barriers and potential lack of information for example foreign institutions including foreign financial institutions may not be obligated to provide as much information regarding their operations as those in the united states our investment in religare enterprises limited or religare which is a diversified financial services company in india represents such an investment in fourth quarter  we announced our decision to exit our investment in religare as a result of that decision we recorded an impairment loss of  million in earnings in fourth quarter  and adjusted our cost basis of the  table of contents religare securities to their estimated fair value of  million at december   to the extent we are unable to exit the religare investment as planned and pursuant to the terms contemplated further declines in the market price per share of the religare common stock and adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are required to hold capital for united states bank regulatory purposes to support our investment in religare securities under the newly adopted us capital adequacy rules which became effective as of january   we have to hold risk based capital based on the amount of religare common stock we own based upon the implementation of the final us capital adequacy rules these investments are currently subject to risk weighting of  of the amount of the investment however to the extent future aggregated carrying value of certain equity exposures exceed  of the bancorps then total capital risk weightings of  may apply any capital that is required to be used to support our religare investment will not be available to support our united states operations or customers bank if needed risks relating to the regulation of our industry the implementation of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  may have a material adverse effect on our business on july   president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  which we refer to as the “doddfrank act” which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes the key effects of the doddfrank act on our business are   • changes to regulatory capital requirements • exclusion of hybrid securities including trust preferred securities issued on or after may   from tier  capital • creation of new government regulatory agencies such as the financial stability oversight council which will oversee systemic risk and the consumer financial protection bureau which will develop and enforce rules for bank and nonbank providers of consumer financial products • potential limitations on federal preemption • changes to deposit insurance assessments • regulation of debit interchange fees we earn • changes in retail banking regulations including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge and • changes in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention in addition the doddfrank act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds the doddfrank act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments some provisions of the doddfrank act became effective immediately upon its enactment many provisions however still require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented some of which have been proposed by the applicable federal agencies the provisions of the doddfrank act may have unintended effects which will not be clear until implementation the changes resulting from the doddfrank act could limit our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices impose upon us more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise materially and adversely affect us these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements failure to comply with the new requirements could also materially and adversely affect us any changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations could be materially adverse to investors in our voting common stock for a more detailed description of the doddfrank act see “supervision and regulation – changes in laws regulations or policies and the doddfrank act”  table of contents new regulations could adversely impact our earnings due to among other things increased compliance costs or costs due to noncompliance the consumer financial protection bureau issued a rule effective as of january   designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the doddfrank act which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage loans that satisfy this “qualified mortgage” safeharbor will be presumed to have complied with the new abilitytorepay standard under the consumer financial protection bureau’s rule a “qualified mortgage” loan must not contain certain specified features including but not limited to i excessive upfront points and fees those exceeding  of the total loan amount less “bona fide discount points” for prime loans ii interestonly payments iii negativeamortization and iv terms longer than  years also to qualify as a “qualified mortgage” a borrower’s total monthly debt servicetoincome ratio may not exceed  lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years taking into account all applicable taxes insurance and assessments the consumer financial protection bureau’s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers or could make it more expensive andor time consuming to make these loans which could adversely impact our growth or profitability additionally on december   five financial regulatory agencies including our primary federal regulator the federal reserve adopted final rules the “final rules” implementing the socalled volcker rule embodied in section  of the bank holding company act which was added by section  of the doddfrank act the final rules prohibit banking entities from among other things  engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for their own accounts and  having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds “covered funds” the final rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions the final rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the volcker rule which must include for the largest entities making regular reports about those activities to regulators community banks such as customers have been afforded some relief under the final rules if such banks are engaged only in exempted proprietary trading such as trading in us government agency state and municipal obligations they are exempt entirely from compliance program requirements moreover even if a community bank engages in proprietary trading or covered fund activities under the rule they need only incorporate references to the volcker rule into their existing policies and procedures the final rules were effective april   but the conformance period has been extended from its statutory end date of july   until july   and the federal reserve has announced its intention to further extend the conformance period until july   management continues to evaluate the final rules which are lengthy and detailed we operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations corporate governance executive compensation and accounting principles or changes in them or our failure to comply with them could materially and adversely affect us we are subject to extensive regulation supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations intended to protect customers depositors and the fdic’s deposit insurance fund the “dif” and not our shareholders these laws and regulations among other matters prescribe minimum capital requirements impose limitations on our business activities limit the dividends or distributions that we can pay restrict the ability of our subsidiary bank to engage in transactions with the bancorp and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs and may make certain products impermissible or uneconomic our failure to comply with these laws and regulations even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation could subject us to restrictions on our business activities reputational harm fines and other penalties any of which could materially and adversely affect us further any new laws rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive and also materially and adversely affect us our use of third party vendors and our other ongoing third party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention we regularly use third party vendors as part of our business and have other ongoing business relationships with other third parties these types of third party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by federal banking regulators regulation requires us to perform enhanced due diligence perform ongoing monitoring and control our third party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships in certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements which could increase our costs we expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third party relationships and in the  table of contents performance of the parties with which we have these relationships as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third party vendors or other ongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations and to regular examinations by our regulators of our business and compliance with laws and regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to adequately address any matters identified during our examinations could materially and adversely affect us federal banking agencies regularly conduct comprehensive examinations of our business including our compliance with applicable laws regulations and policies applicable to the bancorp and the bank examination reports and ratings which often are not publicly available and other aspects of this supervisory framework can materially impact the conduct organic and acquisition growth and profitability of our business our regulators have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities and may impose a variety of remedial actions conditions or limitations on our business operations if as a result of an examination they determined that our financial condition capital resources asset quality earnings prospects management liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory or that the bancorp or its management was in violation of any law regulation or policy examples of those actions conditions or limitations include enjoining “unsafe or unsound” practices requiring affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any asserted violation of law issuing administrative orders that can be judicially enforced directing increases in our capital assessing civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors removing officers and directors and if a conclusion was reached that the offending conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors terminating our deposit insurance other actions formal or informal that may be imposed could restrict our growth including regulatory denials to expand branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates expand into new financial activities or merge with or purchase other financial institutions the timing of these examinations including the timing of the resolution of any issues identified by our regulators in the examinations and the final determination by them with respect to the imposition of any remedial actions conditions or limitations on our business operations is generally not within our control we also could suffer reputational harm in the event of any perceived or actual noncompliance with certain laws and regulations if we become subject to such regulatory actions we could be materially and adversely affected other litigation and regulatory actions including possible enforcement actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities our business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks as a result of a number of factors including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry generally this focus has only intensified since the latest financial crisis with regulators and prosecutors focusing on a variety of financial institution practices and requirements we may from time to time be the subject of subpoenas requests for information reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory or punitive damages significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished income and damage to our reputation our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities as a result the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could be material to our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows depending on among other factors the level of our earnings for that period and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fdic’s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could materially and adversely affect us the fdic insures deposits at fdicinsured depository institutions up to applicable limits the amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institution’s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators market developments have significantly depleted the dif of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act the fdic has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit insurance premiums for insured depository institutions if these increases are insufficient for the dif to meet its funding requirements there may need to be further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic  table of contents insurance if there are additional bank or financial institution failures we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels any future additional assessments increases or required prepayments in fdic insurance premiums may materially and adversely affect us including by reducing our profitability or limiting our ability to pursue certain business opportunities the federal reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support our subsidiary banks as a matter of policy the federal reserve which examines us and our subsidiaries expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank under the “source of strength” doctrine the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank in addition the doddfrank act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution under this requirement we could be required to provide financial assistance to customers bank or any other subsidiary banks we may own in the future should they experience financial distress a capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds or raise additional equity capital from third parties any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company’s general unsecured creditors including the holders of its indebtedness any financing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection may be difficult and expensive and may not be available on attractive terms or at all which likely would have a material adverse effect on us the longterm impact of the new regulatory capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules on us banks is uncertain on september   the basel committee on banking supervision announced an agreement to a strengthened set of capital requirements for internationally active banking organizations in the united states and around the world known as basel iii basel iii narrows the definition of capital introduces requirements for minimum tier  common capital increases requirements for minimum tier  capital and total riskbased capital and changes riskweighting methodologies basel iii is scheduled to be phased in over time until fully phased in by january   on july   the federal reserve adopted a final rule regarding new capital requirements pursuant to basel iii these rules which became effective on january   for community banks increase the required amount of regulatory capital that we must hold and failure to comply with the capital rules will lead to limitations on the dividend payments to us by customers bank and other elective distributions various provisions of the doddfrank act increase the capital requirements of bank holding companies such as customers bancorp and nonbank financial companies that are supervised by the federal reserve the leverage and riskbased capital ratios of these entities may not be lower than the leverage and riskbased capital ratios for insured depository institutions the basel iii changes and other regulatory capital requirements will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards for the bank and the bancorp we face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering statutes and regulations the federal bank secrecy act the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  the “patriot act” and other laws and regulations require financial institutions among other duties to institute and maintain an effective antimoney laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate the federal financial crimes enforcement network established by the us treasury department to administer the bank secrecy act is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators as well as the us department of justice drug enforcement administration and internal revenue service there is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the office of foreign assets control the “ofac” if our policies procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient we would be subject to liability including fines and regulatory  table of contents actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan including our acquisition plans which could materially and adversely affect us failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us federal state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business federal state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered “predatory” these laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property it is our policy not to make predatory loans but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities they increase our cost of doing business and ultimately may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make loans that we make through certain federal programs are dependent on the federal government’s continuation and support of these programs and on our compliance with their requirements  we participate in various us government agency guarantee programs including programs operated by the small business administration we are responsible for following all applicable us government agency regulations guidelines and policies whenever we originate loans as part of these guarantee programs if we fail to follow any applicable regulations guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program any loans we originate as part of that program may lose the associated guarantee exposing us to credit risk we would not otherwise be exposed to or underwritten as part of our origination process for us government agency guaranteed loans or result in our inability to continue originating loans under such programs the loss of any guarantees for loans we have extended under us government agency guarantee programs or the loss of our ability to participate in such programs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in connection with customers’ acquisition of the disbursement business customers is subject to further substantial federal and state governmental regulation related to the disbursement business that could change and thus force us to make modifications to the disbursement business compliance with the various complex laws and regulations is costly and time consuming and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally increased regulatory requirements on the disbursement business may increase costs which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results   as a third party servicer under the title iv regulations we are directly or indirectly subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations our contracts with most of our higher education institution clients require us to comply with applicable laws and regulations including • title iv of the higher education act of  or title iv • the family educational rights and privacy act of  or ferpa • the usa patriot act and related antimoney laundering requirements and • certain federal rules regarding safeguarding personal information including rules implementing the privacy provisions of grammleachbliley act of  or glba           higher education regulations   thirdparty servicer because of the services we provide to some institutions with regard to the handling of title iv funds we are considered a “thirdparty servicer” under the title iv regulations those regulations require a thirdparty servicer annually to submit a compliance audit conducted by outside independent auditors that cover the servicer’s title iv activities each year we must submit a “compliance attestation examination of the title iv student financial assistance programs” audit to the department of education “ed” which includes a report by an independent audit firm this yearly compliance audit submission to ed provides comfort to our higher education institution clients that we are in compliance with the thirdparty servicer regulations that may apply to us we also provide this compliance audit report to clients upon request to help them fulfill their compliance audit obligations as title iv participating institutions  table of contents   under ed’s regulations a third party servicer that contracts with a title iv institution acts in the nature of a fiduciary in the administration of title iv programs among other requirements the regulations provide that a thirdparty servicer is jointly and severally liable with its client institution for any liability to ed arising out of the servicer’s violation of title iv or its implementing regulations which could subject us to material fines related to acts or omissions of entities beyond our control ed is also empowered to limit suspend or terminate the violating servicer’s eligibility to act as a thirdparty servicer and to impose significant civil penalties on the violating servicer   additionally on behalf of our higher education institution clients we are required to comply with ed’s cash management regulations regarding payment of financial aid credit balances to students and providing bank accounts to students that may be used for receiving such payments in the event ed concluded that we had violated title iv or its implementing regulations and should be subject to one or more of these sanctions our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected there is limited enforcement and interpretive history of title iv regulations on may   ed published its notice of proposed rulemaking or nprm on program integrity and improvement issues final rules relating to title iv cash management were published in the federal register on october   the final rules included among others provisions related to i restrictions on the ability of higher education institutions and third party servicers like us to market financial products to students including sending unsolicited debit cards to students ii prohibitions on the assessment of certain types of account fees on student account holders and iii requirements related to atm access for student account holders that became effective as of july   although the complete impact of the final rules are unknown there could be a significant negative impact on the disbursement business and in turn customers’ business   ferpa our higher education institution clients are subject to ferpa which provides with certain exceptions that an educational institution that receives any federal funding under a program administered by ed may not have a policy or practice of disclosing education records or “personally identifiable information” from education records other than directory information to third parties without the student’s or parent’s written consent our higher education institution clients that use the disbursement business services disclose to us certain nondirectory information concerning their students including contact information student identification numbers and the amount of students’ credit balances we believe that our higher education institution clients may disclose this information to us without the students’ or their parents’ consent pursuant to one or more exceptions under ferpa however if ed asserts that we do not fall into one of these exceptions or if future changes to legislation or regulations require student consent before our higher education institution clients can disclose this information to us a sizable number of students may cease using our products and services which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   additionally as we are indirectly subject to ferpa we may not permit the transfer of any personally identifiable information to another party other than in a manner in which a higher education institution may disclose it in the event that we redisclose student information in violation of this requirement ferpa requires our clients to suspend our access to any such information for a period of five years any such suspension could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations state laws we may also be subject to similar state laws and regulations including those that restrict higher education institutions from disclosing certain personally identifiable information of students state attorneys general and other enforcement agencies may monitor our compliance with state and federal laws and regulations that affect our business including those pertaining to higher education and banking and conduct investigations of our business that are time consuming and expensive and could result in fines and penalties that have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   additionally individual state legislatures may propose and enact new laws that restrict or otherwise affect our ability to offer our products and services as we currently do which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations reviews performed by the internal revenue service and state taxing authorities for the fiscal years that remain open for investigation may result in a change to income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our results of operations   the bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of various states primarily in the midatlantic region of the united states years that remain open for potential review by  the internal revenue service are  through  and  state taxing authorities are  through  the results of these reviews could result in increased recognition of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements as well as possible fines and penalties  table of contents our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in us and nonus tax and other laws and regulations the us congress and the administration have indicated an interest in reforming the us corporate income tax code possible approaches include lowering the  percent corporate tax rate modifying the taxation of income earned outside the us and limiting or eliminating various other deductions tax credits andor other tax preferences it is not possible at this time to quantify either the onetime impacts from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might result upon tax reform enactment or the ongoing impacts reform proposals might have on income tax expense we will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements if we exceed  billion in assets based on our current total assets and growth strategy we anticipate our bank’s total assets will exceed  billion in the near future the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with  billion or more in total assets including compliance with portions of the federal reserve’s enhanced prudential oversight requirements and annual stress testing requirements in addition banks with  billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations currently our bank is subject to regulations adopted by the cfpb but the federal reserve is primarily responsible for examining our bank’s compliance with consumer protection laws and those cfpb regulations as a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices there is uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business compliance with these requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel design and implement additional internal controls or incur other significant expenses any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations compliance with the annual stress testing requirements part of which must be publicly disclosed may also be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and as a result may adversely affect our stock price or our ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities to ensure compliance with these heightened requirements when effective our regulators may require us to fully comply with these requirements or take actions to prepare for compliance even before our or our bank’s total assets equal or exceed  billion as a result we may incur compliancerelated costs before we might otherwise be required including if we do not continue to grow at the rate we expect or at all our regulators may also consider our preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make even requests for approvals on unrelated matters risks relating to our securities risks relating to our voting common stock the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies although the shares of our common stock are listed on the new york stock exchange the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our voting common stock at any given time which presence will be dependent upon the individual decisions of investors over which we have no control illiquidity of the stock market or in the trading of our common stock on the new york stock exchange could have a material adverse effect on the value of your shares particularly if significant sales of our voting common stock or the expectation of significant sales were to occur we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our voting common stock in the foreseeable future and our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations we have not historically declared nor paid cash dividends on our voting common stock and we do not expect to do so in the near future any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors including earnings and financial condition liquidity and capital requirements the general economic and regulatory climate ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the voting common stock and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors we must be current in the payment of dividends payable to holders of our series c series d series e and series f preferred stock before any dividends can be paid on our common stock  table of contents in addition as a bank holding company we are subject to general regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business which depending on the financial condition and liquidity of the holding company at the time could include the payment of dividends further various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiaries can pay to us as its holding company without regulatory approval see “market price of common stock and dividends – dividends on voting common stock” below for further detail regarding restrictions on our ability to pay dividends we may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future which could adversely affect the value or voting power of the voting common stock actual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the future could cause the value of our voting common stock to decline significantly and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate the issuance of any shares of our common stock in the future also would and equityrelated securities could dilute the percentage ownership interest held by shareholders prior to such issuance actual issuances of our voting common stock could also significantly dilute the voting power of the voting common stock in  we issued  shares of voting common stock in public offerings we have also made grants of restricted stock units and stock options with respect to shares of voting common stock to our directors and certain employees we may also issue further equitybased awards in the future as such shares are issued upon vesting and as such options may be exercised and the underlying shares are or become freely tradeable the value or voting power of our voting common stock may be adversely affected and our ability to sell more equity or equityrelated securities could also be adversely affected except for  warrants held by certain investors at december    we are not required to issue any additional equity securities to existing holders of our voting common stock on a preemptive basis therefore additional common stock issuances directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities warrants or options will generally dilute the holdings of our existing holders of voting common stock and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of our voting common stock our outstanding preferred stock has preference on distribution payments periodically or upon liquidation which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make distributions to holders of our voting common stock because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control the amount timing nature or success of our future capital raising efforts is uncertain thus holders of our voting common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the value of our voting common stock future issuances of debt securities which would rank senior to our voting common stock upon our liquidation and future issuances of equity securities which would dilute the holdings of our existing holders of voting common stock and may be senior to our voting common stock for the purposes of making distributions periodically or upon liquidation may negatively affect the market price of our voting common stock in the future we may issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings upon our liquidation holders of our debt securities and other loans and preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before holders of our voting common stock if we incur debt in the future our future interest costs could increase and adversely affect our liquidity cash flows and results of operations provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of us which could discourage transactions that would otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders and could entrench management provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of pennsylvania law and the federal change in bank control act may delay inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of our business through a tender offer business combination proxy contest or some other method even though some of our shareholders might believe a change in control is desirable they might also increase the costs of completing a transaction in which we acquire another financial services business merge with another financial institution or sell our business to another financial institution these increased costs could reduce the value of the shares held by our shareholders upon completion of these types of transactions  table of contents shareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us and our bank subsidiaries which could impose prior approval requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders we are a bank holding company regulated by the federal reserve any entity including a “group” composed of natural persons owning  or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock or a lesser percentage if such holder or group otherwise exercises a “controlling influence” over us may be subject to regulation as a “bank holding company” in accordance with the bank holding company act of  as amended the “bhca” in addition  any bank holding company or foreign bank with a us presence is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve under the bhca to acquire or retain  or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock and  any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain prior regulatory approval under the change in bank control act to acquire or retain  or more of our outstanding shares of voting stock any shareholder that is deemed to “control” the company for bank regulatory purposes would become subject to prior approval requirements and ongoing regulation and supervision such a holder may be required to divest amounts equal to or exceeding  of the voting shares of investments that may be deemed incompatible with bank holding company status such as an investment in a company engaged in nonfinancial activities regulatory determination of “control” of a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements our common stock owned by holders determined by a bank regulatory agency to be acting in concert would be aggregated for purposes of determining whether those holders have control of a bank or bank holding company each shareholder obtaining control that is a “company” would be required to register as a bank holding company “acting in concert” generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company whether or not pursuant to an express agreement the manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty many factors can lead to a finding of acting in concert including where i the shareholders are commonly controlled or managed ii the shareholders are parties to an oral or written agreement or understanding regarding the acquisition voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company iii the shareholders each own stock in a bank and are also management officials controlling shareholders partners or trustees of another company or iv both a shareholder and a controlling shareholder partner trustee or management official of such shareholder own equity in the bank or bank holding company the fdic’s policy statement imposing restrictions and criteria on private investors in failed bank acquisitions will apply to us and our investors on august   the fdic issued a policy statement imposing restrictions and criteria on private investors in failed bank acquisitions the policy statement is broad in scope and both complex and potentially ambiguous in its application in most cases it would apply to an investor with more than  of the total voting power of an acquired depository institution or its holding company but in certain circumstances it could apply to investors holding fewer voting shares the policy statement will be applied to us if we make additional failed bank acquisitions from the fdic or if the fdic changes its interpretation of the policy statement or determines at some future date that it should be applied because of our circumstances investors subject to the policy statement could be prohibited from selling or transferring their interests for three years they also would be required to provide the fdic with information about the investor and all entities in the investor’s ownership chain including information on the size of the capital fund or funds its diversification its return profile its marketing documents and its management team and business model investors owning  or more of two or more banks or savings associations would be required to pledge their proportionate interests in each institution to crossguarantee the fdic against losses to the deposit insurance fund under the policy statement the fdic also could prohibit investment through ownership structures involving multiple investment vehicles that are owned or controlled by the same parent company investors that directly or indirectly hold  or more of the equity of a bank or savings association in receivership also would not be eligible to bid to become investors in the deposit liabilities of that failed institution in addition an investor using ownership structures with entities that are domiciled in bank secrecy jurisdictions would not be eligible to own a direct or indirect interest in an insured depository institution unless the investor’s parent company is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision as recognized by the federal reserve and the investor enters into certain agreements with the us bank regulators regarding access to information maintenance of records and compliance with us banking laws and regulations if the policy statement applies we including any failed bank we acquire could be required to maintain a ratio of tier  common equity to total assets of at least  for a period of  years and thereafter maintain a capital level

contents item         management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with “business – executive summary” and the bancorp’s consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december    certain amounts reported in the  and  financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the  presentation these reclassifications did not significantly impact customers financial position or results of operations critical accounting policies customers has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its financial statements customers significant accounting policies are described in note   significant accounting policies and basis of presentation to its audited financial statements certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by customers that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities customers considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies the judgment and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions management makes actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material impact on the carrying values of customers assets and liabilities and results of operations the following is a summary of the policies customers recognizes as involving critical accounting estimates allowance for loan losses stockbased compensation unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities and otherthantemporary impairment analysis fair values of financial instruments accounting for purchasedcreditimpaired pci loans deferred income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets allowance for loan losses   customers maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses incurred as of the report date management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors however this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including historical losses peer and industry data current economic conditions the size and composition of the loan portfolio delinquency statistics criticized and classified assets and impaired loans results of internal loan reviews borrowers’ perceived financial and management strengths the adequacy of underlying collateral the dependence on collateral or the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors these factors may be susceptible to significant change to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates additional provisions for loan losses may be required which may adversely affect customers results of operations in the future subsequent to the acquisition of purchasedcreditimpaired loans estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on updated assumptions regarding default rates loss severities and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses subsequent increases in expected cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges stockbased compensation   customers recognizes compensation expense for sharebased awards in accordance with asc  compensation – stock compensation expense related to stock option awards is based on the fair value of the option at the grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period for performance based awards compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period as long as it remains probable that the performance conditions will be met if the service or performance conditions are not met customers reverses previously recorded compensation expense upon forfeiture customers utilizes the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant the blackscholes model takes into consideration the exercise price of the option the expected life of the option the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility expected dividends on the stock and the current riskfree interest rate for the expected life of the option customers estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from its limited historical experience and may not necessarily equate to market value when fully vested  table of contents unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and otherthantemporary impairment analysis customers receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers in developing these fair values the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments debt securities available for sale consist primarily of mortgagebacked securities issued by us governmentsponsored agencies customers uses various indicators in determining whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired including for debt securities when it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected or for equity securities whether the market value is below its cost for an extended period of time with low expectation of recovery the debt securities are monitored for changes in credit ratings because adverse changes in credit ratings could indicate a change in the estimated cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer  for marketable equity securities customers considers the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and near term prospects to determine whether an impairment is temporary or otherthantemporary customers also considers the volatility of a security’s price in comparison to the market as a whole and any recoveries or declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date if management determines that the impairment is otherthantemporary the entire amount of the impairment as of the balance sheet date is recognized in earnings even if the decision to sell the security has not been made the fair value of the security becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment and is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value at december   management evaluated its availableforsale debt securities for otherthantemporary impairment the unrealized losses associated with the availableforsale debt securities were not considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired at december   because the losses were related to changes in interest rates and did not affect the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer customers does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that customers will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis at december   management evaluated its equity holdings issued by a foreign entity for otherthantemporary impairment management determined it no longer had the intent to hold the securities until a recovery in fair value accordingly customers recognized an otherthantemporarily impairment loss of  million on these securities for the year ended december    fair value   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants other than in a forced or liquidation sale as of the measurement date also referred to as an exit price management estimates the fair values of financial instruments using a variety of valuation methods when financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices the quoted market prices are used for fair value when the financial instruments are not actively traded other observable market inputs such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics may be used if available to determine fair value when observable market prices do not exist customers estimates fair value using unobservable data the valuation methods and inputs consider factors such as types of underlying assets or liabilities rates of estimated credit losses interest rates or discount rates and collateral the best estimate of fair value involves assumptions including but not limited to various performance indicators such as historical and projected default and recovery rates credit ratings current delinquency rates loantovalue ratios and the possibility of obligor refinancing us gaap requires the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities as well as for specific disclosures the most significant uses of fair values include residential mortgage loans acquired subject to an agreement to resell residential mortgage loans originated with an intent to sell availableforsale investment securities derivative assets and liabilities impaired loans and foreclosed property and the net assets acquired in business combinations for additional information refer to note  – disclosures about fair value of financial instruments purchased creditimpaired loans for certain acquired loans that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality customers follows the guidance contained in asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  purchased creditimpaired loans are loans that were acquired in business combinations or asset purchases with evidence of credit deterioration since origination to the date acquired and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired evidence of credit quality deterioration as of purchase dates may include information such as pastdue and nonaccrual status borrower credit scores and recent loan to value percentages the fair value of loans with evidence of credit deterioration is recorded net of a nonaccretable difference and if appropriate an accretable yield the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is the nonaccretable difference which is not included in the carrying amount of acquired loans  table of contents subsequent to acquisition estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on updated assumptions regarding default rates loss severities and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions subsequent decreases in the estimated cash flows of the loan will generally result in a provision for loan losses subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from nonaccretable to accretable with a positive impact on accretion of interest income in future periods further any excess of cash flows expected at the time of acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of those cash flows purchasedcreditimpaired loans acquired may be aggregated into one or more pools provided that the loans have common risk characteristics a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows on a quarterly basis the bank reestimates the total cash flows both principal and interest expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool these estimates incorporate assumptions regarding default rates loss severities the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect thencurrent market conditions if the timing andor amounts of expected cash flows on purchasedcreditimpaired loans were determined not to be reasonably estimable no interest would be accreted and the loans would be reported as nonaccrual loans however when the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for purchasedcreditimpaired loans are reasonably estimable interest is being accreted and the loans are being reported as performing loans chargeoffs are not recorded on purchasedcreditimpaired loans until actual losses exceed the estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at acquisition date deferred income taxes   customers provides for deferred income taxes on the liability method whereby tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax basis deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights intangible assets that have finite lives such as customer and university relationship intangibles and noncompete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic impairment testing goodwill and other intangible assets recognized as part of the disbursement business acquisition were based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price in fourth quarter  customers recorded adjustments to the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired which resulted in a  million increase in goodwill for more information regarding the net assets acquired and goodwill recorded upon acquisition of the disbursement business see note   acquisition activity goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually as of october  and between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment of goodwill is a condition that exists when the carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value a qualitative factor test can be performed to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative impairment test if the results of the qualitative review indicate that it is unlikely less than  probability that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value no further evaluation needs to be performed intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment under asc  which requires that a longlived asset or asset group be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  table of contents overview like most financial institutions customers derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interestearning assets such as loans and investments customers primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is its deposits on which it pays interest consequently one of the key measures of customers success is the amount of net interest income or the difference between the income on its interestearning assets and the expense on its interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings another key measure is the spread between the yield earned on these interestearning assets and the rate paid on these interestbearing liabilities which is referred to as net interest spread there is credit risk inherent in all loans so customers maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible customers maintains this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against its operating earnings customers has included a detailed discussion of this process as well as several tables describing its allowance for loan losses bankmobile a division of customers bank derives the majority of its revenue from interchange and card revenue earned from the disbursement business acquired from higher one in fourth quarter  customers decided to sell bankmobile and anticipates the sale to close in third quarter  accordingly bankmobile has been classified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets and bankmobiles operating results have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  economic outlook us real gdp is forecast to grow  to  during   additionally a dichotomy could develop between the us and global economies as a result of president trump’s policies eg higher tariffs on trade curbing illegal immigration increased federal stimulus and tax cuts for corporations and americans with the us getting a shortterm pickup in gdp growth while global growth is dampened by us economic policy sectors tied closely to the domestic economy should fare better than those sectors that are more closely tied to the global economy  the us economy is forecast to expand  in  from around  in  as consumer spending is bolstered by healthy employment and wage prospects despite continued weak business investment while inflation has remained below the federal reserves target of   through the  months ended november   as published by the us government on december   it is expected to climb to  in  and  in  if current projections are correct it would be the first stretch of sustained inflation above  since before the recession of  to  since “lift off” in middecember  and an additional  basis points interest rate increase in middecember  it is expected that the federal reserve will continue to raise the overnight rate increasing it three times during   for these interest rate hikes to occur the cpi and pce deflators will need to continue to approach the federal reserves  target and employment will need to improve or at least retain recent positive trends while the outlook in the us remains optimistic in the short run the trump administration’s policies are likely to result in higher us interest rates and a stronger dollar which could have a significantly adverse impact on the global economy in the longer run however these policies could also have a negative impact on us growth as the boost from the fiscal stimulus diminishes and president trump’s other policies eg higher tariffs curtailed immigration and tighter monetary policy by the federal reserve ultimately begin to weigh on domestic growth  in customers bancorps market area management sees continued moderate  to  growth in  the housing market continuing to improve and unemployment improving or at least remaining at current levels during the year management is seeing improvement in loan demand in the banks commercial and industrial multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolios although the market for multifamily loans is expected to be down by  to  in  with the bank being down approximately  because it is better positioned than the large banks with exposure to a lot of potential refinance activity as the trump administration is only beginning to take shape the political uncertainty in the us and the challenges associated with that uncertainty will continue over the next few years overall management is optimistic that  will show a continuation of the improving economic environment experienced in  providing the caveat that the political uncertainty surrounding the trump administration’s ability to execute its policies could have a significant impact on the continued economic recovery  table of contents results of operations the following discussion of customers bancorp’s consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements including the accompanying notes also see critical accounting policies” and “note   significant accounting policies and basis of presentation” for information concerning certain significant accounting policies and estimates applied in determining reported results of operations for the years ended december   and  net income available to common shareholders increased  million  or   to  million for the year ended december    compared to  million for the year ended december    the increased net income available to common

increases in noninterest expense of  million  tax expense of  million  net loss from discontinued operations of  million  and preferred stock dividends of  million  net interest income from continuing operations increased  million  or   for the year ended december   to  million  compared to  million for the year ended december    the increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in the

for loan losses from continuing operations declined  million to  million for the year ended december    compared to  million for the same period in   the decrease in the provision for loan losses during  was primarily attributable to a provision expense of  million recorded in  for a fraudulent loan that was charged off in its entirety during  greater growth in loans held for investment in  as compared to  a benefit of  million in  attributable to fdic loss sharing arrangements versus expense of  million in  and recoveries totaling  million in  compared to recoveries of  million in  noninterest income from continuing operations declined  million  or   for the year ended december   to  million  compared to  million for the year ended december    the decrease resulted primarily from an impairment charge of  million recorded in  due to customers change in intent to hold certain equity securities until the market price of the securities recovered and a decrease in bankowned life insurance income of  million as a result of a  million benefit received on a bankowned life insurance policy in  these decreases were offset in part by increased mortgage warehouse transactional fees of  million resulting from higher transaction volumes in  as compared to  and a  million recovery of a previously recorded loss during  noninterest expense from continuing operations increased  million  or   during the year ended december   to  million  compared to  million during the year ended december    the increase was primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits of  million  technology communications and bank operations of  million  fdic assessments nonincome taxes and regulatory fees of  million  professional services of  million  occupancy expenses of  million  and onetime charges of  million associated with legal matters much of the increased noninterest expense was attributable to the increased level of staff and other operating expenses necessary to support and operate a  billion bank income tax expense from continuing operations increased  million for the year ended december   to  million  compared to  million in the same period in   the increase in income tax expense was driven primarily from increased pretax income of  million in  and an increase in our effective tax rate of  partially offset by the early adoption of asu  improvements to employee share based accounting  which decreased income tax expense by  million for the year ended december    the loss from discontinued operations increased  million for the year ended december   to  million  compared to  million in the same period in  the increase was primarily driven by additional expenses realized as a result of the acquisition of the disbursement business in june  the loss from discontinued operations provided a tax benefit of  million for the year ended december    compared to  million for the same period of   preferred stock dividends increased

the net margin decrease was largely a result of the growth in the lower yielding mortgage warehouse portfolio the provision for loan losses increased  million to  million for the year ended december

evaluated for impairment the collateral value or discounted cash flow analysis is used to determine the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and compared net of estimated selling costs to the outstanding loan balance to measure a specific reserve appraisals used in this evaluation process are typically less than two years aged for loans where real estate is not the primary source of collateral updated financial information is obtained including accounts receivable and inventory aging reports and relevant supplemental financial data to estimate the fair value of the loan and compared net of estimated selling costs to the outstanding loan balance to estimate the required reserve these impairment measurements are inherently subjective as they require material estimates including among others estimates of property values in appraisals the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on individual loans and general considerations for historical loss experience economic conditions uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios all of which require judgment and may be susceptible to significant change over time and as a result of changing economic conditions or other factors pursuant to asc  loan impairment and asc  troubled debt restructurings by creditors impaired loans consisting primarily of nonaccrual and restructured loans are considered in the methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses impaired loans are generally evaluated based on the expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell if principal repayment is expected to come from the sale or operation of such collateral the following table shows the allowance for loan losses

time of purchase every quarter management reassesses the risk and adjusts the cash flow forecast to incorporate changes in the credit outlook generally a decrease in forecasted cash flows for a purchased loan will result in a provision for loan losses and absent chargeoffs an increase in the allowance for loan losses acquired loans have a significantly higher percentage of nonperforming

practices while various degrees of credit risk are associated with substantially all investing activities the lending function carries the greatest degree of potential loss asset quality assurance activities include careful monitoring of borrower payment status and the periodic review of borrower current financial information to ensure ongoing financial strength and borrower cash flow viability the bank has established credit policies and procedures seeks the consistent application of those policies and procedures across the organization and adjusts policies as appropriate for changes in market conditions and applicable regulations problem loan identification and management to facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial and industrial commercial real estate construction portfolio and residential real estate segments and for purposes of analyzing historical loss rates used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses for the respective portfolio segment customers utilizes the following categories of risk ratings pass there are six risk ratings of pass loans special mention substandard doubtful or loss the risk rating categories which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated regularly thereafter pass ratings which are assigned to those borrowers who do not have an identified potential or welldefined weaknesses and for which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment are updated periodically based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower all other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter while assigning risk ratings involves judgment the risk rating process allows management to identify riskier credits in a timely manner and allocate the appropriate resources to managing the loans customers assigns a special mention rating to loans that have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention if left uncorrected these potential weaknesses may at some future date result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan and our credit position at december   and  special mention loans were  million and  million respectively risk ratings are not established for home equity loans consumer loans and installment loans mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of homogenous loans with smaller balances instead these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based on aggregate payment history through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends  table of contents a regular reporting and review process is in place to provide for proper portfolio oversight and control and to monitor those loans identified as problem credits by management this process is designed to assess our progress in working toward a solution and to assist in determining an appropriate specific allowance for possible losses all loan workout situations involve the active participation of management and are reported regularly to the board when a loan becomes delinquent  days or more or earlier if considered appropriate the loan is assigned to customers’ special asset group “sag” for workout or other resolution loan chargeoffs are determined on a casebycase basis loans are generally charged off when principal is likely to be unrecoverable and after appropriate collection steps have been taken loan chargeoffs are proposed by the sag and approved by the board of directors loan policies and procedures are reviewed internally for possible revisions and changes on a regular basis in addition these policies and procedures together with the loan portfolio are reviewed on a periodic basis by

to determine whether they should be placed on nonaccrual status in subsequent years a tdr may be returned to accrual status if the borrower satisfies a minimum six month performance requirement however it will remain classified as impaired generally the bank requires sustained performance for nine months before returning a tdr to accrual status modification of purchasedcreditimpaired loans that are accounted for within loan pools in accordance with the accounting standards for purchasedcreditimpaired loans do not result in the removal of these loans from the pool even if modifications would otherwise be considered a tdr accordingly as each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an expectation of cash flows modifications of loans within

instruments involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheets with commitments to extend credit exposures to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments the same credit policies are used in making commitments and conditional obligations as for onbalance sheet instruments because they involve credit risk similar to extending a loan these financial instruments are subject to the bank’s credit policy and other underwriting standards as of december   and   the following offbalance sheet commitments financial instruments and other arrangements were outstanding   december        amounts in thousands   commitments to fund loans       unfunded commitments to fund mortgage warehouse loans     unfunded commitments under lines of credit     letters of credit     commitments to fund loans unfunded commitments to fund mortgage warehouse loans unfunded commitments under lines of credit and letters of credit are agreements to extend credit to or for the benefit of a customer in the ordinary course of our business  table of contents commitments to fund loans and unfunded commitments under lines of credit may be obligations of ours as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee we evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a casebycase basis the amount of collateral obtained if we deem it necessary upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate accounts receivable inventory and equipment mortgage warehouse loan commitments are agreements to fund the pipelines of mortgage banking businesses from closing of individual mortgage loans until their sale into the secondary market most of the individual mortgage loans are insured or guaranteed by the us government through one of their programs such as fha va or are conventional loans eligible for sale to fannie mae and freddie mac these commitments generally fluctuate monthly based on changes in interest rates refinance activity new home sales and laws and regulation outstanding letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party letters of credit may obligate us to fund draws under those letters of credit whether or not a customer continues to meet the conditions of the extension of credit the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers contractual obligations

accounting policies and basis of presentation”  table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the largest component of our net income is net interest income and the majority of our financial instruments are interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various term structures and maturities one of the primary objectives of management is to maximize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities loan prepayments deposit withdrawals and differences in lending and funding rates our assetliability committee actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities we use two complementary methods to analyze and measure interest rate sensitivity as part of the overall management of interest rate risk they are income simulation modeling and estimates of economic value of equity the combination of these two methods provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the levels of interest rate risk of our exposure to time factors and changes in interest rate environments income simulation modeling is used to measure our interest rate sensitivity and manage our interest rate risk income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates upon forecasted net interest income but also other factors such as yield curve relationships the volume and mix of assets and liabilities customer preferences and general market conditions through the use of income simulation modeling we have estimated the net interest income for the year ending december   based upon the assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments in existence at december    we have also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon interest rates rising or falling immediately “rate shocks” for upward rate shocks modeling a rising rate environment current market interest rates were increased immediately by   and  basis points for downward rate shocks modeling a falling rate environment current market rates were only decreased immediately by  basis points due to the limitations of the current low interest rate environment that renders the down  and down  rate shocks impractical the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the year ending december   resulting from changes in interest rates net change in net interest income rate shocks  change up     up     up     down    the net changes in net interest income in all scenarios are within customers bank’s interest rate risk policy guidelines economic value of equity “eve” estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows discount rates are based upon market prices for comparable assets and liabilities upward and downward rate shocks are used to measure volatility of eve in relation to a constant rate environment  for upward rate shocks modeling a rising rate environment current market interest rates were increased immediately by   and  basis points for downward rate shocks modeling a falling rate environment current market rates were only decreased immediately by  basis points due to the limitations of the current low interest rate environment that renders the down  and down  rate shocks impractical this method of measurement primarily evaluates the longer term repricing risks and options in customers bank’s balance sheet the following table reflects the estimated eve at risk and the ratio of eve to eve adjusted assets at december   resulting from shocks to interest rates    table of contents the following table reflects the estimated eve at risk and the ratio of eve to eve adjusted assets at december    resulting from the referenced shocks to interest rates   rate shocks from base up    up    up    down     the net changes in economic value of equity in all scenarios are within customers bank’s interest rate risk policy guidelines the matching of assets and liabilities may also be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank’s interest rate sensitivity “gap” an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period the following table sets forth the amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are anticipated based upon certain assumptions to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown except as stated below the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a threemonth period and subsequent selected time intervals the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be repaid andor repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable and fixed rate loans and as a result of contractualrate adjustments on adjustablerate loans    table of contents balance sheet gap

cumulative interestbearing liabilities                           a including loans held for sale as shown above we have a positive cumulative gap cumulative interest sensitive assets are higher than cumulative interest sensitive liabilities within the next year which generally indicates that an increase in rates may lead to an increase in net interest income and a decrease in rates may lead to a decrease in net interest income interest rate sensitivity gap analysis measures whether assets or liabilities may reprice but does not capture the ability to reprice or the range of potential repricing on assets or liabilities thus indications based on a negative or positive gap position need to be analyzed in conjunction with other interest rate risk management tools management believes that the assumptions and combination of methods utilized in evaluating estimated net interest income are reasonable however the interest rate sensitivity of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience

required management to make estimates about discount rates future expected cash flows market conditions and other future events that were highly subjective and subject to change the fair value estimates were considered preliminary and subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information became available based on a preliminary purchase price allocation customers recorded  million in goodwill as a result of the acquisition at december   customers recorded adjustments to the estimated fair values of prepaid expenses and other liabilities which resulted in a  million increase in goodwill the adjusted amount of goodwill of  million reflects the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired the goodwill recorded is deductible for tax purposes customers does not anticipate any additional adjustments to the purchase price allocation the fair value for the developed software was estimated

combinations business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method in accordance with accountings standards codification asc  business combinations  under the acquisition method identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition and are recognized separately from goodwill results of operations of the acquired entity are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition  table of contents investment securities customers acquires securities largely mortgagebacked securities to effectively utilize cash and capital and to generate earnings security transactions are recorded as of the trade date securities are classified at the time of acquisition as available for sale held to maturity or trading and their classification determines the accounting as follows available for sale  investment securities classified as available for sale are those debt and equity securities that customers intends to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily to maturity investment securities available for sale are carried at fair value unrealized gains or losses are reported as increases or decreases in accumulated other comprehensive income net of the related deferred tax effect realized gains or losses determined on the basis of the cost of the specific securities sold are included in earnings and recorded at the trade date premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities held to maturity  investment securities classified as held to maturity are those debt securities that customers has both the intent and ability to hold to maturity regardless of changes in market conditions liquidity needs or changes in general economic conditions these securities are carried at cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts computed by a method which approximates the interest method over the terms of the securities there were no securities classified as held to maturity as of december   and   trading investment securities classified as trading are those debt and equity securities that management intends to actively trade these securities are carried at their current fair value with changes in fair value reported in income customers does not actively trade securities for availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities management periodically assesses whether the securities are other than temporarily impaired otherthantemporary impairment means that management believes a security’s decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis is due to factors that could include the issuer’s inability to pay interest or dividends its potential for default andor other factors when a heldtomaturity or availableforsale debt security is assessed for otherthantemporary impairment management has to first consider a whether customers intends to sell the security and b whether it is more likely than not that customers will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis if one of these circumstances applies to a security an otherthantemporary impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income equal to the full amount of the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis if neither of these circumstances applies to a security but customers does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred that must be separated into two categories for debt securities a the amount related to credit loss and b the amount related to other factors in assessing the level of otherthantemporary impairment attributable to credit loss management compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected with the amortized cost basis of the security the portion of the total otherthantemporary impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings as the difference between the fair value and the present value of the estimated cash flows while the amount related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income the total otherthantemporary impairment loss is presented in the statement of income less the portion recognized in other comprehensive income when a debt security becomes otherthantemporarily impaired its amortized cost basis is reduced to reflect the portion of the total impairment related to credit loss for marketable equity securities customers considers the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and near term prospects to determine whether an impairment is temporary or otherthantemporary customers also considers the volatility of a security’s price in comparison to the market as a whole and any recoveries or declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date if management determines that the impairment is otherthantemporary the entire amount of the impairment as of the balance sheet date is recognized in earnings even if the decision to sell the security has not been made the fair value of the security becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment and is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value  table of contents loan accounting framework the accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan and on whether the loan was credit impaired at the date of acquisition the bank accounts for loans based on the following categories   • loans held for sale • loans at fair value • loans receivable • purchased loans • loans receivable covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic the following provides a detailed discussion of the accounting for loans in these categories loans held for sale and loans at fair value loans originated or acquired by the bank with the intent to sell in the secondary market are carried either at the lower of cost or fair value determined in the aggregate or at fair value depending upon an election made at the time the loan is made these loans are generally sold on a nonrecourse basis with servicing released gains and losses on the sale of loans accounted for at lower of cost or fair value are recognized in earnings based on the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the loans inclusive of deferred origination fees and costs if any as a result of changes in events and circumstances or developments regarding management’s view of the foreseeable future loans not originated or acquired with the intent to sell may subsequently be designated as held for sale these loans are transferred to the heldforsale portfolio at the lower of amortized cost or fair value loans originated or acquired by the bank with the intent to sell for which fair value accounting is elected are reported at fair valuewith changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period they occur upon sale any difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the loan is recognized in earnings no fees or costs related to such loans are deferred so they do not affect the gain or loss calculation at the time of sale certain mortgage warehouse lending transactions subject to master repurchase agreements are designated as held for sale and reported at fair value based on an election made to account for the loans at fair value pursuant to these agreements the bank funds the pipelines for these mortgage lenders by sending payments directly to the closing agents for funded loans ie the purchase event and receives proceeds directly from third party investors when the loans are sold into the secondary market ie the repurchase event an allowance for loan losses is not maintained on loans designated as held for sale or reported at fair value loans receivable loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances net of an allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance loan origination fees net of certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the yield interest income of the related loans using the levelyield method without anticipating prepayments the bank is generally amortizing these amounts over the contractual life of the loans the accrual of interest is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become  days past due or when management has doubts about further collectibility of principal or interest even though the loan is currently performing a loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is well secured when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status unpaid accrued interest previously credited to income is reversed interest received on nonaccrual loans is applied against principal until all principal has been recovered thereafter payments are recognized as interest income until all unpaid amounts have been received generally loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current and has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a minimum of six months and the ultimate collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt  table of contents transfers of financial assets including loan participations sold are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered settlement date control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when  the assets have been isolated from the bank  the transferee obtains the right free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and  the bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity purchased loans customers believes that the varying circumstances under which it purchases loans and the diverse credit quality of loans purchased should drive the decision as to whether loans in a portfolio should be deemed to be purchasedcreditimpaired loans therefore loan purchases are evaluated on a casebycase basis to determine the appropriate accounting treatment loans acquired that do not have evidence of credit deterioration at the purchase date are accounted for in accordance with asc  nonrefundable fees and other costs and loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are accounted for in accordance with asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality loans that are purchased that do not have evidence of credit deterioration purchased performing loans are initially recorded at fair value and include credit and interest rate marks associated with acquisition accounting adjustments purchase premiums or discounts are subsequently amortized as an adjustment to yield over the estimated contractual lives of the loans there is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date for acquired performing loans an allowance for loan losses is recorded for any credit deterioration in these loans subsequent to acquisition loans that are purchased that have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected for purchases of this loan type evidence of deteriorated credit quality may include pastdue and nonaccrual status borrower credit scores and recent loantovalue percentages the fair value of loans with evidence of credit deterioration is recorded net of a nonaccretable difference and accretable yield the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is the nonaccretable difference which is not included in the carrying amount of acquired loans subsequent to acquisition estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on updated assumptions regarding default rates loss severities and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses subsequent increases in expected cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from nonaccretable to accretable with a positive impact on accretion of interest income in future periods further any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of those cash flows purchasedcreditimpaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter may be aggregated into one or more pools provided that the loans have common risk characteristics a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows on a quarterly basis the bank reestimates the total cash flows both principal and interest expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool these estimates incorporate assumptions regarding default rates loss severities the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect thencurrent market conditions if the timing andor amounts of expected cash flows on purchasedcreditimpaired loans were determined not to be reasonably estimable no interest would be accreted and the loans would be reported as nonaccrual loans however when the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for purchasedcreditimpaired loans are reasonably estimable interest is being accreted and the loans are being reported as performing loans loans receivable covered under loss sharing agreements on july   customers entered into an agreement to terminate all existing rights and obligations pursuant to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic in connection with the termination agreement customers paid the fdic  million as final payment under these agreements the negotiated settlement amount was based on net losses incurred on the covered assets through september   adjusted for cash payments to and cash receipts from the fdic as part of the december   and march   certifications consequently loans and other real estate owned previously reported as covered assets pursuant to the loss sharing agreements are no longer reported as covered assets as of june    table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through provisions for loan losses loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to absorb probable incurred loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the reporting date the bank disaggregates its loan portfolio into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for purposes of estimating the allowance for loan losses the bank’s loan groups include multifamily commercial and industrial owner and nonowner occupied commercial real estate construction residential real estate manufactured housing consumer and pci loans the bank further disaggregates its residential real estate portfolio into two classes based upon certain risk characteristics first mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines of credit the remaining loan groups are also considered classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics additionally within each loan group the acquired loans that are accounted for under asc  are further segregated the total allowance for loan losses consists of an allowance for impaired loans a general allowance for losses and may also include residual nonspecific reserve amounts the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that are estimated to have been incurred management performs a quarterly assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which is based on the bank’s past loan loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio current economic conditions peer and industry data and other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available the bank’s current methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss rates peer and industry data current economic conditions risk ratings specific allocations on loans identified as impaired and other qualitative adjustments as considered appropriate the impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses generally relates to loans for which it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due customers analyzes certain loans in its portfolio for impairment in accordance with asc  customers impaired loans generally include loans that have been i placed on nonaccrual ii restructured in a troubled debt restructuring regardless of their payment status and iii chargedoff to their net realizable value for such loans an allowance is established when the i discounted cash flows ii collateral value or iii the impaired loan value is lower than the carrying value of the loan the general component of the allowance for loan losses covers groups of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans such as residential real estate home equity loans home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans these pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon industry peer or customers historical loss rates for each of these groups of loans after determining the appropriate historical loss rate for each group of loans management considers current qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from the historical loss experience the overall effect of these factors is recorded as an adjustment that as appropriate increases or decreases the historical loss rate applied to the loan group the qualitative factors that management generally considers include the following   • national regional and local economic and business conditions including review of changes in the unemployment rate • volume and severity of past due loans and classified loans • lending policies and procedures including underwriting standards and historicalbased losscollection chargeoff and recovery practices • nature and volume of the portfolio including lending concentrations • risk ratings • changes in the values of collateral for collateral dependent loans • experience ability and depth of lending management and staff and • other external factors such as changes in the legal regulatory or competitive environment  table of contents a residual reserve may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses the residual reserve amount reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating historical and projected profitability and cash flow to determine the borrower’s ability to repay their obligation as agreed commercial and industrial loans are made primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral supporting the loan facility accordingly the repayment of a commercial and industrial loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower and any guarantors while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment construction loans are underwritten based upon a financial analysis of the developers and property owners and construction cost estimates in addition to independent appraisal valuations these loans rely on the value associated with the project upon completion these cost and valuation amounts used are estimates and may be inaccurate construction loans generally involve the disbursement of substantial funds over a short period of time with repayment substantially dependent upon the success of the completed project sources of repayment of these loans would be permanent financing upon completion or sales of developed property these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to be of a higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to general economic conditions availability of longterm financing interest rate sensitivity and governmental regulation of real property commercial real estate and multifamily loans are subject to the underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans in addition to those underwriting standards for real estate loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow dependent and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of these loans is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the principal business conducted on the property securing the loan in addition the underwriting considers the amount of the principal advanced relative to the property value commercial real estate and multifamily loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or the economy in general management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate and multifamily loans based on cash flow estimates collateral and riskrating criteria the bank also utilizes thirdparty experts to provide environmental and market valuations substantial effort is required to underwrite monitor and evaluate commercial real estate and multifamily loans residential real estate loans are secured by one to four dwelling units this group is further divided into first mortgage and home equity loans first mortgages are originated at a loan to value ratio of  or less home equity loans have additional risks as a result of typically being in a second position or lower in the event collateral is liquidated manufactured housing loans represent loans that are secured by the manufactured housing unit where the borrower may or may not own the underlying real estate and therefore have a higher risk than a residential real estate loan other consumer loans consist of loans to individuals originated through the bank’s retail network and are typically unsecured or secured by personal property consumer loans have a greater credit risk than residential loans because of the difference in the underlying collateral if any the application of various federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans delinquency status and other borrower characteristics are used to monitor loans and identify credit risks and the general reserves are established based on the expected net chargeoffs adjusted for qualitative factors chargeoffs on commercial and industrial construction multifamily and commercial real estate loans are recorded when management estimates that there are insufficient cash flows to repay the contractual loan obligation based upon financial information available and valuation of the underlying collateral  shortfalls in the underlying collateral value for loans determined to be collateral dependent are chargedoff immediately  table of contents the bank also takes into account the strength of any guarantees and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate chargeoff or reserve associated with an impaired loan accordingly the bank may chargeoff a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value alternatively the bank may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value in certain circumstances such as when the bank has a guarantee from a borrower that the bank believes has realizable value in evaluating the strength of any guarantee the bank evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor the guarantor’s reputation and the guarantor’s willingness and desire to work with the bank the bank then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant the bank records chargeoffs for residential real estate consumer and manufactured housing loans after  days of delinquency or sooner when cash flows are determined to be insufficient for repayment the bank may also chargeoff these loans below the net appraised valuation if the bank holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions in such cases the bank may abandon its junior mortgage and chargeoff the loan balance in full estimates of cash flows expected to be collected for purchased credit impaired loans are updated each reporting period if the bank estimates decreases in expected cash flows to be collected after acquisition the bank charges the provision for loan losses and establishes an allowance for loan losses credit quality factors commercial and industrial multifamily commercial real estate residential real estate and construction loans are each assigned a numerical rating of risk based on an internal risk rating system the risk rating is assigned at loan origination and indicates managements estimate of credit quality risk ratings are reviewed on a periodic or “as needed” basis consumer and manufactured housing loans are evaluated primarily based on the payment activity of the loan risk ratings are not established for home equity loans consumer loans manufactured housing loans and installment loans mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of homogeneous loans with smaller balances instead these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based on aggregate payment history through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends for additional information about credit quality factor ratings refer to note  – loans receivable and allowance for loan losses impaired loans a loan is generally considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  customers impaired loans generally include loans that have been i placed on nonaccrual ii restructured in a troubled debt restructuring regardless of their payment status and iii chargedoff to their net realizable value factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower including the length of the delay the reasons for the delay the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed impairment is generally measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent the fair value of the collateral is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans less estimated costs to sell collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment inventory and accounts receivable the vast majority of the banks collateral is real estate the value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing an income or market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent licensed appraiser outside of the bank using observable market data the value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant or the net book value on the applicable business’ financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data likewise values for inventory and accounts receivable collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports  table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights intangible assets that have finite lives such as customer and university relationship intangibles and noncompete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing goodwill and other intangible assets recognized as part of the disbursement business acquisition were based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price in fourth quarter  customers recorded adjustments to the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired which resulted in a  million increase in goodwill for more information regarding the net assets acquired and goodwill recorded upon acquisition of the disbursement business see note   acquisition activity goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually as of october  and between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment of goodwill is a condition that exists when the carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value a qualitative factor test can be performed to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative impairment test if the results of the qualitative review indicate that it is unlikely less than  probability that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value no further evaluation needs to be performed intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment under asc  which requires that a longlived asset or asset group be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset as part of its qualitative assessment customers reviewed regional and national trends in current and expected economic conditions examining indicators such as gdp growth interest rates and unemployment rates customers also considered its own historical performance expectations of future performance and other trends specific to the banking industry based on its qualitative assessment customers determined that there was no evidence of impairment on the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   and   goodwill and other intangible assets totaled   million and  million  respectively from continuing operations goodwill and other intangible assets acquired as part of the disbursement business acquisition of  million have been subsequently reclassified and are presented in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets at december   fhlb federal reserve bank and other restricted stock fhlb federal reserve bank and other restricted stock represents required investment in the capital stock of the federal home loan bank “fhlb” the federal reserve bank and atlantic central bankers bank and is carried at cost total restricted stock as of december   and  was  million and  million  respectively which included  million and  million  respectively of fhlb stock other real estate owned real estate properties acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis after foreclosure valuations are periodically performed by management and the real estate is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in earnings  fdic loss sharing receivable and clawback liability the fdic loss sharing receivable was measured separately from the related covered assets because it was not contractually embedded in the assets and was not transferable if the assets were sold the fdic loss sharing receivable was initially recorded at fair value based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows under the loss share agreements the difference between the present value and the undiscounted cash flows the bank expected to collect from the fdic was accreted into interest income over the life of the fdic loss sharing receivable  table of contents the fdic loss sharing receivable was reviewed quarterly and adjusted for changes in expected cash flows based on recent performance and expectations for future performance of the covered portfolio these adjustments were measured on the same basis as the related covered assets increases in estimated cash flows on the covered assets reduced the fdic loss sharing receivable and decreases in estimated cash flows on the covered assets increased the fdic loss sharing receivable increases to the fdic loss sharing receivable resulting from reduced cash flow estimates on the covered loans were recorded as a reduction to the provision for loan losses and decreases to the fdic loss sharing receivable were recorded either as an increase to the provision for loan losses to the extent an increase in the fdic receivable balance was previously recorded as a reduction to the provision for loan losses or recognized over the life of the loss share agreements decreases in the valuations of covered other real estate owned were recorded net of the fdic receivable balance as an increase to other real estate owned expense a component of noninterest expense the fdic loss sharing receivable balance was reduced through a charge to the provision for loan losses with no offsetting reduction to the allowance for loan losses as the period to submit losses under the fdic loss sharing agreements approached expiration and the estimated losses in the covered loans had not yet emerged or been realized in a final disposition event the period to submit losses under the fdic loss sharing agreements for nonsingle family loans expired in third quarter  the period to submit losses under the fdic loss sharing agreements for single family loans was set to expire in third quarter  the final maturity of the fdic loss sharing agreements was scheduled for third quarter  as part of the fdic loss sharing agreements the bank also assumed a potential liability to be paid within  days subsequent to the maturity or termination of the loss sharing agreements that was contingent upon actual losses incurred over the life of the agreements relative to expected losses and the consideration paid upon acquisition of the failed institutions due to cash received on the covered assets in excess of the original expectations of the fdic the bank anticipated that it would be required to pay the fdic at the end of its loss sharing agreements on july   customers entered into an agreement to terminate all existing rights and obligations pursuant to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic in connection with the termination agreement customers paid the fdic  million as final payment under these agreements the negotiated settlement amount was based on net losses incurred on the covered assets through september   adjusted for cash payments to and cash receipts from the fdic as part of the december   and march   certifications consequently loans and other real estate owned previously reported as covered assets pursuant to the loss sharing agreements were no longer reported as covered assets as of june     bankowned life insurance bankowned life insurance

tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur  table of contents a tax position is recognized if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than  percent  the term upon examination includes resolution of the related appeals or litigation process a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than  percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information the determination of whether or not a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold considers the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment in assessing the realizability of federal or state deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and prudent feasible and permissible as well as available tax planning strategies in making this assessment based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible as well as available tax planning strategies management believes it is more likely than not that customers will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets sharebased compensation customers has four active sharebased compensation plans sharebased compensation accounting guidance requires that the compensation cost relating to sharebasedpayment transactions be recognized in earnings the cost is measured based on the grantdate fair value of the equity instruments issued the blackscholes model is used to estimate the fair value of stock options while the closing market price of customers’ common stock at the date of grant is generally used for restricted stock awards compensation cost for all sharebased awards is calculated and recognized over the employees’ service period generally defined as the vesting period for performance based awards compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period as long as it remains probable that the performance conditions will be met if the service or performance conditions are not met customers reverses previously recorded compensation expense upon forfeiture customers accounting policy election is to recognize forfeitures as they occur   in  the shareholders of customers bancorp approved an employee stock purchase plan because the purchase price under the plan is  of a  discount to the market price the fair market value of a share of common stock on the first day of each quarterly subscription period the plan is considered to be a compensatory plan under

derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative whether customers has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interest rate risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge customers may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks even though hedge accounting does not apply or customers elects not to apply hedge accounting prior to first quarter

common shares that may be issued related to outstanding stock options restricted stock units and warrants are determined using the treasury stock method recently issued accounting standards and updates in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill fasb eliminated step  from the goodwill impairment test namely an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination instead under the amendments in this asu an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit additionally an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable fasb also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and if it fails that qualitative test to perform step  of the goodwill impairment test therefore the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units an entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years customers does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a significant impact on its financial statements and results of operations in january  the fasb issued asu no  clarifying the definition of a business  under current guidance there are three elements of a business—inputs processes and outputs while an integrated set of assets and activities collectively referred to as a “set” that is a business usually has outputs outputs are not required to be present in addition all the inputs and processes that a seller uses in operating a set are not required if market participants can acquire the set and continue to produce outputs for example by integrating the acquired set with their own inputs and processes the amendments in this asu provide a criterion to determine when a set is not a business the criterion requires that a set not be deemed to be a business when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets this criterion reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated if the criterion is not met the amendments in this asu  require that to be considered a business a set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and  remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements the amendments provide a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present the amendments in this asu are effective for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those periods customers does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a significant impact on its financial statements and results of operations in november  the fasb issued asu no  statement of cash flows restricted cash  the amendments in this asu require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the

statements and results of operations  table of contents in october  the fasb issued asu no  interests held through related parties that are under common control  the amendments in this asu do not change the characteristics of a primary beneficiary under current guidance namely that a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie has  the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and  the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie if a reporting entity satisfies the first characteristic ie it is the single decision maker of a vie the amendments in this asu require that reporting entity in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary to include all of its direct variable interests in a vie and on a proportionate basis its indirect variable interests in a vie held through related parties including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity therefore under the amendments a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control with the single decision maker to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety instead a single decision maker is required to include those interests on a proportionate basis consistent with indirect interests held through other related parties if after performing that assessment a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a vie concludes that it does not have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary the amendments continue to require that reporting entity to evaluate whether it and one or more of its related parties under common control as a group have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary if the single decision maker and its related parties that are under common control as a group have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary then the party within the related party group that is most closely associated with the vie is the primary beneficiary the amendments in this asu are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years customers adoption of

retroactively applied the guidance effective as of january   as a result of the early adoption customers recognized excess tax benefits as a reduction of income tax expense of  million for the year

financial instrument to separate an embedded derivative feature from a host contract and account for the feature as a derivative in the case of derivatives embedded in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share that criterion requires evaluating whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or to equity and whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to the host contract if the host contract is akin to equity then equitylike features for example a conversion option are considered clearly and closely related to the host contract and thus would not be separated from the host contract if the host contract is akin to debt then equitylike features are not considered clearly and closely related to the host contract in the latter case an entity may be required to separate the equitylike embedded derivative feature from the debt host contract if certain other criteria in subtopic  are met similarly debtlike embedded derivative features may require separate accounting from an equitylike host contract the guidance in this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim

for which the requisite has already been rendered if the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite period the remaining unrecognized cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period the total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards

including those that previously followed industryspecific guidance such as the real estate and construction industries the revenue standard’s core principal is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services it attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which  table of contents the vendor is entitled to accomplish this the standard requires five basic steps i identify the contract with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii identify the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies the performance obligation three basic transition methods are available  full retrospective retrospective with certain practical expedients and a cumulative effect approach under the cumulative effect alternative an entity would apply the new revenue standard only to contracts that are incomplete under legacy us gaap at the date of initial application and recognize the cumulative effect of the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in august  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers deferral of the effective date  the guidance in this asu is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period in march  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net  while the asu does not change the core provisions of topic  it clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations namely the asu clarifies and offers guidance to help determine when the reporting entity is providing goods or services to a customer itself ie the entity is a principal or merely arranging for that good or service to be provided by the other party ie the reporting entity is an agent if the entity is a principal it recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer when the reporting entity is an agent it recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the other party an entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer the guidance includes indicators to assist in determining whether the control criteria are met if a contract with a customer includes more than one specified good or service an entity could be a principal for some specified goods or services and an agent for others in april  the fasb issued asu no   revenue from contracts with customers identifying performance obligations and licensing this asu clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard the asu includes targeted improvements based on input the fasb received from the transition resource group for revenue recognition and other stakeholders the asu seeks to proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis the amendments in this asu affect the guidance in asu  revenue from contracts with customers which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   for public entities in may  the fasb issued asu no   revenue from contracts with customers narrowscope improvements and practical expedients this asu clarifies certain aspects of topic  guidance as follows • the objective of the collectibility assessment is to determine whether the contract is valid and represents a substantive transaction on the basis of whether a customer has the ability and intention to pay the promised consideration in exchange for the goods or services transferred • an entity can recognize revenue in the amount of consideration received when it has transferred control of the goods or services has no additional obligation to transfer goods or services and the consideration received is nonrefundable • a reporting entity is permitted to make the accounting policy election to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales taxes from the transaction price • the measurement date is specified as being the contract inception and variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration • as a practical expedient a reporting entity is permitted to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented in accordance with topic  when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations  table of contents • the asu clarifies that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all or substantially all of the revenue was recognized under legacy gaap before the date of initial application accounting for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy gaap are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract is complete in addition the amendments in this asu permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts or only to contracts that are not completed contracts the amendments in this asu clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in topic  to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption however an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted the guidance in the revenue recognition asus listed above is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period customers is

standard regulatory rating definitions are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter passsatisfactory ratings which are assigned to those borrowers who do not have identified potential or welldefined weaknesses and for whom there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment are updated periodically based on the size of the exposure and credit characteristics of the borrower all other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter certain consumer loans are not assigned a risk rating while assigning risk ratings involves judgment the riskrating process allows management to identify riskier credits in a timely manner and allocate the appropriate resources to managing the loans the risk rating grades are defined as follows “” – pass  excellent loans rated  represent a credit extension of the highest quality the borrower’s historic at least five years cash flows manifest extremely large and stable margins of coverage balance sheets are conservative well capitalized and liquid after considering debt service for proposed and existing debt projected cash flows continue to be strong and provide ample coverage the borrower typically reflects broad geographic and product diversification and has access to alternative financial markets “” – pass  superior loans rated  are those for which the borrower has a strong financial condition balance sheet operations cash flow debt capacity and coverage with ratios better than industry norms the borrowers of these loans exhibit a limited leverage position are virtually immune to local economies and are in stable growing industries the management team is well respected and the company has ready access to public markets “” – pass  strong loans rated  are those loans for which the borrowers have above average financial condition and flexibility more than satisfactory debt service coverage balance sheet and operating ratios are consistent with or better than industry peers operate in industries with little industry risk move in diversified markets and are experienced and competent in their industry these borrowers access to capital markets is limited mostly to private sources often secured but the borrower typically has access to a wide range of refinancing alternatives “” – pass  good loans rated  have a sound primary and secondary source of repayment the borrower may have access to alternative sources of financing but sources are not as widely available as they are to a higher grade borrower these loans carry a normal level of risk with very low loss exposure the borrower has the ability to perform according to the terms of the credit facility the margins of cash flow coverage are satisfactory but vulnerable to more rapid deterioration than the higher quality loans “” – satisfactory loans rated  are extended to borrowers who are determined to be a reasonable credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the debt from normal business operations risk factors may include reliability of margins and cash flows liquidity dependence on a single product or industry cyclical trends depth of management or limited access to alternative financing sources the borrower’s historical financial information may indicate erratic performance but current trends are positive and the quality of financial information is adequate but is not as detailed and sophisticated as information found on higher grade loans if adverse circumstances arise the impact on the borrower may be significant  table of contents “” – satisfactory  bankable with care loans rated  are those for which the borrower has higher than normal credit risk however cash flow and asset values are generally intact these borrowers may exhibit declining financial characteristics with increasing leverage and decreasing liquidity and may have limited resources and access to financial alternatives signs of weakness in these borrowers may include delinquent taxes trade slowness and eroding profit margins “” – special mention loans rated special mention are credit facilities that may have potential developing weaknesses and deserve extra attention from the account manager and other management personnel in the event potential weaknesses are not corrected or mitigated deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the debt in the future may occur this grade is not assigned to loans that bear certain peculiar risks normally associated with the type of financing involved unless circumstances have caused the risk to increase to a level higher than would have been acceptable when the credit was originally approved loans where significant actual not potential weaknesses or problems are clearly evident are graded in the category below “” – substandard loans are classified substandard when the loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any loans so classified must have a welldefined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected “” – doubtful doubtful ratings are assigned to loans that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts conditions and values highly questionable and improbable the possibility of loss is extremely high but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition liquidation proceeding capital injection perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans “” – loss the bank assigns a loss rating to loans considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as an active asset is not warranted amounts classified as loss are immediately charged off risk ratings are not established for certain consumer loans including home equity loans manufactured housing and installment loans mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of homogeneous loans with smaller balances instead these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based upon aggregate payment history through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends and are classified as performing and nonperforming the following table presents the credit ratings as of december   and  for the

income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense current and deferred current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues customers determines deferred income taxes using the liability or balance sheet method under this method the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur a tax position is recognized if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than  percent  the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation process if any a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than  percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information the determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment at december   and   customers had no asc  unrecognized tax benefits customers does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase within the next twelve months customers recognizes interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in other expense realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback period a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we have not recorded a deferred tax asset on our unrecorded basis difference in our foreign subsidiary because we currently do not expect it to reverse in the foreseeable future in assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities the level of historical taxable income and the projected future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible based on its assessment management determined that no valuation allowance is necessary at december   and   deferred income taxes reflect temporary differences in the

course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit those instruments involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets customers exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments customers uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for onbalancesheet instruments the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk   december        amounts in thousands   commitments to fund loans       unfunded commitments to fund mortgage warehouse loans     unfunded commitments under lines of credit     letters of credit     other unused commitments     commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements mortgage warehouse loan commitments are agreements to purchase mortgage loans from mortgage bankers that agree to purchase the loans back in a short period of time these commitments generally fluctuate monthly as existing loans are repurchased by the mortgage bankers and new loans are purchased by customers commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee customers evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a casebycase basis the amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by customers upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate accounts receivable inventory and equipment outstanding letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by customers to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party the majority of these standby letters of credit expire within the next year the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending other loan commitments customers requires collateral supporting these letters of credit as deemed necessary management believes that the proceeds obtained through a liquidation of such collateral would be sufficient to cover the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the corresponding guarantees the current amount of the liabilities as of december   and  for guarantees under standby letters of credit issued was not material  table of contents note  – regulatory matters the bank and the bancorp are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on customers financial statements under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action the bank and bancorp must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the bank and bancorp to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of common equity tier  tier  total capital to riskweighted assets and tier  capital to average assets as defined in the regulations at december   and   the bank and the bancorp met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject the

instruments customers uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments fasb accounting standards codification asc topic   financial instruments  requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of an entity’s assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments for customers as for most financial institutions the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered to be financial instruments however many of these instruments lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction for fair value disclosure purposes customers utilized certain fair value measurement criteria under the fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  as explained below in accordance with asc  the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices however in many instances there are no quoted market prices for customers’ various financial instruments in cases where quoted market prices are not available fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows accordingly the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument the fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value focusing on an exit price in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate in such instances determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment the fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions the fair value guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy and describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements   level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities     level  quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability     level  prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable ie supported with little or no market activity a financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of customers’ financial instruments as of december   and   cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets’ fair values these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements  table of contents investment securities the fair values of investment securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized and foreign securities exchanges level  matrix pricing level  which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices or externally developed models that use unobservable inputs due to limited or no market activity of the instrument level  these assets are included as level   or  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements the carrying amount of fhlb federal reserve bank and other restricted stock approximates fair value and considers the limited marketability of such securities these assets are classified as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements loans held for sale  residential mortgage loans the bank generally estimates the fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements loans held for sale  mortgage warehouse loans the fair value of mortgage warehouse loans is the amount of cash initially advanced to fund the mortgage plus accrued interest and fees as specified in the respective agreements the loan is used by mortgage companies as shortterm bridge financing between the funding of mortgage loans and the finalization of the sale of the loans to an investor changes in fair value are not expected to be recognized since at inception of the transaction the underlying loans have already been sold to an approved investor additionally the interest rate is variable and the transaction is shortterm with an average life of  days from purchase to sale these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements loans held for sale  multifamily loans the fair values of multifamily loans held for sale are estimated using pricing indications from letters of intent with third party investors recent sale transactions within the secondary markets for loans with similar characteristics nonbinding indicative bids from brokers or estimates made by management considering current market rates and terms these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements loans receivable net of allowance for loan losses the fair values of loans held for investment are estimated using discounted cash flows using market rates at the balance sheet date that reflect the credit and interest raterisk inherent in the loans projected future cash flows are calculated based upon contractual maturity or call dates projected repayments and prepayments of principal generally for variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk fair values are based on carrying values these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements impaired loans impaired loans are those that are accounted for under asc  receivables  in which the bank has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral or discounted cash flow analysis fair value is generally determined based upon independent thirdparty appraisals of the properties that collateralize the loans or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements other real estate owned the fair value of other real estate owned oreo is determined using appraisals which may be discounted based on management’s review and changes in market conditions or sales agreements with third parties all appraisals must be performed in accordance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice appraisals are certified to the bank and performed by appraisers on the bank’s approved list of appraisers evaluations are completed by a person independent of management the content of the appraisal depends on the complexity of the property appraisals are completed on a “retail value” and an “as is value” these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements  table of contents deposit liabilities the fair values disclosed for interest and noninterest checking passbook savings and money market deposit accounts are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date ie their carrying amounts these liabilities are classified as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements fair values for fixedrate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits these liabilities are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements federal funds purchased for these shortterm instruments the carrying amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value these liabilities are classified as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements borrowings borrowings consist of longterm and shortterm fhlb advances  year senior unsecured notes and subordinated debt for the shortterm borrowings the carrying amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value and is classified as a level  fair values measurement fair values of longterm fhlb advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on quoted prices for new fhlb advances with similar credit risk characteristics terms and remaining maturity the prices obtained from this active market represent a market value that is deemed to represent the transfer price if the liability were assumed by a third party fair values of privately placed subordinated and senior unsecured debt are estimated by a thirdparty financial adviser using discounted cash flow analysis based on market rates currently offered on such debt with similar creditrisk characteristics terms and remaining maturity these liabilities are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements the  million senior unsecured notes issued during third quarter  are traded on the new york stock exchange and their price can be obtained daily this fair value measurement is classified as level  derivatives assets and liabilities the fair values of interest rate swaps and credit derivatives are determined using models that incorporate readily observable market data into a market standard methodology this methodology nets the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments the discounted variable cash payments are based on expectations of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves in addition fair value is adjusted for the effect of nonperformance risk by incorporating credit valuation adjustments for the bank and its counterparties these assets and liabilities are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements the fair values of the residential mortgage loan commitments are derived from the estimated fair values that can be generated when the underlying mortgage loan is sold in the secondary market the bank generally uses commitments on hand from third party investors to estimate an exit price and adjusts for the probability of the commitment being exercised based on the bank’s internal experience ie pullthrough rate these assets and liabilities are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements derivative assets and liabilities are presented in other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet assets

remaining liabilities classified as held for sale consist of accrued liabilities not considered financial instruments under asc   financial instruments  table of contents offbalancesheet financial instruments the fair values of unused commitments to lend and standby letters of credit are considered to be the same as their contractual amounts the following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of customers fair value in its entirety because fair value calculations are only provided for a limited portion of customers’ assets and liabilities  due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making these estimates comparisons between customers’ disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful the estimated fair values of

derivative instruments and hedging activities risk management objectives of using derivatives customers is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions customers manages economic risks including interest rate liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount sources and durations of its assets and liabilities specifically customers enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts the values of which are determined by interest rates customers’ derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount timing and duration of customers’ known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain borrowings customers also has interestrate derivatives resulting from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and therefore they are not used to manage customers’ interestrate risk in assets or liabilities customers manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments used in this customer service in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions cash flow hedges of interest rate risk customers’ objectives in using interestrate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage exposure to interest rate movements to accomplish this objective customers sometimes uses interest rate swaps as part of its interestraterisk management strategy interestrate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for customers making fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings during  and   such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the forecasted issuances of debt the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is to be recognized directly in earnings during  and  customers did not record any hedge ineffectiveness   amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on customers’ variablerate debt customers expects to reclassify  million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense during the next  months customers is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of  months excluding forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments at december    customers had four outstanding interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling   million that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk at december   customers had one outstanding interest rate derivative with a notional amount of  million that was designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk the hedges expire between october  and april  derivatives not designated as hedging instruments customers executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate the customers respective risk management strategies typically the loan customers will swap a floating rate loan to a fixed rate loan the customer interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that customers executes with a third party in order to minimize interest rate risk exposure resulting from such transactions because the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the hedge accounting requirements changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting thirdparty market swaps are recognized directly in earnings at december    customers had  interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of   million related to this program at december    customers had  interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of   million related to this program customers enters into residential mortgage loan commitments in connection with its consumer mortgage banking activities to fund mortgage loans at specified rates and times in the future these commitments are shortterm in nature and generally expire in  to  days  the residential mortgage loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are considered derivative instruments under applicable accounting
