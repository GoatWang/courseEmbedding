has been president of nasdaq omx copenhagen since april of  he was the chief executive of etrade bank in denmark from  and before that he was vice president of customers and company service at omx he spoke with sarah rudolph about the nordic markets and about the new genium inet platform the exchange launched monday which one news story called “the world’s fastest trading system” q could you tell us a bit about nasdaq omx copenhagen what options products do you offer and what kind of traders trade there a in the danish derivatives market the most interesting options product is options in large cap names that is probably typical for most exchanges the most heavily traded name is vestas wind systems the largest windmill company in the world another is novo nordisk a pharmaceutical company that specializes in insulin products that is the highest cap company on which options are traded q is there a lot of interest in options in denmark a i think there is great potential but traditionally the interest has been in the cash products the tax for derivatives has been pretty high both from a retail and an institutional perspective so there has not been a big tradition of trading options compared to our neighbor sweden for example which has a much bigger market because of lower taxation and tradition but we have seen recent changes in the tax scheme in copenhagen so we have high expectation for growth in the derivatives market and investors are becoming better at understanding how you can use options in particular for hedging that is becoming more and more relevant for investors the danish derivatives market is traded together with the swedish and finnish products on the same platform with the same clearing we have combined the three markets we currently have  members connected to the nordic platform q what is your most popular product in general at the exchange the c index is our popular index similar to the sp  in the us it is the most traded in copenhagen in sweden it is the s index q can you trade options on those indexes a you can but i think on the index side there is more trading in futures in the equity products there is more trading in single name options than futures q what technology is nasdaq omx copenhagen currently using and what are your technology plans for the future a we just launched a new platform on october  called genium inet the reason for the launch is of course that it is much faster –  times faster than the existing system speed is one of the main drivers but we also believe the new platform is more reliable and more flexible in functionalities there is also an enormous increase in capacity the system can handle much bigger volume all that is very important for our high frequency traders so now we can move our fixed income and derivatives onto the same platform i should also mention that genium inet is a system we have sold to other exchanges nasdaq omx has sold trading systems to more than  exchanges around the world – either trading systems or clearing systems we are a big system provider around the world we have sold genium inet to the australian stock exchange and the singapore exchange q marketswiki is holding an event on october  called “a world of opportunity” about accessing international markets how do you see foreign markets reaching out internationally a we have doubled the number of our derivative members in the past year and i think the reason behind this development is that the world is becoming more international it is extremely important for nasdaq omx in the nordic market to make sure businesses around the world have easy and cheap access to trade our markets we spend a lot of time on infrastructure to make sure it’s reliable and fast and make sure we reach a global investor base q what specific efforts do you make to reach a global investor base a we spend lot of time trying to add new members to our platforms the key is to have interesting products our biggest product is the swedish index product we try to make sure banks and brokers connect to our markets by securing ecns and having strong products on the platform also the fact we are a part of nasdaq and have access to the us market gives us a great upside q what are the regulatory or other obstacles facing us and european citizens who are interested in accessing your exchange a it’s not easy for us citizens to access the exchange currently financial institutions in the us cannot have direct electronic access to trade options investors around the world go through nordic banks or through banks and brokers in the uk — which are often subsidiaries of us banks half of our member base comes from outside the nordic countries when we look at options and derivatives if and when the sec issues a noaction relief our options can be traded by qualified us customers  avg rating  score   votes about author sarah rudolph rudolph is managing editor of john lothian news jln bjørn

wholesome than ever before february was nothing short of remarkable in terms of the number of trades completed it goes down as the most active month ever on the stock market never before have so many share trades been completed in one month this equates to a daily trade figure of over dkk  billion deriving from over  trades a day why is this remarkable because the stock market acts as a daily opinion poll the key to the reliability of this poll is the steadily increasing level of activity which is a good indicator of the trust in the market in danish companies and in the economy as a whole we are all shareholders in one way or another and we all have a stake in an active and effective stock market as it represents a unique cog in the socioeconomic ‘wheel’ on the one hand it ensures that danes are able to share in the success of danish companies and on the other it makes it possible for danish companies to make longterm investments no other model apart from this hundredyearold tried and tested stock exchange model allows the danish people to become stakeholders in denmark’s future and no other model gives companies such good conditions for sourcing capital warming up for listings what we have witnessed in the last few months has been the warmup ahead of the coming months’ listings where a longer period of higher pricing levels and less uncertainty with regard to direction has made the market particularly attractive to new companies from an investor’s point of view it may be worth considering whether or not to participate in new share issues according to an experiment conducted by our analysts investors would have achieved far higher returns on their investments by participating in the last five listings on the stock exchange     we call this experiment the twin test and we have conducted it in two stages  covering the period from the company’s initial stock market introduction to the end of   covering the period from the company’s initial stock market introduction and one month onwards starting with the latter the comparison shows that if an investor invests a sum eg  per cent of the total share capital issued and sold it a month after listing they would after having participated in the last five listings achieve a return of  per cent if we imagine that this investor had a twin who in the same period at each ipo invested exactly the same amount in the copenhagen benchmark index instead of in the newly listed company the total return would have been  per cent the tables below show how great a return an investor saw by investing in a listing compared with what the same investment would have yielded in the copenhagen benchmark index     as we can see not all new listings have been equally successful but the experiment shows that overall it has paid to participate in the last five listings on nasdaq omx copenhagen now that several large organisations have set their sights on the danish stock market investors will have ample opportunity to participate in new listings welcome to nasdaq omx interview with bjorn sibbern december  what have you been doing this week i spoke to børsen about our new intraday auction for mid small cap segments and first north to improve liquidity for investors and companies alike and wednesday we hosted margrethe vestager at børsforum where we asked her and a prominent allstar panel of speakers the question why do we need a strong danish marketplace the answer created a great debate in the audience and kicked off the public leg of the danish ipo task force to improve listing climate for smes we have one of the strongest marketplaces and it seems obvious that we use it to create more growth for smes   did you have a nice summer what have you done i spent two weeks on playitas sports and free time with family besides vacation this summer was a bit busier than usual we saw higher trading activity not least thanks to june’s listing of matas which became the sixth largest ipo of the quarter in europe and received  new shareholders where do you prefer to travel on your free time with over  travel days a year i have no preferences – besides spending time with family and doing sports how do you like to  revitalize i would say running and playing golf which qualifications do you see as the most important among your colleague the two most important are commitment and ability to execute the ability to move a project from a to b your favourite dish risotto your favourite  interests sports which are the hardest challenges for your economy today the challenges for the danish economy is the slow growth in bnp if we as an economy were better at using the dynamics of the danish equity market more companies would be able to raise capital for growth and jobs what’s your opinion about the  local exchange rolemission in your economy the role of the exchange is to provide a marketplace where investors – ordinary citizens like you and me – can invest our savings in listed companies it is this ability that has made it possible for listed company to raise capital for growth and jobs since  where we were given status as regulated market place for trading equity which challenges do you think will be the hardest for the local exchange on the danish exchange we have seen a remarkeable increase in turnover and we have had three ipos among the biggest introductions since  but it is still dificult for small companies to access funding together with market participants we need to have a look at how we improve this channel for smes and how we use the great potential and momentum we have on the copenhagen exchange to open the doors for small companies for more liquidity a case in point is our introduction of a midday auction at year end to improve liquidity in the smaller segments among other initiatives that we are working on with market participants what are you most proud of at work besides maximising the effeciency of the marketplace so that liquidity and shorter spreads have lowered the cost of trading and the fact that we have had three of the biggest ipos in the nordics i am very proud of the fact that we in december  launched first north bond market – an alternative marketplace for issuing corporate bonds for smaller and midsized unlisted companies that is an attempt at broadening the road to financing and funding for danish companies as well as contribute to make it easier to diversify investments i want to be the forthcoming ceo do you have any advice for me hard work beats talent what do you wish for christmas i look forward to spend time with my family what is your new year’s eve resolution my new year’s resolution is to work hard at taking the good momentum we have on the copenhagen exchange to build a broader equity culture in denmark in denmark there is a lot of passive capital in bank accounts at practically no interest rate this saved capital should be activated to provide greater yields and provide greater funding opportunities for danish companies and danish growth and then i aim at cutting my marathon time with  minutes to  hrs sibbern bjorn  nasdaq inc insider transactions  tipranks go prologin  sign up

has hit the ground running managing the company’s largest business unit by revenue he currently resides in his hometown of copenhagen but will be relocating to new york city later this month a nasdaq veteran we sat down with bjorn to learn more about his career and vision for information services this year and beyondq you’ve held a number of key roles in the past decade at nasdaq can you share with us more about your storied career trajectorya i’ve had the pleasure and opportunity to work at nasdaq for nine years and most recently led and grew our global commodities business from denmark while also serving as president of the copenhagen exchange prior i headed our nordic cash equities and derivatives markets one of my proudest accomplishments was championing the launch and operations of our futures exchange nfx two years ago a fun fact that you may not know about me is that i was once a nasdaq market data customer while serving as the ceo of etrade bank denmark it was a positive experience and today i am excited to make the data journey full circle and to now lead our information services business that focuses on market data and index products and servicesq can you tell us more about the information services group where do you see opportunities to grow the business in a nasdaq information services is composed of our market data and index business that provides market

approximately  employees we offer market data for  solutions and  indexes that reach thousands of investment professionals having just wrapped up my third month on the job i see three ways to grow our data and index business this year and beyond first by upgrading existing products to provide more value for customers second by building new data  index products and secure further global expansion and third by experimenting with machine learning in our innovation lab to build analytic products of the future that we can share with customers todayq technology continues to disrupt the financial services industry how and what sorts of technologies are disrupting your businessa our business is approaching an inflection point where technology is changing the way we think about data and interact

understand how they perform in the market how the market behaves and how they can adjust their strategies to be more successful we have plans to expand the suite with additional components including separate products focused on thirdparty and options data later this yearq what index and etf trends do you see emerging in  what are some index and etf growth opportunities for nasdaqa the overall trend from active to passive index investing will continue last year approximately  percent of active managers failed to meet their benchmark compared to  percent the year prior smart beta assets under management aum will continue to grow and chip away from mutual fund aum this trend has been strong in the us for years and we are starting to see these patterns pick up momentum in europe and in asia our index business is well positioned to continue to take advantage of this trend we see tremendous opportunity to help asset managers launch etfs based off our indexes around the world in three
