for letters of credit by harton h lynn read preview magazine article journal of commercial lending developing rational policies for letters of credit by harton h lynn read preview article excerpt letters of credit lcs have been an integral part of commercial business transactions for hundreds of years yet owing to their detailed documentation requirements lcs have typically been handled by specialists in the banking industry leaving account officers somewhat in the dark regarding the mystery of lcs in reality account officers are the best people to prospect for lc opportunities and to manage the risk in existing and prospective lc transactions by developing and communicating rational policies concerning the use of lcs banks can help account officers be more effective with this important bank product line a letter of credit lc involves at least three parties a bank the issuing bank a customer on whose behalf the lc is issued the applicant and a person to whom payment from the lc will flow the beneficiary lcs are written instruments issued by banks stating that payments will be made on behalf of applicants to beneficiaries provided that the beneficiary fulfills all the conditions described in the instrument in essence the effect of an lc is to substitute the credit of a bank which is generally well known for the credit of an applicant which is either not as well known or not considered to be adequate by the beneficiary in issuing the lc the bank becomes entitled to reimbursement from the applicant for any payments that the bank properly makes the applicant may provide collateral to the bank to secure the repayment of the reimbursement obligation or the bank may simply rely on the applicants promise to pay the bank receives fees for issuing and handling lcs principle of independence as professionals bankers have a duty to protect not only the interest of their banks but also their customers interests applicants are often unaware of the risk undertaken when they apply for an lc applicants must be made aware that the relationship between an issuing bank and the beneficiary is an entirely separate contractual relationship unlike that between the applicant and the beneficiary the bank deals in documents only not merchandise or performance and it therefore cannot ensure that the underlying transaction has been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the applicant when all stipulated documents are presented the issuing bank must pay the beneficiary the applicant must not rely on the lc for protection from the beneficiarys performance problems the banks responsibility is only to examine documents with reasonable care and to ascertain that they appear to comply with the requirements of the lc once the lc is issued the applicant faces the risk that the lc may be paid through fraudulent actions of the beneficiary another aspect of the independence of the relationships of the three parties involved relates to amendments of the lc proposed amendments must be acceptable to all parties issuer applicant and beneficiary to be considered in effect no party has the power to make unilateral changes in the terms of an irrevocable lc two categories lcs issued by my bank fall into two broad categories  commercial traderelated and standby commercial lcs commercial or traderelated lcs are used to carry out specific trade transactions involving the sale or purchase of goods sellers of goods desire to know that if they perform according to the terms of their agreement with the purchaser that is deliver the product they will be paid the presence of the lc from a financially strong third party gives the seller beneficiary that assurance by providing this assurance to the beneficiary the bank obviously assumes credit risk as previously mentioned lcs rely on documents not verified performance for a beneficiary to claim payment under an lc the beneficiarys documents must conform exactly to those required by the lc … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over  million more from academic journals magazines and newspapers over  books access to powerful writing and
