newsletters venture capital funds share what are venture capital funds venture capital funds are investment funds that manage the money of investors who seek private equity stakes in startup and small to mediumsized enterprises with strong growth potential these investments are generally characterized as highriskhighreturn opportunities in the past venture capital investments were only accessible to professional venture capitalists although now accredited investors have a greater ability to take part in venture capital investments breaking down venture capital funds venture capital is a type of equity financing that gives entrepreneurial or other small companies the ability to raise funding venture capital funds are private equity investment vehicles that seek to invest in firms that have highriskhighreturn profiles based on a companys size assets and stage of product developmentventure capital funds differ from mutual funds and hedge funds in that they focus on a very specific type of earlystage investment all firms that receive venture capital investments have highgrowth potential are risky and have a long investment horizon further venture capital funds take a more active role in their investments by providing guidance and often holding a board seatventure capital funds have portfolio returns that resemble a barbell approach to investing many of these funds make small bets on a wide variety of young startups believing that at least one will achieve high growth and reward the fund with a comparatively large payout at the end this allows the fund to mitigate the risk that some investments will foldthe operation of a venture capital fundventure capital investments are considered either seed capital earlystage capital or expansionstage financing depending on the maturity of the business at the time of the investment however regardless of the investment stage all venture capital funds operate in much the same wayfirst like all funds venture capital funds must raise money prior to making any investments a prospectus is given to potential investors of the fund who then commit money to that fund all potential investors who make a commitment are called by the funds operators and individual investment amounts are finalizedfrom there the venture capital fund seeks private equity investments that have the potential of generating positive returns for its investors this normally means the funds manager or managers review hundreds of business plans in search of potentially highgrowth companies the fund managers make investment decisions based on the prospectus and the expectations of the funds investors after an investment is made the fund charges an annual management fee of around investors of a venture capital fund make returns when a portfolio company exits either in an ipo or a merger and acquisition if a profit is made off the exit the fund also keeps a percentage of the profits in addition to the annual management fee trading center venture

for finance coming soon fundamental investing coming soon financial modeling all courses site log in advisor insights log in newsletters series a b c funding what it all means and how it works by shoshanna delventhal  updated may   —  am edt share to those who aren’t well versed in the field of entrepreneurship and early stage investing series a series b and series c might seem like confusing terms fortunately the terms are easy to understand series a b and c have nothing to do with the alphabet rather the letters correspond with the development stage of the companies that are raising capital series a b and c are necessary ingredients for a business that decides “bootstrapping” or merely surviving off of the generosity of friends family and the depth of their own pockets will not suffice the main differences between rounds are the maturity levels of the businesses the type of investors involved the purpose of raising capital and how it is ultimately allocated the funding rounds begin with a “seed capital” phase and follow with a b and then c funding once you understand the distinction between these rounds it will be easier to analyze headlines regarding the startup and investing world by grasping the context of what exactly a round means for the prospects and direction of a company series a b and c funding rounds are merely stepping stones in the process of turning an ingenious idea into a revolutionary global company ripe for an ipo how funding works investors aren’t just altruistic entrepreneurialloving businesspeople although they may be genuinely interested in the business as many angel investors are they ask for a portion of the business in turn for giving money before each round a valuation of the company pie is typically released valuations derive from considerations such as management proven track record market size and risk to grow the pie’s circumference more than a few slices need to be given away in fact most of the slices will be auctioned off for funding many small business owners with a big idea would rather have a sliver of a massive pie than the entirety of a bitesized treat planting the seed you can think of seed capital like an analogy for planting a seed for a tree this round nurtures the seed or the idea for the startup the seed hopefully grows into a mature operating business or “tree” when enough revenue is generated with the help of perseverance and investor’s wallets the capital raised during the seed phase is roughly around  to  million but differs widely on a case by case basis seed funding raises substantial funds to support the initial market research and development work for the company this includes figuring out what the product will be and who they users or consumers will be additionally the money will help employ a team to do this work before this stage many entrepreneurs are working alone or with just a few business partners with seed capital the team will build and launch their product at their target audience the key players in this round are more of the riskloving type usually angel investors and early stage venture capital firms dabble in this less formal round of funding optimize series a after the business has shown some of a track record series a funding is useful in optimizing product and user base opportunities may be taken to scale the product across different markets in this round it’s important to have a plan for developing a business model that will generate longterm profit often times seed startups have great ideas that generate a substantial amount of enthusiastic users but the company doesn’t know how it will monetize on them typically series a rounds raise approximately  million to  million but this number has increased on average due to high recent tech industry valuations or unicorns the investors involved in the series a round come from more traditional venture capital firms wellknown venture capital firms that participate in series a funding include sequoia benchmark greylock accel and so on how exactly the process works differs slightly from seed capital rounds since in series a rounds there can be more politics at play a few firms lead the pack and may strategically do so angel investors also invest but tend to have much less influence in this funding round b is for build series b rounds are all about taking businesses to the next level past the development stage investors help startups get there by expanding market reach there’s already a big pie that’s been cooking up in seed and series a rounds in series b venture capitalists have more of vision around what the pie will look like and how big of a slice they hope to obtain building a winning product and growing a team requires quality talent acquisition bulking up on business development sales advertising tech support and other people costs a firm a few pennies estimated capital raised hovers around  to  million series b appears similar to series a in terms of processes and key players series b is often led by many of the same characters as the earlier round such as sequoia capital the difference with series b is the addition of a new wave of other vc firms that specialize in later stage investing let’s scale series c in series c rounds investors inject capital into the meat of successful businesses in efforts to receive more than double that amount back for example let’s say that our meatless meatball shop from series b now has the potential to put all burger kings out of business series c is about perfecting and of course continuing to scale fast and wide companies raise single digit to hundreds of millions in this final round one possible way to scale a company could be to acquire another say our vegetarian startup has shown unprecedented success selling their specific type of meatless meatball in the united states the business has reached targets coast to coast through confidence in market research and business planning investors reasonably believe that the business would do well in europe perhaps our meatless meatball startup has a competitor who currently possesses a large share of the market the competitor also has the competitive advantage that we could benefit from the culture fits and investors and founders alike believe the merger would be a synergistic partnership in this case series c funding could be used to buy another company as the operation gets less risky more investors come to play in series c groups such as hedge funds investment banks private equity firms and big secondary market groups accompany the beforementioned investors the bottom line understanding the distinction between these rounds of raising capital will help you decipher startup news and evaluate entrepreneurial prospects the rounds of funding work in essentially the same basic manner investors offer cash in return for an equity stake in the business between the rounds investors make slightly different demands on the startup company profiles differ with each case study but generally possess different risk profiles and maturity levels at each funding stage nevertheless seed series a b and c investors all nurture ideas to come to fruition series funding enables investors to support entrepreneurs with the proper funds to carry out their dreams perhaps cashing out together down the line in an ipo trending the

so youve finally finished developing your product or service flushed out your business model and youre ready to dive head first into your new business venture — but how the heck do you raise enough capital to get started taking venture capital is one way to secure the funds necessary for starting your business according to recent statistics from reuters venture capital firms invested over  billion dollars in startups in  and more than  million was invested in the first quarter of  although there is a lot of potential with venture capital firms it is important to make sure this is the right path for your startup in exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in your company they generally receive significant control over company decisions — in addition to a portion of the companys ownership but vcs can definitely be an attractive option for startups unable or unwilling to secure bank loans or complete debt offerings so if youve decided that applying for venture capital is the right move for your startup read on to learn about the musthave traits your business needs to attract funding  have a unique idea with high barriers to entry in order for venture capitalists to justify the large risk they are taking with your company you must offer them a fresh business venture that promises to fill a void in the marketplace in an interview with mashable charley polachi partner at polachi access executive search elaborated on the importance of having a truly unique idea with high barriers to entry venture capitalists are looking to fund projects that are unique and cant be easily replicated ideally the technology or service can be patented or trademarked to give the startup some breathing room and really allow the business some time to gain traction and marketshare anyone can sell something online but there are certain products that have yet to be developed — like the car battery that goes forever or innovative accessible and low cost energy sources these are the ideas that venture capitalists would drool over — they are motivated by the next big thing like anyone else  develop a compelling value proposition venture capitalists are really knowledgable in the startup space so you must be able to show them why your business is different and better than each of your competitors showing vcs that you have a compelling value proposition is hugely important and is often overlooked by firsttime entrepreneurs michael goldstein founder of dcbased startup accelerator exhilarator stressed the importance of determining customer interest my personal gauge when evaluating a startup is would the target customer wait in line for five minutes to get access to the productservice or would they abandon if it took five minutes to download an app or to access a site would the customer persist another important factor of creating a value proposition is scalability are there enough people interested to scale the business even if you have a really cool unique idea its not fundable if its not scalable what market are you going after and how large is it investors need to believe that the market opportunity is sizeable and that your company can generate substantial revenue at scale prahar shah ceo and cofounder of mobee elaborated on the importance of recognizing the opportunities in your market of interest be sure to size the market correctly and educate the investor not only on how large your market opportunity is but also why its ripe for disruption when i asked one of mobees investors why he decided to back us he quickly responded youre going after one of the only billiondollar industries — mystery shopping — thats still run on pen and paper  so the takeaway is this if your business is a product demonstrate that people are willing to pay for it and have an unmet need that your product fills if your business is a marketplace be ready to show traction on both supply and demand sides  demonstrate market traction in a competitive economy where only  of angelfunded companies go on to raise venture capital its important for a startup to show cognizance and relevance in their market earlystage vcs want to see a sizable market opportunity before writing a check and startups can demonstrate this through a pilot or beta customers more importantly startups should demonstrate the ability to convert that pilot into a paying customer nina nashif founder and ceo of healthbox believes that showing market traction is critical and startups should be able to replicate the process of turning a pilot into a paying customer over and over again the greater the number and the quality of early customers displays the startup has the ability to grow past the initial interest from early adopters  assemble the perfect team some think that having the right team is the most important factor in attracting venture capital funding startups rarely have the perfect product and market fit right away and they will probably need to pivot based on customer needs competitive factors and industry transformation ryan feit ceo and cofounder of seedinvest an equitybased crowdfunding platform that connects investors to highquality startups told mashable about the importance of finding the right team given the high degree of uncertainty associated with earlystage investing vcs bet on the jockey over the horse because they need to have a high level of conviction that the team has the necessary skills domain expertise and diversity to evolve just as quickly as the industry does so whether your team is made up of experienced entrepreneurs or recent college graduates — as long as your team members have complementary skills with a track record of collaborating well you should have a solid shot at attracting some venture capital funding how did your startup attract vc funding let us know in the comments image via istockphoto kativ the due diligence process in venture capital skip to content mars home mars library the due diligence process in venture capital vc  dec  the due diligence process in venture capital vc  dec  facebookgoogletwitterlinkedin the venture capital vc industry uses due diligence to describe what the investor does to evaluate a potential investment opportunity by definition investing in earlystage companies is risky the due diligence process should select the potential winners identify the key risks associated with the investment and develop a risk mitigation plan with company management as part of a potential investment due diligence is a rigorous process that determines whether or not the venture capital fund or other investor will invest in your company the process involves asking and answering a series of questions to evaluate the business and legal aspects of the opportunity once the process is complete the investor will use the outcomes of the process to finalize the internal approval process and complete the investment if the vc acts as a lead investor in a syndicate then they may also share the outcome of their due diligence with other investors there are three states of due diligence screening due diligence business due diligence legal due diligence stage  screening due diligence venture funds review and evaluate hundreds of business opportunities over the life of the fund and use predetermined criteria to identify which opportunities to focus on as possible investments this allows them to quickly flag the ones that fit and indicate that they will spend more time and money evaluating typically for each  opportunities reviewed ten will receive a detailed review stage  and stage  of due diligence and the fund may invest in one of them most opportunities do not make it through screening for two reasons the opportunity does not fit the fund’s mandate or criteria eg the business’ stage geographic region size of the deal industry sector some funds will only review opportunities that have come via a referral from a trusted source stage  business due diligence once the opportunity is determined to “fit” the fund’s investment criteria the deal is assigned to a junior and senior member of the team who will investigate further to determine the viability of the deal each firm may have a specific process but it tends to involve reviewing the management team market potential the product or service and the need it meets and the business model stage  legal due diligence once the fund has reached the stage of moving toward a favourable decision their lawyer will complete a legal review make sure that your lawyer is prepared to answer their questions the advisors you choose can reflect favourably on you including your lawyers so do your research to find the right ones ask for references to determine which firms investors respect and use themselves if the vc is highly experienced in this area or has inhouse legal counsel they may take on part of the review to reduce the overall deal expenses tips for startups on due diligence prepare due diligence binders once you’ve decided to raise money from outside investors take the time to prepare due diligence binders assign the coordination of binders to one person who will keep track of information and update documents when appropriate having due diligence binders ready will demonstrate to the potential investor that you are prepared it will also speed up the review process using these business and legal checklists enables you to anticipate most of the information requested respond quickly and professionally to any additional investor requests remember that they are evaluating the content of your response as well as how you respond to the various requests as part of the assessment consider due diligence your process too after an investment you will experience both good and bad times and events might not unfold as planned make sure that this investor can become a longterm partner assign a point person for communications have one person coordinate the responses to the vc this ensures the consistency of your messaging to the investor answer your investor’s questions thoroughly as you answer an investor’s questions circle back to make sure that you’ve provided a complete response take the opportunity to see if the investor is still warm to the deal it is better to find out early that they are not likely to invest use feedback with other investors take the feedback you receive throughout the process to course correct with other potential investors it’s likely that one group’s concerns may come up with other investors build trust with your investor getting through the due diligence process is an important step to successfully raising money but also a critical part in the development of a relationship with the investor during this process you’ll build trust and establish the groundwork for an ongoing partnership a positive outcome of the business due diligence process should lead to

llc be a joint venture by jeff franco jdmamba related articles difference between joint venture  multi member llc how do i register an llc for multiple members llc business partnerships jurisdictions within the united states allow for the creation of a limited liability company structure to run the operations of a business there is no restriction on the number of owners who are eligible to become llc members before or after legal formation for this reason the llc may be an appropriate entity choice for a joint venture that has multiple investors ready to start your llc start an llc online now becoming a member at the time of formation any number of members may hold an interest in the llc once legal formation is complete the authority to admit new members rests with all current members an llc often has an operating agreement that all current and future members must adhere to the agreement may stipulate current or future property and service contribution requirements to acquire a membership interest the number of votes necessary to admit a member and the limitations on a member’s authority for example new york’s llc law expressly defers to an llc’s operating agreement to determine how a member may acquire an ownership interest in the business if the agreement does not stipulate these requirements or does not exist most states only require a unanimous member vote to admit a new member member liability one of the key advantages of creating an llc for a joint venture is that each individual member has no personal liability for the debts and obligations of the llc or for the actions of other members whose activities are beyond the scope of normal business operations in the event an llc is unable to pay debts or satisfy contractual obligations members are not personally responsible if llc assets are insufficient however many states impose personal liability on the individual member who causes damage to others as a result of gross negligence or an illegal act such as fraud even where the llc is liable for those acts that member is in turn also liable to the llc for the expense or loss it incurs due to that members actions tax advantages an llc created as a joint venture receives a default designation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes partnership taxation rules impose passthrough principles and limit each member’s tax liability to his proportionate share of llc earnings the llc must file an annual partnership tax return however each member receives a schedule k and reports his share of taxable business income members must report all k amounts on a personal tax return and pay the appropriate tax in the event a member fails to comply with tax reporting or payment requirements the other members are not responsible for the deficiency partnership taxation is also advantageous in that it is not subject to the double taxation a corporation is subject to operating agreement although most jurisdictions do not require it its a good idea for a joint venture llcto have an operating agreement in place that defines each member’s scope of authority in making decisions affecting the business and procedures for settling disagreements efficiently having an effective operating agreement allows members to focus on running a profitable business rather than managing each other ready to start your llc start an llc online

rounds see this november  article on timecom “from dumpster diving to running a  million company” in the last ten years i had the opportunity to build icontact from a twoperson startup to a employee company with a million customers and  million in annual revenue at icontact we raised  million over the course of three rounds of funding m to the balance sheet and m in secondary liquidity during the process i learned a lot about venture capital one of the most important principles about raising capital at least from my perspective is to get as far as you can without raising capital oftentimes an entrepreneur will come to me with an interesting idea but really nothing more he or she will say “i just need  to get started” i’ll reply “that’s great however before you go out and seek  which you might be able to raise after nine months of work you’re probably better off incorporating your company getting your domain name set up creating business cards getting your website going creating a product prototype and finding your first customers yes that will probably take you a few months to do but if you raise capital after creating an initial product prototype and finding your initial customers you’ll be able to raise that capital to a much higher valuation than if you’re just raising capital off an idea alone” instead of planning to raise  and then getting started plan to raise  from your own savings and close friends and incorporate figure out how to convince people to work for you for next to nothing in exchange for equity and deferred salary create a product or service that you can sell start selling use the revenue you are making to finance future product improvements and development once you get to  per month in sales or  users in a consumer webmobile startup then go look for seed funding to improve your product scale up your model if needed it can be very challenging to raise capital until you really have a team established and a company that has a product so it’s important to learn how to bootstrap bootstrapping simply means bettering oneself by one’s own unaided efforts building something from nothing the act of “creating something from nothing” cannot be modeled in a goldman sachs spreadsheet it is the magic that entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial engineers have this is definitionally what entrepreneurs do–bring together the resources of land labor capital and entrepreneurial ability to create something of value that is greater than the cost of the sum of inputs and sell it to the marketplace it may take you a year or more to get your business to  per month in sales that is okay generating revenue for your business without much outside capital is really hard it is supposed to be there are millions of people with great business ideas but only a select few perhaps  can take their idea and execute by turning them into something that people will pay for over and over this difficult process filters out talkers from doers most people are talkers investors know that investing in someone who has figured out how to create something from nothing creating a solution to a need that people will pay to have solved provides a much higher chance of generating a return than investing in someone who just has an idea and “needs” your money to even get started entrepreneurs who simply “can’t” get started on anything until they get lots of funding must learn to become much more resourceful and figure out how to pull together an initial product that customers will pay for or at least a prototype that proves there is demand once you get to around  per month in recurring revenue it will be so much easier to raise equity funding don’t wait until you are there to start building relationships with investors—but do wait until your business has existing revenue before you actually ask for their money you will receive much better terms and give up a lot less control and ownership firms like instagram that sell for hundreds of millions of dollars without generating revenue are extraordinarily rare and unfortunately have the side effect of inspiring lots of companies to get started and invest time in a product that has no way of generating revenue how to bootstrap at the beginning at icontact we bootstrapped for the first three years from  to  i met my business partner aaron in october of  at the carolina entrepreneurship club’s first annual meeting at unc chapel hill we began working right away on turning the his preation list builder into intellicontact which later became icontact an email marketing software program in the summer of  after my freshman year i decided to live in the office sleep on a futon and cook on a george foreman grill we did everything we could to keep our expenses low while we built up our revenues built out our product and built up our customer base at the end of my first year of college i had saved  and i was living on about  a month between my car payment and food i didn’t have to pay rent as i was staying in the office i lived on that  i’d saved and both aaron and i deferred our salaries for the first three years it was a great moment when we got to a million dollars in sales three years later which contractually stipulated that we would get paid the salary that we had deferred learning how to bootstrap—how to live on just a little—is very important to entrepreneurial success because we bootstrapped for the first three years when we finally did raise capital we were able to raise it at good terms that’s what enabled us to control the company and direct it for years to come in the beginning do whatever it takes to keep costs low and make as much progress as you can on as little capital as you can even if you have to use some personal funds or funds from friends and family keep your costs to a minimum and get along the path towards success before you go out and raise angel capital or seed investment capital preselling product through kickstarter and indiegogo a new trend is preselling your product on kickstarter and indiegogo as a way of raising money for your firm kickstarter usually only allows technologyhardware products if you are building a technologyhardwareart product go with kickstarter otherwise check out indiegogo pebble presold  million worth of watches in  through kickstarter my friend lisa curtis presold over  in nutrition bars to launch her company kuli kuli the downsides of crowdfunding campaigns include having to reveal a lot about your product to competitors months before you’re ready to deliver and that you are then tied into a promise to deliver product at a prepaid price before you are sure what your unit costs will actually be the upsides include a relatively easy way to raise  or  to get your first sales find press and attract new team members into your business angellist fundable and wefunded recently a new wave of sites have come out following the passage of the jobs act in the united states that allow individuals to invest directly in private companies you can now raise money for your startup online using angellist fundable and wefunded there were over  startups currently raising funding on angellist the last i checked when you’re ready for outside capital after you’ve bootstrapped for as long as needed to develop your product and prove that users are actively using your product you are ready for capital or you may come to a point where you just can’t get any further without some additional expenditures—whether you need to pay people or purchase certain intellectual property licenses or purchase hardware when this moment comes where you look for capital depends on how much you need and how far along you are where should i look for capital this is a question i often get asked by aspiring firsttime entrepreneurs so i created what i call the green matrix which shows where to look for capital depending on how much you need and what stage you have reached if you’re looking for less than  credit cards your personal savings friends and family are great places to start a chart of the various forms of capital available at each stage of your company loans some people say “well i’m just starting my company and i’m going to apply for a  loan from a bank” what we found at icontact and what most people find is that unless you have an asset to securitize that loan to provide collateral in case you default it’s often very difficult to get a loan until you have revenue once you have revenue and especially once you have profits banks will lend you a lot of money as the saying goes money is only available when you don’t need it banks are often the most conservative institutions which we appreciate when it comes to being able to safely deposit our life savings with them but that doesn’t help startup businesses so initially you’ll need to turn to credit cards your savings and your friends and family angel investors once you’re looking for more than —which might be after you’ve built your initial product prototype and you have a couple of employees who are working for sweat equity—then you can start going out to what are known as angel investors and super angels angel investors are high net worth individuals who will invest between  and  in your company in exchange for an ownership interest that can be done through an equity investment or something called “convertible debt” which is a shortterm loan that is turned into equity if and when the company raises further venture capital in a series a offering of shares through an institutional firm like a venture capital fund super angels are just super high net worth individuals whereas most angels might be hard pressed to put in more than  i’ve seen super angels who are able to invest  or even  million in a venture these are often people with significant assets who can put up that kind of money knowing that it represents only  or less of their total assets getting to know those super angels and angels is often quite difficult it takes an investment of time spent networking in the community talking to other entrepreneurs who have been successful in raising capital and building relationships with them you can also go to venture capital conferences or  other gatherings that bring together investors with entrepreneurs incubator programs like techstars or y combinator are another way to connect with angels and super angels angellist is one of the best ways to share your pitch directly with high net worth individuals venture capital once you have raised your seed round of funding and perhaps gotten to the point where you have your product and have users or even have customers and you’re ready to raise half a million dollars or more that’s when you can start going to early stage venture capital funds this is what is known as your series a round of funding as you go into your second round or third round of funding your series b and you need between  and  million known as growth stage venture capital then mezzanine debt opens up to you once are five or six years in to your growth you have built out your product and generated more than  or  million in revenue and you’re looking for more than  million going to late stage venture capital funds and private equity shops is often possible if you ever end up needing more than  million which will only happen if you’re trying to do something very technologically complex or if you’re a large publicly traded company then you can go to large private equity funds or public markets like nasdaq and the new york stock exchange and sell shares to the public in exchange for investment in your company you can do a private investment in a public entity or a pipe through an investment bank or you can issue corporate bonds which are interestbearing notes from large companies through an investment bank regardless of where you seek capital a rule of thumb that i think is an important one for most companies to follow is do your best to avoid raising too much money where i draw the line when possible is don’t raise more than your current annualized revenue of course that may not be possible before you have a product you might need  or  before you can actually get to the point where you have any revenue—maybe even a little bit more but once you have some revenue then i wouldn’t raise too much more money until you have gotten your revenue increased what we did at icontact at icontact we followed the advice i’ve been sharing here we bootstrapped for the first three years then in  when we had  million in revenue we raised  from idea fund partners in durham north carolina in  a year later we had grown our revenues from  million to a little over  million and we used that initial capital to ramp up our online advertising and really build out our executive team then we went out and raised  million from updata partners in our series a so we had our seed round from idea fund partners and then our series a from updata partners and we still had followed the rule about raising less than x our annualized revenue in  when our revenues were just over  million we raised a  million round of funding from jmi equity some of that round went to early shareholders and investors and most of that round went to the company itself all together along the way we raised a total of about  million in  when we sold the company to vocus we were at about  million or  million in revenue by following this rule of raising no more than x our current annualized revenue as we grew we ensured that we maintained control of the company this allowed us to have leverage and negotiating power as we structured and negotiated each of our term sheets with the three or four investors that we had your negotiating power your negotiating power is based on a number of factors such as your level of need for the money your previous business experience and success the people around you and their experience the quality of your advisors the product and technology the market the competition and particularly the competition for your funding if you are considering multiple term sheets oftentimes you can greatly increase the valuation and greatly improve the quality of those terms whereas it might be fashionable to go out and raise a  million round of funding before you even get started and it might even be attractive if you could raise that  million on a  million valuation and only give up half of your company in order to get to the point where you can have all that money in the bank and be able to start generating a number of jobs and employees i often advise people to wait in the first couple of years get your product to market get user feedback improve it through rapid prototyping and get to a minimal viable product first too often i see companies raise    million before they even have revenue or before they even have millions of users i encourage you to avoid that if you want to control your company and control your own destiny term sheets when you receive an investment proposal from a venture capital fund you get what’s called a term sheet a term sheet is a summary of their desire to invest in your company and the terms at which they want to invest the most important terms on the term sheet include valuation option pool size liquidation preferences founder revesting veto rights the type of preferred stock whether it’s straight preferred or participating preferred and the number of board seats i’ll explain each of these terms below many entrepreneurs think that valuation is the most important term and that the highest valuation is the best valuation what i have learned in my experience as an entrepreneur is that while valuation is an important term it is only one of many important terms you shouldn’t simply take the term sheet with the highest valuation on it there are often other terms that end up affecting the true return of the investors and the true cost of capital for your firm and you need to factor in things like firm reputation firm access to ipo markets and firm experience in addition to the terms in the term sheet terms in a typical term sheet let’s briefly go through each of the key terms you’ll find in a typical term sheet valuation is simply the price at which a firm is going to invest in your company if they’re investing  million at a  million valuation they’ll end up owning approximately onethird of the stock because they invested  million in a company that’s now worth  million option pool size is the amount of additional stock that the venture fund requires you to create in order to provide incentive structures for future employees that come into the company for an early stage company in their early stage investment a venture fund might require an option pool as high as  or  in later stage investments particularly once you have revenue and you’re going after your series b or series c the option pool requirements are more typically in the  range liquidation preferences simply means that in the case of company liquidity in other words if the company goes bankrupt and the remaining assets are turned into cash who gets those assets first often liquidation preferences are for dealing with the downside scenario in a capitalization table or capitalization chart which is simply a chart of accounts for who has put money in the form of equity and debt into a company and who owns shares in that company often the debt providers are senior to the equity providers what that means is that in the case of bankruptcy the people who provided debt the creditors get their money out before the people that provided equity for most investors it’s important to be as high in the cap chart as possible so they may want to make their investments “preferred investments” which are senior in the cap table to common investors who have have common stock typically the employees of the company it’s important to pay attention to this question of who gets their money out first as you negotiate your term sheet founder revesting of shares is also an important term when you as a founder work at a firm for a number of years you often earn your equity over time when you provide options and stock to employees and to founders often you’ll provide it over the course of four years for example if you were to be earning  of a company’s stock over four years you’d probably get  every year on a monthly or quarterly basis but sometimes investors will restart the clock on your vesting of shares and force you to revest in many cases i find that to be unfair to the founders who have already earned part of their shares veto rights are another important topic to look at and negotiate carefully veto rights are simply what an investor can say no to and what they can stop you from doing it’s common for investors to have a veto right on something like the sale of the company or the issuance of a lot of new debt but you pay careful attention to what they can block particularly if there is a block on a merger or acquisition you don’t want a minority investor or shareholder to be able to block a deal that’s beneficial to the large majority of your shareholders type of preferred stock is another term you should pay attention to there is “straight preferred” and there’s something called “participating preferred” there’s a world of difference between these two in terms of how much return your investors get and how much your capital costs make sure you read up on what “participating preferred” means and try to avoid it stick with “straight preferred” as much as possible number of board seats is the final term you need to be aware of board seats are critical in terms of control of the company if you have a fiveperson board of directors and you your cofounder and someone you know and trust have three of those five seats then effectively you control the company particularly if you as the majority owner of common stock can appoint those seats when you start raising investment however investors may want one or more board seats depending on the amount of money they’re putting in you need to be careful because if you give up the majority of the board seats or more importantly the majority of the rights to appoint the board seats you will end up being at risk of other people besides yourself being able to make decisions in your company and even let you go as ceo particularly if you’re a firsttime ceo be very careful about giving up board seats the last thing you want to do is put years into building your baby and then allow some investors who don’t see eye to eye with you to let you go from your own company factors outside of the term sheet there are some other factors besides on what’s the term sheet that you should consider when selecting investors partner chemistry one of the most important factors to consider is simply your ability to get along with the venture partner—you chemistry so to speak the partner in this case is the person who’s going to be joining your board of directors and who is going to serve as your chief mentor during this process raise money from smart people you really like because ultimately you’re going to be more or less married to them in a business sense for the next three to ten years until they get their money back or you go bankrupt partner’s operational experience you also want to look at the partner’s operational experience in most venture capital funds the partners tend not to have operating experience what that means is that they haven’t run a business or even been part of clevel team they’ve simply been investors financiers and while investors do gain valuable experience through being on the boards of many different companies if they haven’t run a company they can’t understand what it’s like to be an entrepreneur and therefore they won’t understand the nuance of the important components needed to mentor a new entrepreneur i’d encourage you to only take money from partners who have operational experience or if you’re taking money from a fund that has some partners who have operational experience and others who don’t make sure that the partner joining your board has operational experience at least the one who’s going to be serving as your primary mentor portfolio alignment you also need to consider your alignment with the fund’s other investments known as their portfolio are there firms in their portfolio that you could partner with or potentially sell to someday successful exits pay attention to the history of successful exits from the firm and specifically from the partner that’s going to join your board of directors how many exits north of  million has that partner personally been part of how many exits north of  million has that firm been part of if you’re looking at raising capital from a fund that’s had fewer than ten investments turn into exits north of  million then that firm is either very new or they simply are not a good firm network look at the venture capital firm’s network building your team is the lifeblood of your likelihood of success so it’s important to work with funds and firms that have a network of operational executives at the cfo level the coo level or even the ceo level who they can bring in to help your company grow negotiating your valuation let’s talk about valuation guidelines for a prerevenue company a valuation can range all over the map depending on many factors at a tech company a software company or a life sciences company—the kind of company that has huge potential in the future—a prerevenue that is before you get any users customers or revenue valuation might be between  million at the low end and as much as  million at the high end depending on factors like the ceo’s past exits and results the team experience the size of the current user base the number of engineers in the company and the location of the company when it comes to valuations the old adage “location location location” is all too true if you’re in silicon valley between san jose and san francisco valuations are often double what they are in other parts of the world location is not just a matter of what’s trendy being in the right location is critically important because it enables you to attract better employees and executives and offers you better access to ipo and ma markets in areas like silicon valley firms densely congregate in a way that enables you to have a much greater chance of eventually exiting the company here are a few a sample valuations our first company is a businesstoconsumer type of company run by a first time entrepreneur with one engineer their premoney valuation is going to be pretty low between  and  million that doesn’t necessarily mean that company is worth  to  million that simply means that some people may be willing to invest at that valuation in order to take a chance that their company would be worth much more in the future our next example is a company run by firsttime entrepreneurs but these founders have been through a good incubator like y combinator they have a great idea and a couple of engineers in the six months it might have taken them to go through the incubator and refine their idea and get an extra engineer they may have more than quadrupled the value of their company many companies will get stuck in the first six months and end up going nowhere having made it through that phase this company can raise money at a valuation of  to  million even though they are still in the prerevenue stage our next company is run by an experienced ceo who has ten years of clevel executive experience has already had an exit north of  million and has five engineers already working now we’re talking about a premoney valuation in the  to  million range—not because the company is necessarily worth that much today but because many people will take a risk that this entrepreneur will be able to build a company to be worth much more than  million or  million in the future and therefore might invest  million on the  million valuation for a onethird ownership in the company postrevenue guidelines are of course different than prerevenue oftentimes they’re based on revenue multiples that revenue multiple might range from x at the low end to x at the high end depending on factors like the amount of revenue the revenue growth rate the number of users and customers whether the revenue is recurring revenue services revenue or product revenue the experience of the team and ceo the market you’re playing in and the location of your company building a pipeline of investors as you go about your fundraising generally you want to create a competitive process to do this you need to build a pipeline of potential investors and have a number of meetings as many as  or  meetings within a period of two to three weeks you may need to have initial meetings six to nine months before you’re really ready to run your process and then have those meetings again when you’re ready you want to build your funding process to ensure that within the period of a week you will receive multiple term sheets typically when you get a term sheet it will only be “enforceable” or valid for a few days so you need to drive different firms toward the same timeline and create a competitive process so that you can increase your valuation and get better terms when you begin negotiating valuation as you receive term sheets you need to have comparables fresh in your head—valuations of firms that are similar to yours look for companies that have had similar venture capital deals exits and ma deals and that play in a similar space to yours if you’re at the point where you have revenue look for companies with similar revenue multiples and profit multiples if you’re prerevenue look at similar venture deals that the particular fund or other funds have done in your area while you consider all these factors remember that you don’t want to take a valuation that’s too high that’s a mistake i’ve seen many entrepreneurs make when they have a choice between raising capital on a  million valuation or a  million valuation there’s obviously a huge temptation to raise money at the much higher valuation because then you give up less ownership in your company and you’re diluted less however when you raise money at a an overly inflated valuation what can happen is that the pressure coming from your investors to produce a return for the limited partners and general partners in their fund ends up creating a stressful environment in which you can’t be productive so while it is good to maximize your valuation and create a competitive process and get great terms don’t push your investors too hard to increase their valuation otherwise when they get to the other side of the table you’re suddenly going to find investors who are under a lot of pressure and that won’t make your life easy know your customer unit economics before you raise institutional money it’s important to calculate your unit economics before you raise multiple millions of dollars of venture financing you want to figure out how much it costs in advertising etc to acquire an additional customer if you take your total ad spend and divide that by your total number of new customers per month that is your customer acquisition cost as i’ll discuss in more detail in the next section how to acquire customers when you understand how much it costs to acquire an additional customer and how much it costs to produce an additional unit of whatever you’re selling and how much revenue you earn from that customer over that customer’s lifetime you’ll be able to be ready to raise venture capital at series a or series b level because at that point you’ll to know that for example every  of investment will generate  in revenue and it will be worthwhile use of capital to summarize my key advice on raising capital wait to raise your series a until you have revenue that is growing predictably each month raise just a small seed round until you have proven mathematically that a certain amount of investor dollars will amount to a multiple in dollars back don’t raise money until you know how you’re going to use it and you’ll end up controlling your destiny and controlling your company and being able to be much more creative with a lot less stress in your life at the end of the day equity capital or venture capital is the most expensive type of capital you can raise so only raise what you need and make sure you know what you’re going to use it for before you take it on video on raising venture capital ˇ click here to watch a video on raising venture
