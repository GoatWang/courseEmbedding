in july  when the georgiapacific corporation spun off the wholly owned subsidiary after georgiapacific had acquired  small firms in the southern united states the federal trade commission ftc accused the company of becoming a monopolist in the softwood plywood industry as part of its settlement with the ftc georgiapacific agreed to divest  percent of its assets william h hunt a vicechairman at georgiapacific was selected as louisianapacifics first chairman in  harry a merlo who had been chief executive officer of lp since its foundation succeeded hunt as chairman while remaining ceo prior to the official spinoff of lp georgiapacific had transferred several of its operations to lp ownership including its samoa ukiah intermountain weatherseal and southern divisions as well as its  percent investments in alaskas ketchikan pulp company ketchikan spruce mills inc and ketchikan international sales company however georgiapacific had kept most of its lowcost timber reserves and the bulk of its tree farms for itself thus the newly independent lp had to scramble for raw materials particularly timber as the july   portland oregonian explained this proved to be an especially difficult task as timber shortages wracked the entire industry overcutting japanese demand for logs and pressure on the us forest service to tighten harvesting restrictions on large trees caused prices to soar to make matters worse lp lost  acres of harvestable oldgrowth timberland with the expansion of the redwood national park in northern california merlo strove to shepherd the company through its early difficulties lp acquired several lumber companies in california oregon montana washington missouri and alabama and in  it purchased the fibreboard corporation a manufacturer of products used in making furniture and cabinets in  the company bought fifteen buildingmaterial centers in southern california from lone star industries which provided lp with much needed distribution centers a breakthrough productedit to ensure its longterm success however lp would need to compensate for its comparative dearth of southern pine and douglas fir timber as well as lumber production to address this shortfall lp turned its attention to the development of wood products derived from lessexpensive and fastergrowing trees such as cottonwood and aspen as merlo told the portland oregonian in  we recognized that the days of making wood products from big trees were numbered for both economic and environmental reasons in the late s the company began manufacturing osb by slicing logs into wafers mixing the wafers with resin and then pressing them into sheets first introduced under the trade name waferwood later rechristened innerseal this new product line revolutionized the construction industry by offering a less expensive stronger alternative to plywood sheathing and subflooring after opening its first innerseal mill in  lp advertised the product as the smart mans plywood expansion during the sedit lps osb products protected the company from some of the vicissitudes of the timber market buoyed by this success the company soon expanded its line of products made from reconstituted wood to include ibeams for floor joists and rafters these structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts yet were stronger and lighter lp also introduced a concrete form of innerseal and in  began to market innerseal siding for the exterior of homes driven by these breakthroughs a housing boom and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products lps sales grew  percent between  and  according to the portland oregonian during the same period its profits increased  percent moreover osb products accounted for an escalating portion of the companys total sales only six percent of sales in  the innerseal line by  amounted to almost  percent of total sales volume lps sales of lumber—once the mainstay of the building industry—decreased from  to  percent over the same period in  the company purchased kirby forest industries and the california properties of timber realization company from these transactions lp gained almost  acres of timberland which helped balance the land taken in  for redwood national park lp received a final payment of  million from the government for this land in  in  lp bought weather guard inc a manufacturer of housing insulation made from recycled newsprint as well as mitek wood products a north carolinabased producer of laminated veneer lumber and engineered wood ibeams the early sedit during  sales and profits in the companys softwood lumber plywood and building products areas slumped due to weakening demand this situation was attributed to an economic downturn increasing concerns over the us federal budget deficit and fears about the unsettled global geopolitical environment the construction industry suffered because of bankers reluctance to finance new projects and consumers decisions to delay home purchases housing starts for  fell to  million the lowest level since  and down  percent from  lp responded to these developments by curtailing production at many of its plants and increasing exports of its specialty building products the pulp market also experienced slowing growth in  after a fouryear period of rapidly rising prices pulp manufacturers then faced eroding profit margins due to worldwide economic problems and larger than normal inventories although lp saw its own pulp sales and profits peak in mid and expected only a minor recovery in  the company continued to operate three pulp manufacturing mills one mill supplied paper pulp to nonintegrated paper producers a second mill produced dissolving pulp for manufacturers of rayon and cellophane products the third and newest pulp mill using a bleached chemithermo mechanical pump process revolutionized pulp production by eliminating the use of chlorine and operated in a completely closed system without discharge into neighboring water supplies this mill marketed its output to manufacturers of printing and writing papers lp was able to rebound from the downturn of  while its competitors struggled in the face of dwindling timber supplies lp enjoyed record sales in   and  much of lps growth in the s came through acquisition of other building materials companies such as abtco in the eastern united states and forex in eastern canada according to the spokane journal of business lp was flourishing because it had vigorously developed alternatives to dimensional lumber and plywood indeed merlo told the wallstreet journal that technologynot oldgrowth timber resourceshad proven to be the companys lifeblood profits for  were up  percent from the previous year and in  the company achieved an alltime high of  billion in sales by that year only onethird of lps sales came from dimensional lumber—the studs and solid wood joists that frame houses—while over half its revenue came from osb products and another  percent from engineered wood products and pulp lawsuits threaten louisianapacifics futureedit despite its many achievements lp encountered a number of serious obstacles in the s foremost among these were lawsuits pertaining to its simulated cedar innerseal exterior siding during the s lp was the defendant in a major classaction lawsuit over its osb siding product known as inner seal manufactured from the early s through  the company had initiated the class action lawsuit to speed up the process and according to the judge presiding over the case got the most money to the most people in the quickest amount of time based on my experience many homeowners alleged that innerseal siding which carried a year warranty began to rot prematurely—discoloring disintegrating and even growing fungi the first claims surrounded the use of osb panels on the roofs of homes in florida following hurricane andrew in  some of these homes lost shingles exposing the osb panels to heavy rains reports claimed that the exposed osb began to deteriorate two years after the first suit lp had settled all related disputes lp reengineered the product now marketed as lpsmartside and since  has sold approximately  billion square feet of smartside siding with no warranty claims for fungal decay classaction suits brought by various collections of homeowners as well as the attorney general of minnesota were filed against the innerseal siding although lp admitted to no wrongdoing the company moved quickly to settle the cases at the close of  lp had paid over  million to settle osb claims and between  and  the company paid out an additional  million in  lp committed at least  million to a settlement with  homeowners who had used the innerseal siding in april  lp implemented a claimant offer program to speed payments to claimants in what was the largest classaction lawsuit in the history of the siding industry lp paid out more than  claims by the end of the settlement lp had paid almost  billion to satisfy claims lps woes did not end there however in  lp paid  million to settle a classaction lawsuit filed the previous year by lp shareholders who alleged that the company had violated securities laws by failing to disclose that the companys orientedstrand boards were defective as the portland oregonian reported on december   it was the largest securities settlement in oregon history also that year the company settled a  sexual harassment suit against merlo moreover the state of colorado brought a count indictment against lp in  charging fraud and environmental violations at its plant in montrose colorado the same year lps eightperson board lost confidence in the ability of merlo and his top two lieutenants to steer the fortune  company declared the august   edition of the portland oregonian merlo resigned and was replaced as chairman and ceo by mark suwyn a former executive at international paper rebuilding in the late sedit under this new leadership lp began the difficult task of regrouping the year  had been particularly difficult one in which the company endured a net loss of  million the market for building products had sunk as an influx of canadian lumber had flooded the united states high interest rates and poor weather which affected home building only exacerbated lps problems even more dangerous to lp however was the inauguration of several rival osb mills as osb increasingly replaced plywood as a basic construction material innerseal became less a specialty item exclusively made by lp and more of a building commodity faced with these new threats suwyn implemented a multidimensional plan for recovery first the company strove to eliminate unprofitable operations in  lp closed the ketchikan paper company as well as  plants and mills more closings followed in  and  and the company sold off a number of additional operations including the

to siding metal vinyl if youre thinking of new siding youre in for a treat — and a conundrum your choice will likely be a major upgrade in your homes appearance — thats the fun part on the flip side its not an easy decision to make there are lots of siding options and each presents a mixed bag of cost reliability ongoing maintenance and environmental responsibility heres what you need to know about options for new siding vinyl vinyl siding is tough and comes in a boatload of colors and textures because the color is throughout the material nicks and scratches dont show up sophisticated manufacturing techniques create products that do a surprisingly fine job of mimicking woodgrain lap siding wood shingles and even stone vinyl siding is lightweight and in many instances can be installed directly over existing materials so its a good retrofit option because its easy to handle vinyl installation can be installed quickly saving labor costs relatively new to the market insulated vinyl siding features a layer of expanded polystyrene foam providing an insulating value of r to r insulated vinyl is on the checklist of items that can help a house achieve energy star qualification expect to pay about  percent more for insulated versions of vinyl siding than regular upside the material requires little or no maintenance and dirt simply washes off never needs repainting vinyl has relatively low cost compared to other siding materials the best brands offer transferable lifetime warranties downside because the standard panels are  feet long the ends of the panels must be overlapped creating noticeable seams you can order extralong panels that reduce the number of seams but youll pay a premium of about  percent more than standardlength vinyl green meter the same stuff that makes vinyl so tough — polyvinyl chloride or pvc — lasts for decades if not centuries in landfills although many vinyl manufacturers claim that the material is readily recycled not many contractors take the time to remove and recycle used vinyl siding manufacturing pvc can produce dioxin and other toxins cost  to  per square foot installed expect to pay  to  to install vinyl siding on an average twostory house cibearcreekcedarsidingsx wood few building materials have the natural charm and beauty of wood clapboard and shingle siding prized for its warmth and workability wood siding is the choice for a premium renovation project wood siding comes in many species and grades what you choose usually depends on how you plan to finish the siding using a clear sealer or semitransparent stain highlights the grain but youll need to select more expensive grades of wood that are free of knots and other blemishes choose lessexpensive grades for use with paint or opaque stains with dedicated maintenance wood can last generations clear finishes should be reapplied every two years semitransparent stains every three years and paints every five years that kind of diligence adds up — a complete refinishing job is  to  upside wood is easy to cut and shape and can be installed by reasonably skilled diyers its a greatlooking material prized by architects designers and homeowners for its natural beauty downside better grades of wood can be pricey diligent maintenance adds to the overall cost retrofitting with wood siding requires removing existing siding materials green meter wood siding is considered a highly sustainable material that breaks down easily in landfills the best grades are made from oldgrowth timber to relieve the pressure on oldgrowth forests choose wood siding thats certified by the forest stewardship council as being harvested from sustainable forests cost clapboard siding  to  per square foot installed expect to pay  to  to have wood siding professionally installed on an average twostory house cost shingle siding  to  per square foot installed cijameshardieheatheredmossfibercementsidingsx fiber cement the current darling of the siding industry fiber cement has earned a reputation for stability and low maintenance its made from a mix of wood pulp cement clay and sand and it can be molded to mimic wood clapboard shingles stucco and masonry it readily accepts paint and most manufacturers offer an array of factoryapplied finishes upside fibercement siding resists expanding and contracting with changes in humidity and temperature so caulk and paint really hold up its fireresistant termiteproof and it wont rot a year warranty is the norm downside fibercement siding is flatout heavy and installation requires special techniques and tools that add to the cost finding a remodeling contractor with experience installing fiber cement can be a challenge retrofits mean completely removing the old siding adding about  percent to the overall cost green meter its extremely durable and has a long replacement cycle which scores points for sustainability however fiber cement is relatively new and that longevity has yet to bear out cost horizontal board siding  to  per square foot installed expect to pay  to  for an average twostory house istockstuccospanishstylehousesx stucco stucco is an extremely durable siding material that pairs well with other siding materials and adds a bit of architectural panache to a retrofit job todays stucco mixtures include epoxy which prevents chipping and cracking but installation isnt a diy job — youll need to look for an experienced stucco installer wellmaintained stucco will last a lifetime upside toners added to stucco mixtures result in beautiful organic colors that go all the way through the material making repainting unnecessary stucco is a lowmaintenance material thats resistant to fire and insects drawbacks theres a lot of prep work required before stucco can be applied finding a reliable experienced stucco contractor can be a challenge green meter new formulations of stucco use earth and lime instead of portland cement — cement production is linked to co emissions cost  to  per square foot installed expect to pay  to  for an average twostory house cilouisianapacificengineeredwoodsidingsmartsidesx engineered wood siding engineered wood siding is made of wood fibers and exteriorgrade resins its tough strong and can stand up to extreme weather conditions it comes in a variety of styles and textures including beaded lap roughsawn clapboard and lookalike wood shingles it comes readytopaint primed or with factory finishes engineered wood siding positions itself as a cheaper alternative to fiber cement and real wood but with similar durability some brands provide year warranties upside easy to work with no harmful dust borate compounds added to the mixture make engineered wood siding impervious to insects its half the cost of real wood siding downside although now backed by serious rd and warranties early versions of engineered wood siding experienced failures due to moisture problems resulting in classaction lawsuits newer varieties havent been on the market long enough to prove their longevity claims green meter binders are lowvoc manufacturing uses entire trees and select wood scrap so that production waste is minimal cost  to  per square foot installed expect to pay  to  to cover an average twostory house cieldoradostonefieldledgehomeexteriorsx synthetic stone synthetic stone is made in molds from a mixture of cement sand and aggregate modern manufacturing techniques ensure that the final product looks realistic it mimics any number of stone types — including granite and limestone — and the variety of shapes and styles includes split face dry stacked and round river rock although its not often used to cover entire houses its a popular choice as an accent covering lower portions of walls or chimney exteriors upside the look of real stone at a fraction of the cost lightweight so installation doesnt require beefing up foundation footings synthetic stone is fire and insect resistant downside although it costs less than real stone synthetic stone is still one of the more expensive siding options discerning critics say it still doesnt look like the real thing green meter inert
