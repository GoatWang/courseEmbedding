methodology  procedures definitions projects covered include stateowned and private projects in the infrastructure electric power oil  gas excluding upstream water and waste and mining sectors where applicable a project is considered as such until the end of construction and rampup to full capacity with the exception of mining projects where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project projects must have a a start date b estimate for completion c initial investment estimate data for stateowned projects initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts along with addendums and annexes if original contracts cannot be obtained information is taken from public documents presentations news articles from bnamericas archives and external sources in cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval in the case of private projects information is taken from public sources such as stock exchange filings annual reports company presentations third party research and press releases in judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source the greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a likeforlike comparison in project costs insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature no attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money validation in the case of stateowned projects validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium epc contractor a relevant state agency or advisors to either party currency projects costs are measured in us dollars where project costs are measured in a local currency amounts are converted to us dollars at the date of the relevant announcement signature or report severity of
