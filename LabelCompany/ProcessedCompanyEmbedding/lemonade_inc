wwwlemonadecom about lemonade inc lemonade insurance company is a property and casualty insurance company that is transforming the very business model of insurance by injecting technology and transparency into an industry that often lacks both lemonade creates an insurance experience that is fast affordable and hassle free lemonade uses bots and machine learning to venture into territory no insurance company has gone before an insurance product with conversational ui that will get you insured in no time unlike any other insurance company lemonade gains nothing by delaying or denying claims lemonade takes a flat fee so most claims are handled and paid instantly traditional insurance companies make money by keeping the money they don’t pay out in claims this means whenever they pay claims they lose profit this is why getting claims paid fast and in full is sometimes so hard lemonade was built differently by taking a fixed fee from premiums the rest is geared towards paying out claims in essence lemonade treat premiums as if they were still the policyholders money and returns unclaimed remainders in the annual giveback giveback is a unique feature of lemonade where each year leftover money is donated to causes their policyholders care about this way their customers enjoy amazing insurance and society gets a little push for the better our chief behavioral officer professor dan ariely says that “if you tried to create a system to bring out the worst in humans it would look a lot like the insurance of today” by becoming part of the b corp community rebuilding insurance as a social good rather than a necessary evil is now part of our mission working in partnership with nonprofits and baking giving back into our business model holds the promise of a better insurance experience and a more valuable insurance company the change we seek® most americans view insurance as a necessary evil lemonade powered by technology and driven by social responsibility changes that by removing bureaucracy making getting a policy and getting claims paid instant and pricing insurance so its affordable for everyone it goes further than that insurance used to be about communities coming together to protect each other when needed that sort of communitybuilding insurance lost its way lemonades giveback grows communities around causes they believe in every lemonade policyholder chooses which cause to giveback unclaimed funds to at years end making lemonade a great way to fundraise for nonprofits insurance should be a social good not a necessary evil what makes us a better
