 with a oneyear target price of  by dcf with x ebitda a  upside even though currently tencent is relatively fair valued the healthy ecosystem tencent has built over years would pave a steady path for further growth company background and industry overview tencent holdings limited sehk  a leading provider of internet value added services in china is the biggest gaming company by revenue in the world its main products and services cover social network web portal media ecommerce mobile games and online games in  with a  increase in total revenue  billion tencent became the th largest publicly traded company in the world furthermore tencent holds a significant amount of stake in other giant companies  stake of jdcom nasdaqjd one of largest bc online retailers in china  stake in tesla nasdaqtsla and  in activision blizzard nasdaqatvi the thirdlargest gaming company in the world tencents major competitor is alibaba nysebaba alibaba is focusing on bb and bc services through its taobao and alipay alibaba tried to transform its alipay into a personal finance platform however without social networking functions support people are reluctant to switch from tencents wechat payment to alipay until today alipay is mainly functioning as a third party transaction payment portal instead of an allinone app like wechat on the other hand as a search engine provider baidu nasdaqbidu is collecting traffic data trying to present a new picture of intelligent search for users and developers through big data cloud computing deep learning and other core technologies technically speaking baidu will not have any direct competition with tencent on many core businesses such as gaming and social network app further in the short term no other new entrants would have the technology innovation or financial scale to challenge tencent hence it is safe to conclude that tencent would hold its competitive advantage for a quite long time period investment thesis i am going long tencent for three reasons the healthy ecosystem created by its social network app the robustly growing gaming division and other diversified but lucrative products and services the healthy ecosystem created by its social network app tencents own social network app qq instant messager and wechat have created unparalleled competitive advantages for tencent unlike facebook nasdaqfb that has been confined to a communication platform geared towards advertisers tencents wechat platform evolves into a combination of a news publisher a social network app and a portal used for onlinetooffline commerce transactions there are  million monthly active users mau on wechat right now over  million of users make payments such as hospital bills and transportation fees through wechat which explained a lot why paymentrelated revenue increased by  to  million in  currently there are over  businesses accepting wechat offline payment instore and the number is still growing at an exponential rate according to a pwc research more than  of wechat users tend to spend more than  rmb per month on wechat  of wechat users open wechat more than  times per day and  of users check moments each time they open wechat all these healthy numbers indicate a greater future growth for tencent robustly growing gaming division tencent is dominant in chinese gaming industry accounting for half of the industrial revenue tencents gaming empire is mainly composed of two parts pc gaming and mobile gaming in pc games tencent owns three most popular games league of legends dungeon and fighter and crossfire the multiplayer online battle pc game league of legends lol alone has consistently been the worlds topgrossing pc game since  lol has generated more than  billion in   billion in  and  billion in  given the popularity of pc game and increasing professional esport game worldwide the strong momentum is more than likely to continue the other two games have a similar trend with little doubt to say tencent could continually monetize its advantages while further strengthening its research and development ability to deliver new popular pc games by acquiring supercell the producer of clash of clan tencent is also making a major bet on the future of mobile gaming industry on ios system portal along with several games in the pipeline tencent has six of the top ten highest grossing games in china according to idcs research china mobile games generated  billion of revenue in  the market is projected to reach  billion of revenue by  with current  market penetration rate and  market growth rate it is reasonable to assume that tencent could at least maintain its current position in mobile gaming which is around  billion therefore with such solid drivingforce tencents mobile gaming division should also have foreseeable decent revenue in the near future other diversified but lucrative products and services tencent is marching into the entertainment industry as well two of its significant productsservices are qq music and tencent video qq music is one of leading online music platforms providing legitimated music to chinese users it has more than  million of active users doubled from last year accounting for  of chinese online music market to further integrate qq music with chinese digital music industry tencent has formed an exclusive strategic partnership with many music publishers which only allows qqwechat users to have access to certain music the other lucrative productservice is tencent video an online video streaming website fully owned by tencent in november  it had over  million of subscribers which more than tripled yeartoyear basis inspired by the great success of netflix original show tencent has invested a variety of resources into developing its original tv series many of those original shows are played over  million times online coupled with huge viewer traffic and media exposure tencent allaround diversified productservice would definitely boost tencents future revenue iv conclusion chinas three biggest it companies baidu alibaba and tencent have diverged their development path towards different directions tencent with its unparalleled huge user base healthy ecosystem and cuttingedge rd team would firmly march to its next milestone no shortterm direct competition enables tencent to allocate more capital and resource on longterm return the recent investment in startup companies is a great example of tencents vision and goal it is not unfathomable that tencent could soon arm itself with one of americas bigname services the chinese giant might acquire activision blizzard or snap nysesnap as the stepping stone to full engagement in the north america market with its best talent loyal user base and abundant cash on hand

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
