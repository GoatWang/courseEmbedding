speaker the event was cohosted by the newseum institute’s religious freedom center the religious freedom and business foundation and tanenbaum center for interreligious understanding  by intellectual

of broadcasters was the gathering’s keynote speaker the event was cohosted by the newseum institute’s religious freedom center the religious freedom and business foundation and tanenbaum center for interreligious understanding as a public servant in oregon from  to  smith says he frequently accepted invitations to attend worship services of various faiths once after hearing a jewish rabbi’s sermon on the durable value of the ten commandments smith says he thought to himself “you know if the american people actually kept those commandments we’d have a lot less to do in the senate and we could certainly have a smaller government” smith encouraged religious people to “find some refuge in a concept known as ‘fairness for all’” he then quoted former us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes who said the us constitution was “made for people of fundamentally differing views” smith whose ecclesiastical assignment is as a seventy for the church of jesus christ of latterday saints also quoted from church apostle elder dallin h oaks’ october  address about the importance of engaging with those who disagree with us in a virtuous cycle of dialogue he shared these words from elder oaks “differences on precious fundamentals are with us forever we must not let them disable our democracy or cripple our society this does not anticipate that we will deny or abandon our differences but that we will learn to live with those laws institutions and persons who do not share them we may have cultural differences but we should not have ‘culture wars’” you can watch smith’s
