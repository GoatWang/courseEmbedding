our profitability and as we have discussed in the past we plan to steadily increase our operating margins to create additional value for our shareholders in the first quarter we saw strength in the large multiproduct deals demonstrating that the security fabric architecture is continuing to gain mindshare and marketshare for fortinet our customer and partners recognize that our competitors multiple point products and loosely integrated solutions do not provide the breadth depth performance and orchestration needed to address the demands of todays digital economy the fortinet security fabric is cohesive multiproduct platform that works together to detect monitor block and remediate attacks against the entire enterprise surface area responding to our customers need for a seamless tightly integrated approach to security that protects all points in the network enterprises do not have to sacrifice their network performance to ensure that their networks are secure in this highly competitive and evolving landscape our latest next generation firewalls the fortigate  series with the e e and e deliver ultrahigh speed next generation firewall and advanced threat protection in a flexible chassisbased formfactor based on the latest cp security processor many security vendors detect threats some prevent them with integrated solutions but only fortinet excel in all five stages of network security detection prevention integration performance and value as we continue to land and expand into some of the largest enterprise corporations and government organizations in the world we again added more than  new customers during the quarter this brings the total to more than  customers worldwide broader adoption of the security fabric also result in increased sales in the quarter of nonfortigate solutions during the quarter we were pleased to announce that several leading technology companies joined the fortinet security fabricready ecosystem including cisco hewlett packard nuage networks from nokia and more to date fortinet has  fabricready program partners representing a crosssection of leading information technology providers whose offerings are tightly integrated with the fortinet security fabric this open approach enable multiple vendors security solutions to share actionable threat intelligence and mitigation information in realtime we are also pleased to announce early this month that fortinet has extended the core capabilities of our security fabric architecture to enable businesses to experience the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence in cloud environments as they do in their physical networks the latest enhancement of the fortios  offers customers the ability to manage security capabilities across their private public cloud and softwaredefined wide area network sdwan environments early this month fortinet and vodafone announced a new global relationship to provide next generation security solutions to enterprise customers by embedding fortinets highperformance virtualized security solutions and integrated security fabric architecture within vodafones core network products our strength in cloud offering is driving demand for onpremises implementation of the fortinet security fabric by providing the highest performance most complete and wellintegrated solutions the fortinet security fabric has positioned fortinet as an innovator and the market leader i will now turn the call to drew to review our first quarter financial results and forward guidance andrew del matto thank you ken now let me now share our financial results for the first quarter which can be seen on slide  fortinet had a strong start to  with billings and revenue exceeding the highend of our guidance ranges billings increased  yearoveryear to  million reflected in this number is approximately  million from a single deal closed in the quarter approximately  of the revenue from this multiyear contract was deferred into future periods revenue of  million was up  yearoveryear revenue growth was driven by strong performance in north america particularly in enterprise demonstrating ongoing improvement in sales productivity as ken mentioned we saw success in large deals and in multiple product deployments demonstrating adoption of the fortinet security fabric deferred revenue grew strongly again to  billion up  year over year reflecting the business shift to more margin rich recurring subscription and service revenue sales of enterprise bundles were again strong in the first quarter driving higherpriced and highermargin recurring revenue over time our nongaap gross margin was  our strategic focus on driving sales of higher value higher price and highermargin recurring revenue streams such as services and virtualized product offerings contributed to our improved gross margin in the quarter nongaap operating margin was  and nongaap earnings per share were  finally we generated  million of free cash flow during the quarter an increase of  over the first quarter of  our first quarter results benefited from customers recognition of the value performance and comprehensive security coverage provided by fortinets security fabric this was evidenced in the first quarter by continuing strength in large multiproduct deals and sales of nonfortigate products to enterprises the number of deals over  grew  deals over  grew  and deals over  grew  the majority of our large deals were attributable to the key differentiators of the fabric particularly manageability orchestration and integration across the enterprise for example in the aforementioned multimilliondollar multiproduct contract with a large educational institution fortinets technology beat out the incumbent and other competitors not only due to performance but also to the manageability and integration capabilities that the fabric provides in another first quarter deal fortinet is being deployed in a large european financial institution whose incumbent security solution was not scalable powerful or manageable enough to respond to its growing business and larger attack footprint the customer chose fortinet security fabric for our ability to provide internal segmentation and advanced threat protection in the context of a scalable wellorchestrated high performance solution cloud solutions are a critical component of the fortinet security fabric and represent a significant expansion opportunity and longterm driver of our growth fortinet delivers security to the cloud and for the cloud the latest enhancements to the fortios enable customers to manage security capabilities across their cloud assets and software defined wireless access networks we also announced this month the launch of forticasb a cloud access security brokerage providing customers and partners with an interface to gain visibility and control over saas applications through the fortinet security fabric turning to our quarterly sales results the breakdown of billings across our top five verticals was service provider at  government at  education at  financial services at  and retail at  on a geographic basis billings in the americas grew  led by the united states which outpaced all other regions in the first quarter validating the changes that we made to our sales structure just a yearago emea billings grew  and apac billings grew  now turning to billings by product portfolio on slide  highend products accounted for  of total product billings our midrange products accounted for  and our entrylevel products accounted for  revenue was  million in the quarter up  yearoveryear as you can see on slide  revenue performance was driven by the combination of  yearoveryear product revenue growth and  yearoveryear services revenue growth the continued shift to higher services growth reflects our ongoing success in driving higherpriced subscription bundles metered model business and virtual solutions on a geographic basis from a revenue standpoint you can see on slide  and  that revenue continues to be diversified globally which remains a key strength of our business revenue from the americas represented  of our business and grew  yearoveryear revenue from emea represented  of our business and grew  yearoveryear and revenue from apac represented  of our business and grew  yearoveryear during the first quarter our nongaap gross margin was  nongaap services gross margin was  nongaap product gross margin was  we continue to focus on productivity and efficiency in our operating model paying close attention to the growth in billings versus operating expenses on a yearoveryear basis in the first quarter billings grew by  while sales and marketing expense grew just  by just  as expected general and administrative expenses were elevated in the first quarter due in part to preparations for our implementation of the new revenue accounting standard in all yearoveryear we had  million of incremental billings on just  million in incremental operating expense as a percentage of revenue on a nongaap basis sales and marketing expenses were  down from  in the first quarter of last year research and development expenses were  flat from last year and general and administrative expenses were  also flat with last year total nongaap operating expenses were  million during the first quarter resulting in nongaap operating income of  million or  of total revenue up  basis points yearoveryear nongaap net income for the first quarter was  million or  per share based on approximately  million diluted shares outstanding as expected the annualized nongaap tax rate declined to  as seen on slide  and  we ended the first quarter with a strong balance sheet including  million in cash and investments free cash flow in the quarter was  million an increase of  over the first quarter of  annualized inventory turns for q were  inventory turns were lower than expected in the first quarter due to early receipt of  million of inventory that was scheduled for q delivery and due to a ramp in inventory for our transition from the d to e series of appliances we expect to normalize our inventory turns to  or better over the next several quarters deferred revenue increased to  billion an increase of  million or  yearoveryear dso was  days before i discuss guidance for the second quarter i want to provide an update on our real estate plans as i mentioned on our fourth quarter call we are addressing our facilities requirements over the next several years both at headquarters in california as well as in vancouver at the beginning of the year we guided  million to  million in capex for  including approximately  million on real estate earlier this month we concluded the purchase of the vancouver building so the vast majority of the real estate capex for  will occur in the second quarter affecting our q free cash flow we expect to return to strong free cash flow generation in the second half of the year let me now finish with our guidance for the second quarter and updates to our previously issued guidance for the fullyear which can be seen on slide  i will also address our plans for longerterm operating margin expansion as a reminder all forwardlooking statements including all of the guidance statements provided are subject to kellys cautions at the start of this call fortinets market opportunity and competitive advantage is significant our investments have helped lay the foundation for our future growth share gains increasing profitability and shareholder value creation as i have mentioned our model is shifting toward more marginrich services revenue which tends to have a higher ratio of deferral these factors along with typical seasonality of the business and our expense structure are carefully factored into our nearterm outlook for the second quarter of  we expect billings in the range of  million to  million revenue in the range of  million to  million nongaap gross margin of  to  nongaap operating margin of  to  and nongaap earnings per share of  to  we are updating our guidance for the fullyear  to reflect the first quarters performance for  we now expect billings in the range of  billion to  billion revenue in the range of  billion to  billion nongaap gross margin of  to  and nongaap earnings per share of  to  we had approximately  million of overachievement in nongaap operating income in the first quarter which equates to approximately  to  basis points of operating margin on the fullyear at the middle of the range we are adding that to our nongaap operating margin expectation for the year id like to conclude with some commentary on our longerterm operating model as you know over the last couple of years fortinet has carefully considered our investment strategy to find an appropriate balance between high revenue growth and profitability we made critical investments in sales and marketing to broaden our go to market capabilities and focused on driving higher margin recurring revenue streams in  these efforts delivered nongaap operating margin improvements of approximately  basis points exceeding our operating margin guidance despite the dilution from the acquisition of accelops we remain focused on driving higher sales productivity and maintaining a flat organization we also have made a number of model and productivity improvements and changes to our operating structure to increase profitability as our q results illustrate we are seeing the benefits of our focus efforts and strategy we meet with shareholders frequently and have heard from many of you that you would like more clarity and definition related to our path to operating margin improvement in response to this feedback and recognizing the importance of increased profitability to our business and our shareholders we are updating our margin targets as well as the milestones we expect to achieve to get there we plan to add  to  basis points to operating margins each year following  reaching a minimum nongaap operating margin of  by  and remaining thereafter in the  to  range we appreciate our shareholders feedback and we welcome an ongoing dialogue with you on how to improve our business and increase shareholder value now ill hand the call back to ken to close ken xie thank you drew we are very pleased with our first quarter results and with the progress that fortinet is making the fortinet security fabric is winning in the marketplace and we are gaining market share against our competitors we believe the longterm operating model that drew just outlined will bring the best value to our shareholders our first quarter results illustrate that our strategy to expand operating margin is working and we believe our model will continue to offer improved profitability and value to our shareholders while allowing fortinet to remain an industry leader in closing i would like to thank fortinet employees partners customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support kelly blough operator you may now start the qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from gabriela borges with goldman sachs your line is now open gabriela borges great good afternoon thanks for taking in the question congrats on the solid results maybe ill pick up right where the prepared remarks left off on the new operating model drew ken maybe you could just comment on how you arrived at that plus target in the  timeframe and how you think about what the right level of revenue growth will be as you progress from where you are now today to that  level thank you andrew del matto sure gabriela yes i think were  first of all historically i think a while back we were in the mids we felt like we could get back there and if we look around the industry we thought that was closer to a longer but term ph benchmark that made sense for us we know where we made the investments i think weve been saying all along that we like the flat model and the changes that we made over the last year and they appear to be working and so i think now the kind of stage two of that is really the path into driving higher productivity and operating margins over the next years as far as revenue growth i mean without getting into that we continue to want to take share we believe our model supports doing that historically weve done that and we think we can do that while also expanding margins at the same time ken xie yes also the security fabric story also starting and hence the sales i mean for the crosssell for the upsell opportunity and also we see the security at isp or the security processor also starting as a long advantage over competitors that all can help in keeping expanding the margin also help increase the growth gabriela borges great i appreciate the color thank you operator our next question comes from melissa gorham with morgan stanley your line is now open melissa gorham great thank you for taking my question i would want to maybe start with the deal that you mentioned at the beginning drew i think it was a  million deal and im wondering if you can maybe just provide a little bit more color as it seems pretty significant for you all is there anything that you can talk about in terms of whether it was a competitive displacement and is it fair to assume that that was a multiyear deal and was that embedded in your expectations coming into q andrew del matto well it was a competitive win and the customer was really looking for a longterm model in their next generation architecture over the next say five to ten years and it was competitive displacement the fabric were the key  the fabric and performance were the keys to winning it and yes it was a longer  it was a multiyear deal i mean what else did you ask im sorry melissa gorham was this embedded in your expectations when youre guiding q this deal andrew del matto we take variety of factors into account for the forecast to the extent thats in the funnel that its weighted into the forecast decision melissa gorham okay got it and then just one quick one on the operating margin guide so for fy  youre still looking for about  basis points yearoveryear improvement but it seems like the longerterm guide is looking for a little bit more of an improvement after fy  so im just wondering why the modest operating margin improvement in fy  is that just conservatism or is there some other factor to take into consideration andrew del matto well actually we picked up a little bit this quarter i think we left in the table  for rounding but we picked up about  million that were going to get back that will go back into the margin improvement for the year i think its just  to  basis points i think we had a paragraph on that in the script if you will and so we wanted to give the overall performance back the other thing weighting if you add that to the  million for the revenue implementation i think you get fairly close to  basis points for the year melissa gorham got it okay thank you andrew del matto yes operator our next question comes from sterling auty with jp morgan your line is now open sterling auty yes thanks i want to actually ask about competitive landscape i apologize i missed the first few minutes of the call if you did comment but given all the news coming out of the various vendors in the quarter et cetera what are you seeing in terms of the competitive landscape anybody getting weaker anybody getting stronger any changes in who youre seeing in that kind of final shortlist in deals ken xie sterling this is ken i think in the big environment we dont see much change compared with the last two years and certain vertical space like some bigger provider carrier they probably spend more time to planning some agencies ph where they transition to some cloud some other service offering model other part where the enterprise smb with uc is pretty strong and also the new product we offer in the emodels starting to ramp up pretty quickly also helping on the competitor side i dont see much changed were starting promoting we call the security fabric we have a pretty broad probably broader than other competitor on the product portfolio here not just network security but also the other part like for endpoint with the access part with the application like web and email security and then to the cloud so we have quite a broad offering so the fabric start really help and compete better compared to other competitors so other than that i see the whole environment pretty normal andrew del matto yes sterling its drew i would just summarize that and that i think the consolidation theme remains profound out there and the fabric is clearly resonating and the larger deals we do its common theme and i think thats very consistent with what we saw in q and consistent with what wed see going forward ken xie yes i think some  and some like  we also improve in the sales productivity like by two points compared to one year ago its  or  andrew del matto i think indiscernible has a percent on ken xie a percent indiscernible andrew del matto yes but productivity i dont  yes productivity was good yes sterling auty and then just one followup how would you answer  the one question that i get on a frequent basis is okay as we look at the shift to the cloud moving to these virtual environments fortinet is long been known for having your custom asic and gives you performance advantages et cetera how does fortinet then compete in the world of aws and azure and public cloud providers in that situation ken xie like in my script we mentioned about we offered the best cloud and also together with the onpremise solution so the cloud starting generate a lot of interest they grow faster but on pretty small base right now on the other side customer also evaluate  it can give them some flexibility but dont have to  i mean saving the cost or maybe even increase the certain risk because you have actual data in the cloud and also have to increase the bandwidth for accessing the cloud so there is always a sort of balance point and whether using see some cloud also using some onpremise thats where the hybrid solution probably will be the best so customer can like changing their like a balance point based on their need at certain point so i think cloud have to offer certainly flexibility but there is other part need to be considered so that i believe the vendor side they need to offer both and if only one part of it its more difficult to meet customer demand sterling auty got it thank you andrew del matto yes and its also  right now its helping pull through onpremise for us as well sterling ken xie yes also the new security processor also being used by lot of cloud provider service provider because they can drive much better performance and efficiency policy when compared with the traditional cpu they can easily improve the performance like  to  axiom ph then consume like a few percent of the power consumption so there is a lot of advantage and also in the smb in the  at our branch office to access the cloud thats where the lowend we see pretty healthy growth also sterling auty that makes sense operator our next question comes from mike casado with pacific crest your line is now open rob owens great sorry to disappoint this is actually rob owens in for mike casado so hi guys a couple of things  dovetailing sterlings question a little bit so thanks for the color on the competitive landscape can you also talk about where you think we are in terms of the firewall cycle are there still firewall cycles is there any anticipated refresh we are starting to pick up through some of our channel work that people are looking optimistically at next year so just some broader color in terms of where you think we are in terms of an overall industry refresh cycle first thanks ken xie i think that refresh cycle probably we see the buying pattern in like two years ago kind of  we call the rush buying now newly the network security equipment probably will survive for four five years and then they start gliding ph the cycle there i think a few are like under one two three year to go but also the service providers under like a lot of us being branch office we also see pretty strong demand and also because the cybersecurity is always the most important part of it the total percentage also keep increasing so we do see the overall market growing pretty healthy and a lot of existing customers they also want to expand beyond just the traditional firewall thats where the fabric the security fabric stories starting working much better than just to refresh the firewall so basically you can cover from endpoint to the access to the networking side with traditional firewall doing and also the application and then the cloud so thats where tie all this together has a much better solution feature compared to refreshing so we see all these studying kind of helping the growth andrew del matto rob we were talking about this earlier today actually and we always thought that target if you go back  i think it was late  that was really the kick off for the last big i think spike if you will in the spending and then it went on for couple of years obviously and that when you get into  thats four years roughly from say that happened and then understanding ph it started to happen in  early  i think probably somewhere in  you would begin to see that click in the four to fifteen ph i think the consolidation theme probably does create an opportunity from the fabric perspective for us and thats really how we are thinking about this opportunity rob owens great i appreciate the color and then second if i look at your sequential services revenues i guess going back historically it was flat up or down a couple of percent but last year you saw a spike sequentially from q to q in services so maybe talk about why this is more normal seasonality and remind us what happened in that yearago period q  that drove that services spike and i apologize if this was referenced earlier i was late to the call thanks andrew del matto the services spike  i actually think that the answer this year is probably more due to q this year we had a softer q and so you dont see as much of the registrations come through in q when you would expect the revenue to lift up start amortizing rob owens thank you ken xie also we starting offer the what we call the enterprise bundle which has more service component but one year ago that also started helping to see the service percentage get higher now operator our next question comes from walter pritchard with citi your line is now open walter pritchard hi thanks ken could you talk about the nonfortigate business the size of that and how you are thinking about that kind of mediumterm in terms of how large that may be come as a percentage of your revenue ken xie the nonfortigate side grew faster than fortigate and also feed in the total solution covered a whole infrastructure is that just some network side looks much better i dont think we disclose the detail percentage yet but its starting to get  definitely grow faster than the fortigate drew any data we can… andrew del matto yes walter i mean i dont think we are giving numbers out but i  generally speaking thats been the story for the last couple of quarters where weve seen a nice uptick on the fabric and then illustrated the nonfortigate project  products thats doing well we also look at the number of fabric customers if you will and thats been growing very nicely and nice trend there which adds to it and then finally the enterprise bundle again it was a very strong story in q and very consistent with last several quarters so we are seeing a lot of consistency in kind of the themes internally around productivity seem to be lifting and part of it doing just do selling multiproduct deals selling nonfortigate products up selling the bundle the enterprise bundle and so very good on that front walter pritchard andrew just a followup here is it fair to say that if that business were more than  your revenue you would break it out was nonfortigate andrew del matto yes we havent decided on that one walter walter pritchard okay thank you operator our next question comes from jayson nolan with baird your line is now open jayson nolan okay great thank you and drew i wanted to followup on the updated operating model it seems like sales and marketing were offer the most longterm leverage and i guess on the question is whats the change now versus the previous guidance is the expectation for your headcounts ads going forward and sales are changing and how you market the products or any more color there would be great andrew del matto well a couple of things like i did think you want to start with the top line jayson so we are doing  the strategy around creating the higher margin higher price recurring revenue streams thats obviously coming through you could see in the billings and you could see in the deferred revenue we expect that drive value to the gross margin line over time and then as you move down in to sales and marketing thats where the bulk of our investments or if we go back historically thats where we want to see the productivity and the way you get there is some of the things you were taking about jayson but really what to trying to do is give them opportunity to sell more at higher price and so i think we are doing well on that firm we just talked about the nonfortigate sales and the fabric sales so thats one dimension of that then the other thing we didnt if you look at the pivot we made in august to really go to what i would call a flatter very customer centric sales model that part is working very well and from customer centric i mean we are very focused direct touch reps versus overlays and very direct se coverage more direct contact with the customer we still have  we are still very focused on the channel but we have just more direct customer touch and that was the focus really scaling up the augment functions over time and thats where you would have less headcount over time on those functions we also think the marketing the gotomarket and to the marketing is working training helps you got higher productivity through training we made investments there those are beginning to scale and show fruit in terms of the fabric sales and just the higher productivity overall so thats really the story there when you look down the line on rd and ga you probably expect to go a little more out of ga over time then rd certainly the revenue project goes away at some point for instance and we should see those benefits over time ken xie yes also there are some change in the whole environment i think you can see in the last few years some competitor were aggressively to the marketing sales its very difficult to sustain the longterm and if you  right now the whole inventory ph study more look in how to be a little bit more efficient healthy model and sustain longterm as also like we also believe this longterm model probably can would be better for the shareholder and for the company also jayson nolan ken make sense and then followup like ken on asic refresh calendar any color you can provide on refresh around the network processor it seems like it would be important for the highend of your customer base ken xie yes we have a three security processor like pretty much every year there is one new come up because on average it takes about three year to build the security processor so the cp we just mentioned like come up study helping the high end especially to  series and there is also ioc and thats in the network processor i think they are not directly impact revenue because they still needed some to build into the product and then we refresh products like few products every quarter pretty smoothly steady helping the growth but you can see the latest offer we made on a  series that leverage latest security processor cp can help the performance grows a lot and then we probably see the other next generation like ioc that also can easily improve the performance multiple times thats also what keep the cost the same thats also helping the growth a lot but i say while keeping probably on average one new offering or regression ph per year on the security process side jayson nolan thank you operator our next question comes from ken talanian with evercore your line is now open kenneth talanian hi guys thanks for taking the question so first i was wondering if you could discuss any changes that youve made either your hiring processes your systems to better manage your opex andrew del matto well ken we are very focused on making sure that we look at every open headcount rack and every  the background  everyone coming in the door and thats part of the flat structure that we are talking about were ken and myself and lisa our vp of hr are all focused on looking at every rack and every person comes in the door and there background makes sure its fit we also evaluate where we are and i think the key here is you want to bring people in you want to make sure that they are going into place we feel there fertility and opportunity for them to be productive both near and longterm and so thats we are really trying to do and then balance the purchase investments we have over time in to their roles and last thing i would add is when you think about the ramp of this you want to do it in the way that doesnt create disruption because clearly if you go too fast it just becomes disruptive and thats how we think about but we really want to keep a flat organization very much and weve been saying this for several quarters now later focused on productivity and that is the primary driver ken xie and also the mid operation margin we have achieved that in  so we have reached a level before and then just in the last few years we kind of more invention of growth now kind of more go back to the normal and take care both the profit and the growth side kenneth talanian okay and i just curious if the economy were return negative over the next few years or the security market were return would you be willing to forego top line growth to hit those margin targets ken xie i think in the industry for like  plus years sometime even when economy goes slow we are not impact security that much because if you want to keep the security and also security is pretty sticky and is it difficult to replace the cost could be higher andrew del matto ken i think the  look the answer is you obviously want to step back and look at whats going on in the industry but we are very focused and committed to driving the higher margins i mean thats the model we are operating under and again we are trying to ramp there in a productive way if you will we feel like weve done a very good job of building the model we wanted to do over the last couple of years in terms of our go to market adjustments that weve made you will find those and then you are very focused on the higher margin recurring revenue streams which are also coming in so that thats what we are going kenneth talanian okay thank you very much kelly blough and i want to say weve got about  more people lined up for questions so if i may have to try to restrict people to single questions going forward and then we can followup again on the second call please operator our next question comes from michael turitz with raymond james your line is now open michael turitz hey good evening to drew and ken and kelly so very good to see the milestones on the margin and the guide to  to  bps after  but let me take it from this margin question with slightly different perspective which is  why in theory couldnt we get to  plus margins even sooner and when you were at mids margins when you are much smaller company growing with less scale and growing over  so whats different about now whats change that you actually have to invest in a higher rate you couldnt get there even sooner in that andrew del matto well michael i think you want to balance productivity again disruption the impacts in the risks of disruption weve done a very good job of rebuilding the model we believe we pivoted to the enterprise and thats doing very well and you want to continue to drive those higher margins and we are going to look at everything we can to achieve our results are better but i think you have to be very careful to avoid disruption and i think some people seeing that recently some others have seen that and so i think thats part of the issue because thats going to be very damaging both short and long term michael turitz okay thanks andrew del matto youre welcome operator our next question comes from andrew nowinski with piper jaffray your line is now open andrew nowinski all right thanks for taking the question so your product revenues remain well above your peers even today check point called out strength in the small and midmarket yet they only had  growth in product revenue this quarter and obviously palo alto seeing some product revenue to decline so can you just give us any color on us to what drove of the strength in your product revenue this quarter and then kind of what you are expecting that to stay at through fy  for based on your new guidance ken xie yes i think some of the new product like whether the emodel and also some highend product offer to the big enterprise service provider is to help drive the growth and also we have a quite big installation base i think based on idc probably like more than  total global installed deploy ph base is a fortinet foritgate solution there so thats also having  keep in driving and we also keeping refresh the product which like  said earlier like every few years customer also need to refresh product to get a better performance more function that also helping to drive with product growth and then the service also because the new products offer additional function additional service thats also kind of helping to drive the longterm service growth andrew nowinski got it and then what level youre expecting for the remainder of  and keeping in this highsingledigit andrew del matto yes we dont  unfortunately we dont guide on product revenue andrew there is the one thing i would mention is there we try to  i think we were try to be helpful with the mix shift in q and it was about  we thought about  to  basis points of product revenue is now reflected on the services line if you think of it its being more software thats ratable more metered model those appear on the services line and then also with the enterprise bundle you end up reattributing through accounting more of the product up from the invoice on to the services deferred revenue and then amortizing over time so do you measure that thats probably close to  bps thats really now that yearago probably going to showing up on the product line its now showing up on the services line andrew nowinski got it thank you andrew del matto so big number yes operator our next question comes from indiscernible with barclays your line is now open unidentified analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question here drew ive got a philosophical question for you maybe slightly different way of asking mike turitz question earlier but what factors went into updating the longterm model we certainly appreciate the path and the milestone but were just  i was just wondering is it something that  is it part of sort of a normal fiveyear planning type of process or what went to kind of thinking about profitability even beyond the original fiscal  target andrew del matto philosophically we were just  i think its the next stage of the company if you go back a few years we took down the margins really because we wanted to build out an enterprise sales force and a broader gotomarket model so to speak broader gotomarket model that took some investment and we refined it along the way and we feel now as weve gone through a couple of quarters here a year past i think reorganizing if you will the sales force in the us and we feel like were doing very well there is also  and we felt like the maturation of the model would then provide the benefits that we were hoping for all along and we look at that obviously we model it we look at the vectors of that clearly the mix shift on the gross margin line is helpful looking at productivity and you look at the natural ramp for it over time also i mean we received a lot of shareholder feedback to be frank and we want to make sure that one we show we appreciate our shareholders feedback and we continually focus on creating  increasing shareholder value so we appreciate everybodys feedback thats very helpful unidentified analyst fair enough thanks very much drew operator our next question comes from shaul eyal with oppenheimer your line is now open shaul eyal thank you good afternoon guys congrats on the solid set of results drew solid performance in the americas i know you guys dont break out the us contribution within the slides but can you provide us with some qualitative description of fortinets progress in the us during the quarter whatever color you can share with us thank you andrew del matto yeah the billings growth from the us was very good it was about  and so again thats where we made a lot of the investments and whether you  when you look at that kind of nearterm and longerterm thats  you get very comfortable that we start to get very comfortable with the productivity and improvements in the things we talked about in the rebuilding the gotomarket model and the refinements we made over time it feels like the numbers indicate that that is going in the right direction shaul eyal got it thank you operator our next question comes from catharine trebnick with dougherty your line is now open catharine trebnick thank you congratulations on the quarter mine is more on the service provider venue it seems like a lot is the next generation implementations in their core networks will be nse sdn like and what should the architecture that fortinet has that would be most apt to go after that type of opportunity ken xie that were both on the new  series also with the new release fortios  offer a lot out as a function or lastly the sdn and network functions virtualization thats where we get a lot of our feedback from the service provider from the cloud provider the customer which we integrate into the  both the new hardware and also the new software andrew del matto and then catharine we constantly engage with our cloud and carrier team and ask them what to expect and they continually tell us that were in all of the top careers were working with them on their architectures and the breadth of portfolio the fabric matters and obviously historically performance matters but we can help them whether its virtual or physical and the other factor that we tend to see is just that whatever  they want to run their businesses inside out so what theyre sharing  what theyre using or providing to their customers they also want to run their systems on and run their business and we feel like were in those top prospects theyre forthcoming catharine trebnick okay thanks and ill save some more up for the next call thank you gentlemen kelly blough thanks catharine operator our next question comes from erik suppiger with jmp securities your line is now open john lucia hey guys thanks for taking my question this is john on for erik i was just looking at your headcount additions it looked like you added  headcount per quarter over the last three quarters it looks like the lowest level since  so firstly is this intentional or would you like to be adding more headcount in that and then secondly is increased attrition weighing on your headcount growth or has attrition remained constant over the last year andrew del matto erik we evaluate the headcount based on the value they bring back to us so again were doing a couple of things were trying to make sure were covering the right opportunities both from a customer perspective and then also from an rd perspective and then the various other things we need to do to grow and scale the operations but were very focused on looking at the headcount requisitions that we open and they tie to that model that they bring back an appropriate incremental return so that one that it makes sense term but also longterm then ken myself and as i said lisa vp of hr look at every hire that comes in the door from a resume perspective and what theyre doing and i think we just become increasingly focused on  we said several quarters ago were laser focused on productivity and we continue to do that and we feel like that mode of operation that process is working very well john lucia so should we expect  going forward  headcount additions going forward this quarter andrew del matto well we really been guiding on operating margin erik john lucia okay thank you operator our next question comes from patrick colville with arete research your line is now open patrick colville thanks for taking the question so the guidance implies for billings and revenue pretty steep sequential deceleration can you just help me understand what i might be missing so that kind of manifests itself because momentum is really strong andrew del matto a couple of things patrick one clearly if you think about our business and now its changed over time first of all our smb channel business is fine its very consistent and its been doing very well weve gone more into the enterprise and what happens then is you now have inherently a more  i hate to use this word but lumpiness to the business and it just tends to be more pushed towards the end of the quarter and so were trying to do our best to adjust for any of that in terms of timing and take that all into account and any given quarter you can get one or two large deals that can dramatically influence the results and for instance this quarter we had the university the deal that we spoke about earlier the  million  theyll be slightly north of  million and so that can happen were just trying to take all those things into account when we look at it patrick colville okay great thanks nice work andrew del matto yes operator our next question comes from fatima boolani with ubs your line is now open fatima boolani hi thank you for taking the question drew just wanted to double click on the comments you made around productivity its very evident in the results that the changes youve made and the investments youve made have been paying off but im curious if you can maybe qualitatively talk about sales force tenure and attrition levels especially as weve now anniversaried patricias changes in north america so any qualitative color around that would be very helpful thank you andrew del matto yes i think weve done a  fatima it feels like weve done a great job of hiring the right people to approach the enterprise and so thats worked well we dont  typically arent going to share exact tenure statistics but i would say that statistic has improved since q i think when we did share some so we feel like were better positioned and were seeing that more consistent performance over time and i really think thats the key driver just getting people in the c getting them trained and the consistent performance ken xie yes also the marketing side also has and starting helping contribute in the result and then also we offer probably the best training and the biggest training program in the industry thats where both on the customer and the partner and also even our own sales force side also was starting benefit from other  the training program we did fatima boolani very helpful thank you operator and we have time for one more question it comes from the line of tal liani from bank of america your line is now open unidentified analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question this is mike on behalf of tal so billings growth rate was solid this quarter up  but your guidance is calling for deceleration to about  in the second quarter can you give us little color on any other areas in your  or what are the areas in your pipeline are contributing to some of that deceleration thanks andrew del matto hi mike fatima asked a similar question just a minute ago so let me repeat what i said and then maybe add a little bit on to that there are various elements or parts of our business if you will dimensions and so think of this smb as being a fairly consistent flow of business and so that one tends to be a little easier to predict if you will weve been more focused on the enterprise weve been very successful there were seeing the uptick in larger deals what goes along with that though is it tends to be more of the deals falling into quarter end closer to quarter as enterprises are very good at pushing you to that to get the best deal and so that timing the lumpiness and timing that goes along with that are really addressed in how we guide were thinking about that very closely as we guide what i would say there was a larger deal that we mentioned during the quarter and i think if you adjust for that a little bit and you come off of  youll come into a more what i would probably consider a historical sequential range for us from q into q and hopefully thats helpful mike unidentified analyst thanks andrew del matto yeah operator i would now like to turn the call back over to ms kelly blough for closing remarks kelly blough thank you everyone im sorry we couldnt get to a couple of questions

ceos to begin with a solid business model which can help immeasurably during difficult economic conditions when you have money people are more willing to give you money but when you need the money desperately people look at you as a troubled company a cash cushion will give a ceo the freedom to think about the company’s longterm goal once a ceo is thinking long term they can avoid the pitfalls that come with some short term decisions such as laying people off which could ultimately harm longterm goals a ceo should also be prepared to invest in their product and not take shortcuts i am a

for building a great team ken xie ceos today must invest in their employees as they are the engines that drive the growth of the company i advocate being more open and more trusting of your employees be visible to them give them the authority to make decisions and don’t micromanage help to guide them into the career that they envision and foster employee initiatives that have a positive impact on their community this kind of model fosters teamwork and to be successful you have to work together because no matter how much you may want to you can’t do everything yourself rake narang what are the challenges of managing a global business ken xie displacement of an entrenched incumbent is always a challenge but this is also one of our best opportunities due to the fact that when compared to many of our competitors our solutions perform significantly better in terms of security efficacy and system performance we also encounter competitors that have tremendous brand equity partly due to the fact that they have been around a long time we are able to work around this challenge by working closely with thirdparty testers it’s hard to argue numbers which is why we defer to independent labs to verify our performance another challenge is the speed of innovation occurring in our market factors such as byod shadow it and the consumerization of technology is forcing businesses our included to rearchitect how they manage users enforce policy and secure data on the other hand because of these changes coupled with the fact that hackers cybercriminals and online threats are more pernicious than ever we see unprecedented growth and opportunity as these dynamics converge rake narang what are some of the trends you’re seeing in technology company investments this year ken xie the cloud is one area where we see businesses making significant investments this technology presents a variety of new opportunities for fortinet and its competitors ranging from how we leverage our own cloudbased technologies to make networks more secure to actually developing the solutions that help secure the cloud infrastructure bring your own device byod is another interesting trend organizations of all sizes are struggling to deal with the proliferation of smartphones and tablets that need to connect to their corporate network end users from the ceo down to line workers want the ability to use personal devices for work purposes their belief being that personal devices are more powerful flexible and usable than those offered by corporate the big question many vendors are wrestling with today is how to properly secure them advanced persistent threats apt is another technology that is forcing a number of vendors to address head on apts are highly targeted attacks that take a muted and often slow and prolonged approach to penetrating an organization with the aim of gathering intelligence rather than making immediate financial gain software defined networks sdn still in its infancy is

predictions sm directory global excellence volunteer as expert register awards about   ken xie what’s ahead for unified threat management and nextgeneration firewalls fortinet nasdaq ftnt helps protect networks users and data from continually evolving threats as a global leader in highperformance network security we enable businesses and governments to consolidate and integrate standalone technologies without suffering performance penalties unlike costly inflexible and lowperformance alternatives fortinet solutions empower customers to embrace new technologies and business opportunities while protecting essential systems and content rake narang the term nextgeneration firewall ngfw has been around for more than two years now what’s beyond ngfw ken xie if we think back to the original driver for ngfw it was really the rise of internetbased applications and content that drove the need for greater visibility and control of ips and application control beyond the traditional port and protocol controls of the traditional firewallvpn since then internetbased applications have been joined by public and personal cloud services as well as mobile devices of all types to dramatically change the nature of the “enterprise”  as a result we are seeing emerging requirements—still in line with the original goal of establishing visibility and control—to enable and secure the new enterprise for example to address this rise in mobile devices and byod many of our customers have started leveraging strong authentication tied to users rather than devices at their ngfw control point due to newer password cracking tools faster processors and alwayson internet connections the single plain text password has come under fire enterprises today must migrate to a two factor authentication model and this dynamic enterprise is evolving at a time when cyberthreats continue to become more targeted and sophisticated  the rise of advance persistent threats apts which can circumvent traditional security technologies is spurring customers to integrate advanced threat protection atp or “sandboxing” with their ngfw such attacks target specific people or functions within organizations infiltrate from multiple vectors such as phishing attacks and web drivebys and use extensive evasion techniques to remain stealthy for long time periods before exfiltrating data new ngfw solutions must include a robust combination of proactive detection mitigation and actionable threat insight about ken xie in  ken realized the performance limitations of software firewalls running on pcsservers and then started netscreen as founder president and ceo he lead the company to develop the industrys first asic and dedicated hardware systems for high performance firewalls and vpns in  after recognizing that firewalls and vpns alone could not stop content and application network attacks such as viruses intrusions spam and malicious web content ken founded fortinet fortinet pioneered unified threat management utm  a market which fortinet leads and has quickly grown to be among the largest segments in the network security space   rake narang the unified threat management feature set hasn’t seen broad evolution in recent years where do you see the market heading ken xie there are several emerging trends that are driving the utm market today that are logical extensions of some trends that have been around for several years these trends are focused around advanced visibility and control expanded access to the network and integrated security with regards to advanced visibility and control utms today need to offer the advanced threat protection that customers have come to expect from enterprise firewalls customers today expect products to have features like granular policy enforcement of applications users and devices as well as ondevice and cloudbased sandboxing for advanced threat protection in terms of expanded access to the network we’re finding utm customers are connecting more devices their networks and they want the utm to manage that access customers want their utms to manage switches wireless access points and gg extenders  and they’re asking for power over ethernet poe support to their utm devices as well to enable easy deployment of point of sale pos terminals ip video cameras voip phones and so forth enabling these devices to be extensions of the utm instead of standalone devices or systems is a critical aspect to simplifying customers’ networks customers are also asking for integrated security meaning they want to have a single point of control for all network traffic including wireless since so much data is accessed via mobile devices today it is essential that customers have an integrated wireless controller and singlepaneofglass console to ensure consistent enforcement of all traffic rake narang what’s the future for cloud security what is fortinet doing to secure the cloud ken xie security is consistently the number one concern when extending applications and data to the cloud  enterprises are already eagerly adopting virtualization and private cloud internally and empowered business teams are rolling out marketing and usercentric initiatives more quickly and assuming unlimited elasticity  this is pushing faster and unpredictable network bandwidth so fortinet is not only increasing performance but rolling out highspeed gbe and gbe interfaces across the product line enterprises are faced with additional concerns when hosting workloads at cloud providers like aws or leveraging saas applications including shared multitenant environments and ensuring consistent security policies  for example how to maintain visibility in the public cloud without installing hardware on the provider’s network                     fortinet has triedandtested appliances for enterprises but has also have released a broad line of virtual and cloudhosted security offerings that can be deployed everywhere without the need for dedicated hardware going forward cloud security will also have to become more efficient scalable and easytouse with simplicity in mind fortinet’s cloud solution entails a central webbased console to manage individual or aggregated fortigate devices network availability is critical to a good end user experience fortinet’s cloud solutions enable users to monitor the fortigate network in real time with various alerting mechanisms to detect and pinpoint potential issues meanwhile cloud solutions will have to keep pace with increasingly stringent compliance regulations to that end fortinet’s cloud solutions offer a slew of preconfigured and customizable reports that can be tailored to meet an organization’s exact specifications rake narang so focusing on cloud security when is it possible to use classic solutions and where is it necessary to implement new solutions ken xie in general data entering and leaving the cloud should be subjected to the same level of scrutiny as any other data entering or leaving the network in that sense traditional network security technologies such as firewall intrusion prevention application control and content filtering should be applied to provide that basic level of scrutiny   also cloud environments like physical environments require regular updates to the security architecture to repair vulnerabilities and ensure sustained defenses against malware and other threats as with physical infrastructure the cloud should be equipped with a comprehensive global intelligence network and frequent updates that identify and protect against new vulnerabilities before they are exploited in the wild   however the additional challenge associated with securing data in the cloud is that the security architecture must also secure the multitenant nature of the traffic as such security architecture must have the ability to enforce separate policies on traffic depending on origin or destination in that regard nontraditional security technologies must be established to keep traffic entirely separate and avoid any risk of unauthorized access   we are also working with our service provider partners to enable new solutions  for example to secure increasing mobile devices that access cloud services and bypass the internal network we delivered more security and inspection for carrier lte networks  we also enable mssp’s and cloud providers to deploy and offer our securityasaservice to secure instances in public clouds rather than forcing all tenants to bring their own security virtual appliances company
