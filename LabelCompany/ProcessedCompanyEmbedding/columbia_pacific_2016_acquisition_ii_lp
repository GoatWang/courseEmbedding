download pdf  asiapacific private equity record results gathering clouds looking back over the past year it’s hard to imagine a more perplexing global economic landscape oil prices unexpectedly plunged to record lows global economic expansion slowed currencies fluctuated wildly—and then there was china as the growth rate of the world’s secondlargest economy fell amid continued export weakness a staggering  trillion in wealth evaporated on the shanghai stock exchange between midjune and the end of august  resulting in deep economic uncertainty about future gdp growth across the asiapacific region and beyond related insights suvir varma record results gathering clouds in asiapacific private equity global private equity report  industry expertise private equity yet amid the growing turbulence the asiapacific private equity industry posted one of its strongest years on record in  see figure  deal value spiked to  billion soaring past ’s previous record high exit activity at  billion remained robust despite the extreme volatility in the equity markets fundraising was on par with the historical average and the industry left no doubt about its value to investors returns from past investments grew across the region extending the momentum begun in  limited partners lps were cash positive for the second year in a row as general partners gps found ways to return capital with improving returns as we emphasized last year this virtuous cycle of capital invested and capital returned is a critical sign that private equity in the asiapacific region has matured significantly from the overexuberant years between  and  there are other signs of foundational strength as well our research indicates that gps in the region are increasingly winning pathtocontrol provisions in their deals enabling a more activist approach to their portfolios portfolio dynamics are also improving steadily even though the industry is laboring under a large overhang of unrealized capital lps meanwhile continue to flock to the topreturning funds extending a multiyear flight to quality that is weeding out the underperformers and leaving a clearer field for the winners all of this adds up to a much stronger more resilient industry but the obvious question is whether the momentum of the past two years can continue as the macro story deteriorates the industry is wading into unfamiliar territory—namely a slower growth environment where it will be much more difficult to find good companies improve their performance and exit them with marketbeating returns even a more resilient industry may have trouble grappling with the serious challenges ahead for now pe funds continue to find deals as equity markets fell in  investors saw massive opportunities in publictoprivate transactions such as the china renaissance–led  billion buyout of qihoo  technology sovereign wealth funds swfs and other large institutional investors have also remained active in the asiapacific region giving resourceful gps the opportunity to participate in a series of megadeals that might not have been available otherwise at the same time more company owners looking to fund growth or to retire are warming to the pe value proposition which is increasing the pool of potential investments and while many traditional industries have languished the internet sector has bucked the downturn and continues to present attractive growth prospects the problem is that when growth is no longer supported by a rising economic tide it creates difficulty for pe firms in two ways first it puts pressure on existing portfolio companies many of which funds bought at high prices assuming strong growth second it becomes increasingly difficult to gauge the potential for new companies and invest in them at reasonable prices not only do slowing growth and low visibility make it hard to predict future earnings growth but the market remains fiercely competitive pushing deal multiples higher indeed data shows that despite the meltdown in the equity markets over the past year average multiples of pebacked transactions in the asiapacific region rose almost  to  times enterprise valueebitda given the market’s headwinds it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that many investors are buying into a falling market a trend that may very well put stress on future industry returns it’s clear that the market’s turbulence is ushering in a new normal in the asiapacific region characterized by slower growth new economic drivers and greater regulatory uncertainty but we also believe pe in the region will continue to draw keen interest from those investors looking for emerging market exposure because pe has a longer time horizon than other asset classes and fund managers have more direct control over their investments the industry has historically outperformed other investment options especially in times of turbulence that is not likely to change what is different is that investors are no longer willing to trust their capital to any but the most productive funds the flight to quality that began several years ago has only gained steam amid slowing growth challenging gps to rise to a new level of performance looking at the top funds in this difficult environment we find that the winners share three broad characteristics they have stormproofed their portfolios by dialing up their focus on portfolio activism investing heavily in the people and capabilities needed to maximize the value of their highestpotential companies and generate the most compelling growth stories upon exit they are sourcing from a position of strength by targeting the most resilient sectors sharpening due diligence to gain the clearest downside perspectives and devising early robust strategies for margin improvement incremental revenue growth and exit planning they are reorganizing internally to devote more talent and resources to fixing companies—in many cases shoring up turnaround and margin improvement skills they are also adding depth to investment committee processes by including specialists and others in the portfolio review process while creating stringent guidelines to focus resources where they matter most we’ve devoted section  of this report to an examination of some of the key trends that will shape the asiapacific pe landscape in the coming year and beyond in section  we dig into how the most successful pe firms are investing in the talent resources and capabilities that will ensure they are ready to thrive amid today’s new normal more than ever that means sharpening execution at every phase of the game—finding value at entry adding value during hold and ensuring a growth story at exit the asiapacific pe market is still ripe with opportunity but the winners will be those that take nothing for granted  what happened in  despite the macroeconomic uncertainty that began roiling the equity markets by midyear  in the asiapacific pe industry was all about building on the momentum that began in —a year when deal value hit an alltime high exits broke out of a dispiriting threeyear slump and fundraising regained steam after two years in decline flush with both capital and confidence in  gps were eager to do deals and found ways to sustain a high level of activity throughout the year even as the broader outlook in china deteriorated here is how the year unfolded investments a year for the record books asiapacific pe deal value rose a stunning  in  to an alltime record of  billion—about twice the average of the previous five years much of that strength came from an unusual number of very large transactions but deal activity was robust throughout most of the region see figure  the number of individual transactions rose  above the fiveyear average to  breaking through the  mark for the first time average deal size also set a new record expanding to  million— higher than the fiveyear average greater china dominates for the second year in a row greater china china hong kong and taiwan led the charge in both value and deal count after surging  in  following a worrisome twoyear decline deal value in china grew another  last year to  billion accounting for about half the region’s total india and south korea also posted record deal flow while activity ebbed in southeast asia and japan see figure  sheer enthusiasm fueled much of the year’s momentum emboldened by a record number of exits which led to strong fundraising in  gps had ample capital to deploy and strong incentive to deploy it this was especially true in china where several years of robust fundraising and lower activity left gps with a mountain of dry powder overall the asiapacific market had  billion in unspent capital in  or about two years’ worth of investment see figure  opportunity also drew new players to the field after declining for two years the number of firms active in the region moved close to  a surge in publictoprivate deals deals larger than  billion in value dominated in markets such as china south korea and australia these megadeals accounted for  of total transaction value across the region almost double the value of a year earlier several factors came into play one was that us investors began to undervalue a number of chinese companies listed on us exchanges after accounting scandals tarred several of them that encouraged chinese owners to seek partners to take many of those companies private in a spate of massive transactions publictoprivate buyouts soared to  billion in value more than three times the fiveyear average and made up  of total pe deal value in  the trend spawned three of the top four deals in china—the  billion qihoo  deal the  billion buyout of wuxi pharmatech led by a consortium of pe funds and the  billion buyout of mobile social media company momo put together by the company’s ceo matrix partners sequoia and huatai ruilian fund management strong activity among large institutional investors and swfs also played a role in driving the large crop of megadeals these massive governmentsponsored investment vehicles have long shown keen interest in the asiapacific pe market and  was no exception swfs and institutional investors coinvested with traditional pe funds in  transactions representing  billion in value last year swfs alone were involved in  of the market’s  megadeals as we will discuss more thoroughly in section  direct investment by large institutional investors is an important trend that presents both opportunities and challenges for gps navigating an increasingly competitive asiapacific landscape but in our view these megainvestors tend to expand the market to include deals that most gps might not have access to or would be reluctant to do on their own internet fever the internet sector was by far the hottest area of focus as investors flocked to a narrow set of sectors that promise growth despite the general macroeconomic malaise see figure  as digital technology increasingly defines the daily routine in middleclass china and india companies offering internetbased solutions are exploding generating a tsunami of interest among pe funds looking for growth investors across the region piled a record  billion into  internetrelated deals in  and another  billion into  technology companies media healthcare and financial services also drew fresh interest in  but other than these five sectors most industries experienced a decline in deal count as investors focused on playing defense amid highly uncertain conditions high prices more control the searing competition for deals that has long characterized the asiapacific pe market showed no signs of letting up in  even as asset prices collapsed on the public markets the scramble to sign deals drove the average multiple of enterprise value in the asiapacific region to  times ebitda for pebacked transactions well above the average multiple of  in the us see figure  such inflated multiples will certainly dial up the pressure on gps to more actively manage their portfolio companies as they try to squeeze out more value in an uncertain growth environment the good news is that they have increasingly found ways to gain more control over their investments as we mentioned last year deals with pathtocontrol provisions are becoming ever more common in the asiapacific region as company owners get more comfortable with the pe value proposition in  a third of all deals in the region gave investors a stake of more than  where new investors remained a minority they were increasingly able to negotiate participation in the most critical decisions related to operating the company those provisions will be critical as gps work with company management teams to execute strategies that create more value exits down but still healthy after soaring to a record  billion in  it’s not surprising that exit value backed off in  perhaps more startling given the volatility in chinese equity markets is that exits were as strong as they were—especially in greater china where initial public offering ipo activity slumped badly in the year’s second half amid the equity market collapse see figure  total exit value across the asiapacific region hit  billion which was in line with the  billion fiveyear average and about even with  if you discount the  billion alibaba ipo that accounted for a major share of that year’s growth overall the market produced  individual exit transactions in  slightly more than the historical average strength in china and india greater china drove more than half the exit value in the region largely on the back of several massive ipos most of which were completed before the shanghai market fell apart in june india’s market for exits on the other hand benefited from a strong uplift in its public equity market and strong macro conditions throughout the year as the total number of exit transactions in india grew sharply exit value expanded to  billion more than twice the fiveyear average overall ipos accounted for  billion in total exit value and trade sales those with a strategic acquirer delivered another  billion secondary exits asset sales between pe firms remained a relatively small channel but grew slightly to  billion in  most gps expect secondary deals to expand as an exit channel since both sides of the transaction see benefits—for sellers a straight sale is more expeditious than an ipo and buyers get a company that another pe firm has already vetted portfolio cleanup although exit value was not as strong as in  the data contained clear positives the relatively robust exit activity two years in a row has helped gps keep their promises to lps by returning more capital it also helped gps scrub their portfolios of old deals by either swallowing or selling companies bought at high valuations before the  global financial crisis pre vintages now make up only  of unrealized value down from  two years ago looking at buyout deals by investment year the percentage of pre companies was  in june  about half the global average see figure  the amount of unrealized capital held in asiapacific–focused pe funds grew by  between june  and june  to reach the  billion mark for the first time an expansion in this exit overhang can be a sign that the industry isn’t recycling capital fast enough but in this case the increase was generated by the record level of new deals which is producing younger portfolios on average that and the industry’s efforts to clean out older deals actually trimmed the average holding period for asiapacific pe assets to  years from  years a year earlier see figure  hurdles ahead all of that is good news but there are still reasons for concern with heavy competition driving company valuations higher it will be increasingly difficult for gps to exit companies at the returns they were hoping for when they made the investments the ongoing volatility in the equity markets promises to make the ipo channel difficult—much as it was in china during the second half of last year and as economic growth slows it will put downward pressure on company earnings making it harder to position portfolio companies for strong exit multiples the industry’s challenge amid such conditions will be to keep the exit overhang from growing as older investments begin to pile up again for gps under pressure to keep the investment flywheel turning the message is clear as competition for deals drives up average multiples it will be critical to stay disciplined when making acquisitions and focus on exit strategies from day one returns sustained momentum—for now when it comes to returns the challenge for gps in the years ahead will be to keep up the hardwon positive momentum of the past two years as we’ve mentioned  was the first year in the industry’s history that lps were cash positive meaning aggregate distributions of capital were higher than capital calls if you were to include real estate and infrastructure funds the turning point would actually have come in  the most recent available numbers indicate that the trend continued last year through the first half of  lps got about  back for each  called see figure  continued strength critically these distributions come with improving returns—especially among the topquartile funds that attract the most investor attention median returns for asiapacific–focused funds pushed toward a  net internal rate of return irr based on the latest data available mostly june or september  that’s a  percentage point improvement from returns logged in december  topquartile funds meanwhile posted an average of  well above the  net irr most lps say they demand from their emerging asia exposure while it is hard to accurately assess fund returns in the early years of an investment we are heartened by the fact that younger asiapacific funds—those in the – vintages—are currently expected to generate returns of more than  that is well above expectations for similar vintages in the us and europe speed bumps ahead all that said it is very likely that returns will come under pressure in  and beyond since the projected irrs for those younger vintages are essentially paper returns they can change direction very rapidly pe fund returns typically take about seven years to stabilize and a lot could happen between now and when investors actually see their money slowing gdp growth chronically high price multiples and interest rates that have nowhere to go but up will only make it harder to produce the irrs that investors demand of their emerging market exposure and if the market’s record pile of unrealized capital continues to grow it will become more and more difficult to make timely distributions producing marketbeating returns in other words will require gps to squeeze more out of their portfolios with strategies to counteract the market’s headwinds more on that in sections  and  fundraising winner take all this clear call to action is most apparent in the industry’s fundraising dynamics over the past several years although the market remained extremely crowded with approximately  of the market’s  active funds on the road looking for funds over the course of  capital raised from lps declined  to  billion on par with the historical average that compares with a  decline globally to  billion see figure  parsed another way there were  times more asiapacific–focused firms on the road in  than those that actually closed their funds they were seeking  billion at the end of  and attracted about twothirds of that the flight to quality continues part of the sluggishness was that limited partners are definitely looking to deploy capital elsewhere as they wait for more clarity in the asiapacific region a recent preqin fund manager survey identified asia as the region most shaken in global investor confidence nearly a fifth of global fund managers surveyed planned to decrease their investment in the turbulent region it would be a mistake however to conclude that the softness in fundraising last year was an indication that lps have soured on the asiapacific market in any permanent way a closer look at the numbers suggests two other factors at work first gps focused on the region are already flush with unspent capital meaning many were simply more intent on putting money to work in  than on raising more second—and this is where the call to action comes in—lps are becoming increasingly more selective when choosing funds with which to invest lps have learned their lesson in the asiapacific markets having been badly disappointed by the region’s performance during the last boom cycle longer track records mean they also have better visibility into which funds can be trusted to produce sustained marketbeating performances the resulting flight to quality is funneling the distribution of fresh capital toward the very best firms—those that have proven they can perform in an increasingly difficult environment top performers are doing fine this dynamic can be seen through several lenses for instance the minority of asiapacific funds that managed to close last year raised an average of  more than they targeted vs a fiveyear average of negative  they also took less time to close— months on average vs  months in  even among this group lps showed a clear preference for the largest most experienced funds these gps which raised more than  billion took only  months to close and twothirds of them met their targets by comparison only  of smaller funds with less experience met their targets and just  of firsttime funds did see figure   turning to the family office further complicating the fundraising dynamic is that the composition of the asiapacific region’s pe investor base is changing in many cases new regulations are restricting the amount of capital that traditional sources such as pension funds can invest in private equity at the same time lps are cooling on the fund of funds channel slowing down another stream of capital data shows that gps are increasingly turning to family offices and highnetworth individuals who have a strong appetite for private equity and large allocations available to invest in alternative asset classes sovereign funds and government agencies meanwhile continue to be a key source of capital in the region these large sophisticated investors are especially partial to gps with a clearly differentiated strategy and a record of strong performance as economic conditions get increasingly challenging it stands to reason that they will only become more selective  searching for opportunity amid a new normal private equity investing in the asiapacific region has always centered on growth powered by legions of rising middleclass consumers this diverse collection of vibrant emerging economies has historically grown at a significantly faster pace than the rest of the world the great preponderance of pe deals in the region have relied on growth strategies aimed mostly at increasing a company’s topline—creating value by riding an industry tailwind for instance or expanding geographically and adding new markets even in the wake of the global economic crisis in  the asiapacific growth story endured since then lps have allocated  billion of fresh capital to funds that are fully dedicated to the region the number climbs to  trillion when you include funds with some asiapacific focus so has the sudden and sharp deceleration of china’s gdp growth over the past year called that growth story into question to some degree we think this widespread concern is overblown taken together the asiapacific economies still offer real gdp growth in the  range well above the global average most economists believe that india alone will continue to expand at  annually with markets as diverse as japan and myanmar economic and investment prospects vary widely but the asiapacific region is hardly fading as an attractive place to put the private equity value proposition to work on the contrary we believe that the region will continue to offer ample opportunity to earn strong returns at an acceptable level of risk to investors looking for emerging market exposure what is changing however is the shape of those opportunities china remains the region’s center of gravity and by far the biggest market for private equity we believe that the profound shifts taking place there are ushering in a new normal in which asiapacific pe investors can no longer rely upon uninterrupted growth at the same time asset prices throughout the region remain stubbornly high as record amounts of dry powder pressure gps to do deals amid stiff competition from cashrich corporations seeking to buy growth to meet shareholder expectations steep multiples may make it difficult to produce adequate returns given the clouds ahead this blend of deep economic uncertainty and fierce competition means that gps will have to work harder across every link in the pe value chain to find attractive companies increase their value and sell them at a premium in this section we’ll explore the market contours of the region’s new normal and discuss in more detail how gps are trying to position themselves to win as last year’s recordbreaking deal activity demonstrated the pe industry can be extremely resourceful when it comes to putting money to work in a difficult environment the question is this what do gps and their investors have to do differently now that the steady tailwind of economic growth can no longer be taken for granted the situation in china nowhere is this question more pressing than in china where the massive selloff on the shanghai market reflects deep anxiety about the government’s ability to manage its transition from exportled hypergrowth to a more sustainable model fueled by consumption most economists agree that china’s real gdp growth rate is on a steady slope downward from about  in  to  or  by the end of the decade see figure  the economy is also littered with potential landmines decades of overinvestment have left rampant overcapacity and some analysts estimate that china’s poorly regulated banking system is sitting on as much as  trillion in bad debt— the simmering residue of the nation’s unchecked lending to fuel growth riding a rocky transition the threat of a financial meltdown has limited the government’s ability to institute reforms that would increase consumer spending and speed the transition to future sources of growth instead beijing is faced with the growing challenge of cleaning up the financial system without pitching the economy into recession given that china buys more than  trillion of goods and services globally each year the spillover effects from its slowdown will likely be felt around the world with pressure on global trade commodity prices currencies and lending against this backdrop ’s recordbreaking  billion in pe deal value was truly remarkable the total which was  higher than the previous peak owed much to a strong crop of  billionplus megadeals— of them vs  in  but the individual deal count also rose sharply to  or  higher than the previous fiveyear average this surge in activity was a tribute to both the motivating power of the market’s massive pile of dry powder and the industry’s ability take full advantage of what the turbulent market had to offer as clouds gathered over traditional industries such as manufacturing and retail for instance investors poured into the redhot internet sector which showed no signs of stalling faced with rising multiples that made traditional pe deals too expensive gps pivoted to chinese companies that were undervalued on us exchanges leading to a number of massive publictoprivate deals as we’ll explore later in this section the best gps were also able to work closely with large cohorts of gps and lps to coinvest in a number of deals that would have been too large to handle alone a test for pe as china’s economy continues to sink into uncertainty it will test the industry’s resilience and creativity few doubt that returns will come under pressure as gps confront challenges from all directions anemic growth in many sectors means that the average company’s profits are likely to weaken substantially that and sinking public equity values may ease pressure on price multiples in some sectors but they will also cloud visibility into the future making it difficult to assess and create real value hot sectors such as the internet meanwhile are hypercompetitive meaning multiples are soaring through the roof that presents a growing bubble risk and makes it difficult to buy with discipline all of this will challenge gps’ ability to put massive amounts of dry powder to work profitably and the exit environment won’t be any easier despite two years of strong exit activity in china the backlog of unrealized value is likely to rise in the years ahead given increasing pressure on portfolio company earnings a weakening ipo channel and the likelihood that potential corporate buyers will turn inward to focus on defending their core operations or invest elsewhere capital outflow one final note regarding china’s impact on the global pe market as we’ve already mentioned china’s economy is so large and so central to the global economic fabric that its slowdown will surely be felt around the world but there are two other impacts that will affect pe investors first as lps wait for clarity in china they will likely direct capital allocations elsewhere second outbound ma is soaring in china as large domestic companies look aggressively for diversification and market entry elsewhere around the world both of these factors are creating an investment capital outflow that is already increasing competition for deals in more stable and attractive pe markets in the asiapacific region activity in india or southeast asia may benefit from this capital reallocation but gps there can also expect competition for deals from cashrich chinese corporate buyers eyeing opportunities in their markets asset class and geographic diversification gain steam as volatility and competition mount across the region we are seeing an increasing number of gps seeking to diversify their risk by expanding the scope of their investments see figure  a trend toward geographic expansion has been building for several years as firms try to limit their exposure to any single asiapacific market increasingly they are also taking steps to add new asset classes—setting up hedge funds for instance or investing in nontraditional areas such as debt instruments real estate and infrastructure as appealing as diversification might seem in an increasingly challenging environment however it can also pose a high degree of risk asset class expansion in particular typically offers few operational synergies and can dilute focus at a time when staying on point is critical increasing appetite about a third of the gps in our survey said they invest in nontraditional asset classes and  of them indicated they would be broadening their scope to include such investments over the next five years one prime example emerged in january  when kkr said it had formed a partnership with china orient asset management and coscapital to focus on credit and distressed debt opportunities in china with a key focus on the real estate sector around  of respondents meanwhile said that they plan to increase their geographic scope over the next five years indonesia’s northstar for instance has broadened its area of activity to cover other countries in southeast asia while vogo in south korea recently recast itself as a panasia fund many gps are also doing crossborder deals defined as investments placed in geographies where the firm has no ontheground presence a good example is tpg’s india team which led a  million investment in sri lanka’s asiri hospital china’s gsr ventures recently raised a  billion fund to invest globally in companies focused on accessing china’s market size and experience matter aside from straight portfolio diversification there are many reasons why firms choose to widen their scope the move may be opportunistic—a way to tap an area of high growth or capture shortterm returns it may be a way to leverage a marquee brand name in fundraising or to meet customer needs many believe that lucrative synergies can be found between old and new areas of focus sometimes there is also an organizational rationale—namely diversification provides opportunities for teams to branch out beyond buyouts and growth deals in our experience however these decisions to steer significant capital and resources away from a firm’s core strategy should be made very carefully a few large global firms such as blackstone have made it look easy by using diversification to build scale and spur growth but few pe firms have the talent and expertise to expand into unfamiliar territory successfully most gps especially those already pressed to source deals and engineer exits in their core business are better served to focus on executing closer to the firm’s sweet spot and creating differentiation rooted in existing capabilities branching out wisely between the two geographic expansion is probably less risky the synergies are clearer when a firm invests in a market outside its geographic scope since it can take advantage of existing capabilities and sector expertise done well it is basically an adjacency play that takes advantage of a firm’s core strength and repeatable model to tap new geographies and limit market concentration but simply parachuting a team into another country rarely achieves the desired result successfully expanding beyond a sweet spot requires a clear evaluation of the opportunity and a robust strategy to compete and differentiate in the new market there are many models for entering new geographies but some are better than others in our experience the best approach relies on a mix of organic and inorganic expansion blending the firm’s expertise with the right local hires to fill in the critical local knowledge and networks carlyle for instance has gone to great lengths to build local contacts since it began expanding its footprint in the region in the late s central to its strategy has been a board of prominent asian officials and business people assembled by former us president and carlyle adviser george hw bush this group helps open doors and find investments but each carlyle office also needs a wellrounded team of professionals on the ground to put capital to work profitably coinvesting with limited partners large wellconnected gps are also finding opportunities to invest in some of the biggest deals by teaming up with swfs and other large institutions that are increasingly seeking novel ways to partner with their favorite gps on better terms often this means coinvesting with one or a select group of gps see figure  but it can also mean setting up a separate account—that is an agreement under which a gp invests a pool of capital for a single lp under special terms select lps are also building internal teams to invest directly in transactions sourced by them or partner gps but this remains limited to the few large institutions that have enough muscle to take on direct investment shadow capital commonly referred to as shadow capital these forms of lp investment proliferate in the asiapacific region and spawned some of ’s biggest deals out of the   billionplus transactions in the region last year  were either coinvestments involving lps or deals that included direct lp investments coinvestments alone accounted for  billion in deal value vs an average of  billion annually over the previous five years separate accounts which are gaining in popularity globally have yet to become as big a factor in the asiapacific region but momentum is building gps have raised more than  billion in separate accounts over the past two years one example the reserve bank of india last year placed  million with sidbi venture capital to form the reserve bank startup fund lps have gravitated toward more direct investment for several reasons the most obvious is that direct investment can produce better returns since lps tend to enjoy better fee structures in coinvestments and structured accounts these arrangements give lps more control over outcomes premium access to the best gps and the chance to enhance their internal investment management capabilities but they also generate controversy because shadow capital isn’t counted in fundraising totals it is hard for other investors to know exactly what influence a side arrangement with an unnamed large investor may be having on a gp’s behavior some observers also see lps looming as competition in a crowded market for attractive deals more opportunity than threat in our survey only  of respondents viewed large institutions or swfs as a threat most recognize that shadow capital tends to expand the pie not claim an undue share of it in practice the presence of large wellconnected investors in the market allows an elite group of gps to take on bigger deals than they would otherwise be able to do and because swfs have unique relationships with government entities they also get access to deals in the asiapacific region that would never be available to others for many gps coinvestments and separate accounts burnish relationships with important deeppocketed investors that can be a welcome sweetener in a tough asiapacific fundraising market one thing that’s clear about shadow capital is that it’s not going away swfs have long been major players on the asiapacific pe scene and other large institutions see strong reasons to keep allocating a portion of their capital to a more direct form of pe investment among the gps in our survey  said that they expect coinvestments to increase in  for most of them the spread of shadow capital is less a threat than an opportunity to participate in some of the region’s biggest most important transactions the need to exert control as appealing as diversification or coinvestment may be the key to thriving amid slower growth and turbulence for most pe firms will be shoring up their core value proposition as we’ve said the region’s rising tide of steady economic growth in years past tended to lift all boats and propel even average companies to higher valuations as growth ebbs however it will become proportionally harder to create value without making significant changes to a portfolio company’s operations management team and strategy the power to exert such influence has often been missing in the asiapacific region—especially in the minority deal situations that have tended to dominate the region’s pe investing activity but that is changing as gps increasingly gravitate toward transactions that offer significantly more control over investment outcomes a shift to buyouts to some degree this is a natural outgrowth of the asiapacific pe industry’s maturation company sellers once wary of giving up too much equity have warmed up to the pe value proposition gps say that owners appreciate the expertise and capabilities that gps can offer and are more often willing to give investors bigger stakes board seats and decision rights that firms can use to exert real influence over value creation the trend toward more control produced a surge in buyout deals in  and that’s likely to continue see figure  value in these transactions which feature a majority stake jumped to  billion dwarfing the  billion average over the previous five years according to bain’s  survey  of gps said that they expect buyouts will make up more than  of their portfolios over the next two or three years vs  for growth deals they also expressed their intent to negotiate pathtocontrol provisions even when they do sign growth deals with minority stakes at the moment  of portfolio companies bought with minority stakes are protected by such provisions but gps expect that proportion to grow to more than  in the next two to three years execution is critical as necessary as such control mechanisms are when it comes to generating better returns they aren’t sufficient it’s also critical that gps make the most of the opportunity to directly improve a company’s performance—something many gps worry they don’t do well enough see figure  although  of the gps in our survey said they put in place robust value creation plans for  of their portfolio companies within six months of an acquisition only  said they believe that they are executing successfully on those plans the median fund has two to three fulltime people per geography devoted to value creation and plans to add at least two more by the end of the decade but it’s not clear whether this increased investment is paying off in better results we’ve devoted section  to examining this issue in more depth but we believe that the answer lies in how pe firms approach portfolio activism rather than simply shifting people into valuecreation roles gps need to ask themselves whether those people have the right skills and experience to derive real value in a market that is becoming decidedly more challenging as we’ve noted with so many companies selling for skyhigh multiples and exit channels becoming significantly less friendly returns are likely to come under pressure in the asiapacific region five years ago almost  of the gps we surveyed said that improving topline organic growth was their main source of value creation in today’s environment more than half say they will rely on ma and improved capital efficiency as the two main sources of value creation over the next five years consequently it will become increasingly important to bring in new talent with expertise in change management transformation and margin improvement sector opportunities amid macro changes overall macro volatility will certainly affect the short and mediumterm investment outlook for the entire asiapacific region it has already cast a pall over many of the traditional industries and consumer markets that investors have favored in recent decades but longer term the world’s center of gravity is clearly shifting back toward the asiapacific region laying a firm foundation for future growth by  the region will be home to a staggering  billion people—four times as many as in north america and europe combined their lives will be fundamentally different than they are now with important demographic shifts ushering in new spending patterns and behaviors these markets are becoming older wealthier and technically more sophisticated the region is learning to produce more for domestic consumption and exports increasingly consist of highervalue goods over time this combination promises to rekindle substantial growth and forwardlooking pe investors are already staking out claims in those sectors likely to benefit the list that follows is hardly exhaustive but it does give a sense of where investors are looking next as the asiapacific region matures see figure  the digital future as we’ve mentioned internetrelated investments dominated deal count and value in  as investors flocked to the one sector that seemed immune to economic pressure the resulting spike in deal multiples should raise red flags for any investor hoping to join the party in  but there is also good reason to believe that digital technology will continue to reshape people’s lives globally and create ongoing opportunities for investors the digital transformation of the consumer experience that many take for granted in developed markets is still gaining steam in many asiapacific economies not only is it creating sweeping change in many consumer and bb industries but innovations such as cloud services and nearzerocost connectivity are enabling companies with limited resources to harness capabilities that can match or beat those of much larger rivals accelerating penetration of many categories that has led to large investments in a variety of sectors and geographies for example coatue management tiger global management softbank and others pooled  million to invest in grabtaxi a taxi booking app developer in southeast asia in china silver lake asia led a consortium that invested  million in qunarcom which aggregates searches from more than  chinese language travel sites to provide realtime pricing for more than  airlines and  hotels serving the mainland market the asian consumer  for decades investors have viewed the asiapacific consumer market through two very different lenses one has focused on the ultrawealthy upper classes with their endless appetite for luxury foreign imports the other has been trained on the emerging consumers at the lowest rung of the middle class who need basic items such as soap packaged goods and cheap consumer electronics as the gap closes between these two groups however the asiapacific region is producing a new breed of more sophisticated middleclass consumers with life concerns that will sound familiar to families in developed markets they need better healthcare safer more nutritious food highquality educational services and reliable financial services viewed through this lens a variety of sectors produced fresh opportunities in  bain capital for example invested  million to acquire ooedoonsenmonogatari the japanbased spa hotel company to tap into the region’s growing appetite for healthy spa resorts a consortium of goldstone investment hony capital saic capital and shanghai pudong science and technology invested  billion in shanghai bright dairy  food which has targeted consumers looking for a vendor of healthy dairy products other large investments included a  million deal for india’s sun pharmaceutical industries and a  million investment in bodyfriend a korean manufacturer of massage chairs and related equipment these companies aren’t focused on either the very rich or the lower middle class they exist to serve the more complex and nuanced requirements of an increasingly wealthy and educated domestic asian consumer advanced manufacturing led by china and india the bold vision of most advanced asiapacific economies is to graduate beyond the region’s legacy of lowcost manufacturing and metoo product offerings to create modern hightech industrial sectors to rival those in developed markets perhaps the most comprehensive expression of this ambition is the “made in china ” initiative introduced by chinese officials last year china’s tax and investment policy has long focused on incentivizing industry to use innovation to climb up the value chain to compete in more technologically advanced industries made in china  focuses on helping companies become world class across the entire production process in  key sectors advanced information technology automated machine tools and robotics aerospace and aeronautical equipment hightech shipping modern rail systems newenergy vehicles power equipment agricultural equipment new materials and biopharmaadvanced medical equipment the chinese government is also stepping up support for these sectors a governmentsponsored vehicle called the shanghai integrated circuit investment fund for instance has announced plans to invest about  billion in three shanghaibased chipmakers with a quarter going to semiconductor manufacturing international corporation china’s largest and most advanced semiconductor foundry looking more broadly at the asiapacific region many pe funds have bet on the increased demand for green energy a good example is the consortium of adia goldman sachs and global environment fund which invested about  million in renew power over the past few years including  million in  hoping to participate in the growing demand for renewable energy in india profiting from volatility as with any period of cyclical weakness and volatility the current environment is presenting opportunities for sophisticated contrarians the gloomy global growth outlook sinking oil and commodity prices erratic currencies and potential upward movement on interest rates are all attracting the attention of valuehungry investors hony capital for instance last november invested  million in santos a major australian oil and gas company emr capital and farallon capital anted up  million to acquire pt agincourt resources the indonesia gold and silver mining group the eroding credit environment is presenting opportunities for distressed investmentspecial situation specialists kkr for one has overweighted its portfolios toward distressed investments partly because it believes that china’s structural investment slowdown is creating distressed opportunities in that country’s overleveraged corporate sector kkr also sees a knockon effect among china’s trading partners in emerging markets especially india and indonesia there’s no doubt that investors with a clear understanding of a specific market can do well playing cycles amid heavy volatility but it remains a highly risky strategy in most cases making it work usually requires bringing to bear other mechanisms to create value by improving performance and assessing risk success requires exquisite timing both at purchase and at exit infographic private equity in asiapacific  thriving in turbulence and uncertainty one of the primary reasons private equity has such enduring appeal among large sophisticated investors is that it tends to outperform other asset classes especially in times of turbulence in the asiapacific region for instance investment advisory firm cambridge associates found that buyout funds outperformed public markets by five to seven percentage points over both oneyear and fiveyearplus time horizons even funds closed during the global financial crisis have fared well the median irr of the asiapacific funds from the  to  vintages initially sank to a negative  by december  but with the fullness of time those paper losses turned into gains and grew to around  by june  that’s lower than the  median irr across all vintages as of the same date but still robust given the magnitude of the downturn see figure  the pe advantage the pe value proposition is well tuned for hard times because it allows gps to actively manage assets as conditions change firms can tap internal capabilities or hire new talent to transform portfolio companies in a variety of ways from reshaping operations to restructuring balance sheets it’s also an advantage that capital is stable and the investment horizon is extensible at least to a degree in times of crisis or turbulence that can often allow enough time before exit to produce meaningful changes to the business and adapt to a new competitive or economic context if necessary why review all of this because at a time when soaring deal multiples and slowing growth threaten to disrupt exits and returns it provides important context around what gps should be doing to prepare the best pe firms manage their way through volatility by sourcing well understanding risk adding value during holding periods and setting themselves up to exit opportunistically but they also have to be able to pivot when conditions change carlyle group provided a textbook example of doing this well in  when it spent  million on a  stake in china’s yangzhou chengde steel tube company the carlyle team believed that yangzhou could become a strong global player given its low cost structure competitive product quality and short production lead time but when the financial crisis hit with full force a few months later the game plan changed carlyle weathered the storm by aggressively managing working capital and curtailing spending to preserve cash it also replaced management improved governance and invested heavily to triple capacity modernize production and shift to highermargin products by  when the economy began to recover carlyle had built a solid exit story allowing it to sell its stake to precision castparts a usbased strategic buyer for three times its original investment coping with uncertainty there’s no way of knowing how long the fog of uncertainty will hang over the asiapacific region or how it will ultimately affect market conditions but for all the reasons we’ve outlined above it is highly likely that returns will be challenged as exit channels come under pressure and gps hold companies longer it would be easy to look back over the past two years of robust deal and exit activity and assume that what worked in the past will work in the future but we find the most successful gps are never that complacent changing conditions prompt them to recalibrate their repeatable models® for a new set of competitive and market assumptions in the current environment they are focusing on three key areas see figure  creating a stormproof portfolio as macro and industry conditions change so do the assumptions underpinning most deal theses it becomes critical to size up each company in a portfolio by asking two things does the original investment thesis still hold water and if not what must be done to maximize value in a new more difficult environment this is essentially a repeat of the due diligence process through the lens of economic disruption it involves reevaluating the risks emerging from the new macro environment gaining a fresh understanding of the company’s sensitivities to those risks and realigning the valuecreation plan to thrive in this new normal the next step is to prioritize where the firm will spend its limited resources it’s often tempting for pe firms to overinvest in losing deals as they try to steer the company back on track but thriving in turbulence requires firms to adhere to a simple principle double down on the winners and minimize your losses where a company ranks along this spectrum is a function of how much equity is at risk and how much investment is required to drive an adequate level of value in our experience firms need to adopt a disciplined systematic approach to drawing these priorities if they want to avoid the impulse to throw good money after bad that said the strength of private equity is that it is patient capital firms too often trip up by overreacting to shortterm volatility and lose faith in the fundamentals that attracted them to the company in the first place once it becomes clear which companies should get the most attention it is time to go to work to bring those fundamentals to full potential if conditions have deteriorated rapidly these companies might need a shortterm strategy to help them ride out the storm—raising cash through balance sheet adjustments or selective cost cutting for instance combined with plans to enhance revenue right away this will give the firm and management time to thoughtfully adjust the longerterm valuecreation plan refocusing management attention by tying incentives to executing on the top three to five initiatives that will truly make a difference the gps that find the most opportune exits amid difficult conditions typically aren’t the beneficiaries of good timing or fortune they have been preparing the company for exit almost from day one so that they can seize the best opportunity when it arrives they identify potential buyers early decide on the most likely timetable for exit and tailor their valuecreation plan accordingly in effect they put themselves in a potential buyer’s shoes and ask what set of valuecreation strategies will build the most compelling exit story then when the exit horizon draws near the firm is ready to optimize inyear ebitda and cash flow to present buyers with the most attractive asset possible sourcing from a position of strength with huge piles of unspent capital waiting to be put to work gps in the asiapacific region are under heavy pressure to find deals and close them but as rising asset prices collide with slowing economic growth it is especially critical to approach the market with discipline we find that the most effective gps have internalized a set of capabilities that allow them to walk the line between taking appropriate risks and paying too much for assets as macro conditions become more challenging successful gps become more focused on their sweet spot and concentrate on the fundamentals they understand and believe in most that gives them the confidence to go deep on fewer companies and build a thesis that allows them to outbid others from a position of greater knowledge and insight they assess opportunities for what they really are not what either wishful thinking or excessive pessimism make them appear to be macro uncertainty also means that gps need to push harder on downside scenarios to develop a clear understanding of what would happen to a company’s value if the worst were to occur very often this requires an honest reassessment of existing capabilities how well for instance does the firm really understand the interplay of macroeconomic and microeconomic factors that affect its portfolios few anticipated the black swan plunge in oil prices over the past year but the gps that have avoided the most pain are those that understood in advance how such an event would affect their companies and were prepared to pull the right levers when the moment came to act most often however finding the right opportunities as economic growth slows means reorienting the firm’s thinking around what will create value in the new environment as we’ve noted many portfolios in the asiapacific region have benefited historically from strong tailwinds that propelled organic revenue growth without that macro support premium value will more often come from performance improvement that might mean ferreting out ways to zerobudget aspects of production or the supply chain to find efficiencies that boost margins it could involve expanding the topline via ma or adding capabilities to take advantage of an untapped market adjacency cost reduction is rarely enough to produce a winner on its own but combining margin improvement with revenue expansion can be a powerful way to counteract economic malaise as we pointed out in section  it can also make a big difference to scout deals in key sectors where growth is likely to hold up even as macro conditions deteriorate our view is that gps need to be disciplined in such situations—it can be perilous to drift too far from the firm’s sweet spot in pursuit of seemingly attractive sectors but firms with a clear understanding of industry dynamics and a strong deal thesis can find value and growth amid even the worst conditions a good example is sequoia capital’s  million investment in india’s prizm payment services with  million committed in  prizm deploys and operates pointofsale and atmbased payment systems for banks and financial services companies convinced that there was a gap between the demand and supply of atms and sensing the potential to substantially increase the company’s footprint sequoia’s team decided to back prizm which was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the growing use of debit and credit cards in india amid a global financial crisis sequoia provided capital and expertise to help make it happen and focused early on crafting a clear exit strategy when japan’s hitachi came looking for an entry to india’s burgeoning financial services market in  it latched onto prizm offering a multiple of five times sequoia’s initial investment building a battleready organization what we’ve been talking about in the previous two sections is portfolio activism—the need for pe firms to create their own tailwind instead of relying on economic expansion to propel returns most of the gps we surveyed recognize the growing importance of adding heft in this area today  of the gps in our survey use an internal team to manage postacquisition value creation for almost all their companies and more than half said they would do so over the next three to five years moreover  employ external help for more than half their companies and that number should grow to  in the coming years as we noted however strong execution is another matter only a small minority of firms believe that they execute as planned on value creation most often in other words the resources put in place to boost value aren’t doing the job there is no right model for improving the firm’s ability to execute more consistently but all successful efforts begin with attracting retaining and nurturing top talent to drive the effort forward that requires doubling down on efforts to identify elevate and retain star talent both within the firm and at portfolio companies but it also means assessing what skills will be needed to thrive in the new normal and building those capabilities either internally or by tapping specialized external resources transforming companies to thrive in a more difficult environment for instance may require procurement specialists to rework the sourcing strategy or experts in salesforce effectiveness who can put in systems to boost the topline cvc capital partners has addressed this issue by creating an operations team to work with existing deal and capital markets teams to set up a structured valuecreation approach within its portfolio companies other firms have achieved a similar result by using a mix of inside and outside resources in our experience pe funds also have to look at how they make decisions starting with the investment committee ic too often the firm lacks a full understanding of how macro and competitive dynamics will affect portfolio companies they need to assess whether they have the proper processes in place to bring the people with key knowledge and insights into decisions they should ask whether the committee is meeting often enough and using the right data to assess performance once investments are made the ic needs stringent guidelines to ensure that the firm is allocating resources to the portfolio companies with the highest potential to produce marketbeating returns the best gps take a forensic approach to their past investments to diagnose what led to success and what produced failure they can then build decision tools based on those factors to force deal teams to assess how prospective acquisitions stack up they also use this knowledge to create proprietary performance metrics to help track portfolio companies and provide early warning signs before an investment veers too far off course the result is that the firm can take a proactive approach to value creation confident that deal teams have a solid handle on the risks and opportunities ahead the objective is to dial up the firm’s intelligence and market radar to ensure more consistent marketbeating results  are your valuecreation capabilities tuned for a new normal a year ago in this space we made the observation that the most successful pe firms around the world share a key trait they quickly transition from thinking as acquirers to acting as value creators as asiapacific growth slows this has never been a more essential attribute in fact we would argue that the best acquirers in many ways are value creators the clarity of their insights the quality of their due diligence and the discipline with which they price assets all represent the initial steps in mobilizing the right valuecreation strategy and executing on it as we did last year we’d like to end this report with a set of questions designed to help firms that are preparing for a more challenging future assess where they stand in terms of valuecreation capabilities these questions will also help firms consider how they might adjust their priorities to build more sustainable performance have you stormproofed your portfolio do you understand how the new normal will affect your current holdings is there consensus among your deal and operating partners about which portfolio companies have the potential to go from good to great does your firm back those companies with sufficient resources to help them become big winners are company management and operating partners aligned on the short list of priority initiatives that will really move the needle on equity value creation do you have clear exit plans in place to help maximize your returns are you sourcing from a position of strength do you relentlessly focus on your sweet spot and outbid only on companies with fundamentals that you understand and believe in do you have a clear understanding of how the sectors you invest in will hold up during a downturn and how those risks will affect your companies does your due diligence produce clarity on opportunities for incremental growth margin improvement and downside risks are you building a battleready organization has your firm developed the internal capabilities or a network of specialists that it can call on to help produce margin improvement or turnaround initiatives at portfolio companies does your investment committee have processes in place to drive more informed consistent decision making does your firm have stringent guidelines about how to prioritize time and resources have you sharpened your hr systems to ensure that you are nurturing your key people and attracting the best talent from outside the firm as we’ve stressed throughout this report there’s little doubt that the asiapacific private equity industry will be challenged to repeat ’s performance in the coming years yet we’re more than confident that the best firms will adapt and thrive amid slower growth and fierce competition over the past several years pe has proven its value to both company owners in the region and global investors looking for a potent source of superior investment returns but make no mistake—the market will continue to reward only those firms that can adjust to the asiapacific region’s new normal to produce consistent marketbeating performance market definition the asiapacific private equity market as defined for this report
