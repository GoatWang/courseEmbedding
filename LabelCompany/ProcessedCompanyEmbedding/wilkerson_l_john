her first piece  an s cherry end table  when she was  but he proved a fast learner succumbing quickly to the easy charm optimism and diversity of folk art they began collecting after they were married  years ago and furnished their first home on a tight budget with painted chests tables and a desk paying less than  for most pieces by the s they were buying decorative objects and weathervanesthe first vane they bought was by j howard  co of west bridgewater mass we knew he was our guy his vanes were the most striking mr wilkerson said in the s we decided that we would develop the most comprehensive collection of weathervanes by howard weve probably done just that  nobody else would be so crazyof the  vanes they own  are by howard a competitor in the s of the betterknown manufacturers a l jewell of waltham mass and j w fiske of new york howard specialized in using zinc and copper to achieve a better balance in his vanes and he made stepping horses of exceptional grace while jewell strove for more dynamic movement in his allcopper horses this characteristic is seen in a wilkerson treasure a patinated flying horse by jewell its tail and mane borne high by the windthe wilkersons also realize that their involvement in the museum is having an impact on their collecting they are trying to upgrade what they buy and to better document the pieces that they own but their biggest problem as collectors they say is that they have never sold or given away anything from their collection we cant seem to say goodbye mr wilkerson said we have a lot to learn from the curators
