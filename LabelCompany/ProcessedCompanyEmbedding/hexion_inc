secured notes collectively the “secured indentures” contain an adjusted ebitda to fixed charges ratio incurrence test which may restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt or making acquisitions if the company is unable to meet this ratio measured on a last twelve months or ltm basis of at least  the adjusted ebitda to fixed charges ratio under the secured indentures is generally defined as the ratio of a adjusted ebitda to b net interest expense excluding the amortization or writeoff of deferred financing costs each measured on a ltm basis see “nonus gaap measures” for further information regarding adjusted ebitda and schedule  to the release for a calculation of the adjusted ebitda to fixed charges ratio the company’s abl facility does not have any financial maintenance covenant other than a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  to  that would only apply if the company’s availability under the abl facility at any time is less than the greater of a  million and b  of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total abl facility commitments at such time the fixed charge coverage ratio under the credit agreement governing the abl facility is generally defined as the ratio of a adjusted ebitda minus nonfinanced capital expenditures and cash taxes to b debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain restricted payments each measured on an ltm basis at march   the company’s availability under the abl facility exceeded such levels therefore the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio did not apply nonus gaap measures segment ebitda is defined as ebitda adjusted to exclude certain noncash and nonrecurring expenses segment ebitda is an important measure used by the companys senior management and board of directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments corporate and other primarily represents certain corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments segment ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net loss or other results reported in accordance with us gaap segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies see schedule  to this release for reconciliation of net loss to segment ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda adjusted for certain noncash and certain nonrecurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro forma basis including the expected future cost savings from business optimization programs or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument as the company is highly leveraged it believes that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate adjusted ebitda provides additional information to investors about the company’s ability to comply with its financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future adjusted ebitda and fixed charges are not defined terms under us gaap adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial condition liquidity or profitability and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss determined in accordance with us gaap or operating cash flows determined in accordance with us gaap additionally ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our indebtedness depreciation and amortization expense because the company uses capital assets depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue working capital needs tax payments because the payment of taxes is part of our operations it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate nonrecurring expenses and capital expenditures fixed charges under the secured indentures should not be considered an alternative to interest expense see

composites march    am eastern daylight time columbus ohiobusiness wirehexion inc “hexion” or the “company” will introduce a new specialty epoxy resin system for styrenefree sheet molding compound smc manufacturing of highperformance automotive composites at the jec world  composites event in paris the new offering  epikotetm resin trac epikuretm curing agent trac   can be used to produce lightweight semistructural and structural automotive composite parts such as floors electrical vehicle battery enclosures spare wheel tubs seat structures hood inners and more hexion’s smc epoxy system when combined with glass and carbon fibers results in parts with superior mechanical properties to those made with standard unsaturated polyester up or vinyl ester ve smc resin systems hexion’s epoxy smc system also emits fewer volatile organic compounds vocs according to vda  than either standard or low voc vinyl esters with emissions well below international exposure limits the vda  recommendation governs organic emissions for molded compounds in automobiles because hexion’s epoxy smc system is styrenefree there is no need to track worker styrene exposure to comply with european workplace standard the new epoxy system’s compatibility with equipment used for other types of smc up and ve means additional capital investment is often unnecessary this new specialty epoxy product line will help our customers manufacture high performance composite parts via highvolume smc production with reduced scrap and relatively low labor costs” said francis defoor global market segment leader transportation hexion “it complements our full range of products for compression molding including resin transfer molding rtm liquid compression molding lcm and prepreg molding” the new epoxy
