investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a

abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio
