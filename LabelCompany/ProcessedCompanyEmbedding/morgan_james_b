hunter cd music product description the sophomore album from morgan james s hunter features the broadway vocalists mix of retrorb and sinfluenced singersongwriter soul ostensibly james debut album hunter actually follows up her  nina simone tribute concert recording morgan james live from dizzys club cocacola that said hunter is james first recording of alloriginal material and in that sense a much more personal statement than her live debut produced by jazz and bluegrass guitarist doug wamble hunter finds james delving deeply into a collection of tunes that while not show tunes in any sense still make clever use of her stagehoned chops it also doesnt hurt that wamble an experienced musician with a wealth of musical skill and crossgenre knowledge has assembled a backing band that features a bevy of heavyweight jazz artists including acclaimed pianist robert glasper saxophonist ron blake trumpeter ravi best and others however rather than having james focus on jazz standards or even jazzinfluenced pop songs wamble helped the vocalist craft an rbinflected album that brings to mind classic artists like carole king and hall  oates as well as more contemporary singers including beyonc� and the late amy winehouse james who made her broadway debut in  alongside nathan lane in the addams family has a big resonant voice with a ton of flexibility perfectly suited for such crisp soulful cuts as heart shake and bring yourself to me elsewhere she delves into several equally compelling bluesy midtempo numbers including you never lied and drown ultimately its that voice  matched with wambles superb musical vision  that creates the soulful exuberant vibe of hunter  matt collarpersonnel morgan james vocals background vocals recording information brooklyn recording brooklyn ny

the first out hockey player or worse getting involved with one of his teammates but things change dante baltierra is gabe’s polar opposite—careless reckless… shameless but his dedication to the sport is impressive and gabe can overlook a lot of youngandstupid in the name of great hockey and dante has a superlative ass in a sport filled with superlative asses before gabe can figure out how to deal a tabloid throws him out of his comfortable closet into a brandnew world amid the emotional turmoil of invasive questions nasty speculation and on and office homophobia his game suffers surprisingly it’s dante who drags him out of it—and then drags him into something else nothing good can come of secretly sleeping with a teammate especially one gabe has feelings for but with their captain out with an injury a rookie in perpetual need of a hug and the race to make the playoffs for the first time since  gabe has a lot on his plate he can’t be blamed for forgetting that nothing stays secret

honestly some of the best ive read out of everything ive read in the genre from dreamspinner and other publishers their stories are real with relatable characters and storylines that especially in the case of winging it offer more than just romance and the warm and fuzzies i actually learned more about hockey than id ever cared to know but in a highly entertaining way so props for making me care
