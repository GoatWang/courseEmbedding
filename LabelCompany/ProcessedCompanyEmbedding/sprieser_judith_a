judith sprieser by mel duvall  february    ceo transora judith sprieser turned a lot of heads when she decided last summer to take on the role of chief executive of transora a marketplace formed by  of the worlds largest consumer products companiessprieser was a leading contender to eventually take the top job at sara lee a chicagobased consumer products powerhouse with more than  billion in annual sales at  she was ceo of sara lees food division and one of the highestprofile female executives in the usthe bottom line is i felt this was too great an opportunity and too important to our industry to pass up she says it would have to be that important to derail me from the track i was onsix months into her job sprieser says she has been continually surprised by the level of cooperation she gets from members of the exchange companies like johnson  johnson kraft foods and procter  gamble — fierce competitors for more than a century — regularly send top executives and strategists to transoras main offices to collaborate on the projectfurther reading arista stops importing switches involved in dispute att modernizing network with white box switches more challenging has been the

frustration to discover just how young the technology isthe companies backing the exchange are confident however in spriesers ability to not only see through the smoke and mirrors but to ensure transora is a financial success shes jumped into the job with supreme confidence says stephen david chief information officer at procter  gamble who was part of the ceo selection committee thats going
