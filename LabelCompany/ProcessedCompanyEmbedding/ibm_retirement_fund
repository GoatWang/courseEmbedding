material terms and conditions mr jetter accepted the conversion and became a participant in the ivp and therefore he has two entitlements i the monthly pension according to the closed app defined benefit plan earned through december   the date of the conversion “prior benefit” and ii the new cash entitlements earned since  through january   under the ivp “new benefit” mr jetter’s prior benefit is calculated using creditable compensation and service as of december   and shall be increased as follows achievable pension — which is calculated based on years of service up to age  and creditable salary as of december   vested pension — vested part of the achievable pension is calculated by multiplying the achievable pension by the ratio where the numerator is the years of service up to the conversion and the denominator is the employee’s years of service until the employee has reached age  plus growing vested pension — the portion of the benefit that continues to increase until a pensionable event occurs the increase is determined based on individual salaries up to the relevant key date as compared to december   mr jetter’s new benefit is comprised of ibm germany contributions as long as the participant has not terminated employment from ibm germany ibm germany provides a contribution on december  each year until the participant turns  and a prorated contribution if a participant terminates prior to december  for mr jetter the ibm germany contribution was   per year times the total sum of his monthly pensionable earnings during the calendar year which is  of mr jetter’s monthly gross earnings as mr jetter separated from ibm germany in january  he received a prorated contribution in  the contributions earn a guaranteed return rate of  while the participant is

pension from the statutory pension insurance or a similar institution the prior benefit and the new benefit have different payment rules payment of prior benefit the prior benefit is paid as an annuity paid monthly and generally starts the month following the month in which the pensionable event has occurred however at retirement mr jetter can elect to have the entire prior benefit paid as a lump sum payment or as eight installment payments payment of new benefit the new benefit is paid in eight annual installments each installment is increased by  after  months in each case from the date of the pensionable event up to the due date of the relevant installment prorated if less than  months the first installment is due and payable at the end of the fourth calendar month after the date on which the pensionable event has occurred and all following installments will occur that time each year thereafter for seven years however at retirement mr jetter can elect to have the entire new benefit paid in a lump sum payment compensation elements included in calculations eligible compensation for the prior benefit is the total amount of salary and recurring payments under any form of variable compensation plan including annual incentive program payments eligible compensation for the new benefit is the total amount of salary earned while eligible for contributions into the new benefit under ivp equity compensation — stock options rsus rrsus and psus — was excluded from eligible compensation for both the prior benefit and new benefit plan funding mr jetter’s benefit is funded in part by an irrevocable contractual trust to which ibm germany makes contributions the remainder of his benefit under ivp is a direct promise to pay which is unfunded but is reinsured by the ibm deutschland pensionskasse vvag policy regarding extra years of credited service mr jetter’s years of credited service under ivp are based only on his service as an ibm germany employee mr jetter’s

makeover ibms pension team has restructured  billion in global assets to cut costs improve returns and make ibm pension plans in  countries work more closely together heres how by randy myers  february  ibms pension team has restructured  billion in global assets to cut costs improve returns and make ibm pension plans in  countries work more closely together heres howa cold february day in  may have been the most traumatic of tom cadigans career shortly after the yearveteran ibm executive walked into the offices of the ibm retirement funds in stamford connecticut he and a senior colleague met quietly with  of their copension staffers oneonone to tell them their jobs had been eliminatedit was very difficult recalls cadigan who four months later was named an assistant treasurer of ibm and managing director of ibm retirement funds one of the worlds largest pension operations we were  people planning to go to  and overnight we went to  he says obviously we had to change our prioritieschange indeed or sink eleven months earlier lou gerstner the hardcharging executive who had turned around rjr nabiscoand downsized its corporate and pension operations in the processhad taken the reins of thenstruggling ibm after bringing aboard chryslers jerry york a renowned costcutter as his cfo the two went to work reducing costs and focusing the computer giants attention on its core competencies shedding or outsourcing everything elseactive inhouse management of pension assets was not one of big blues core competencies gerstner and new york concluded that the entire pension operation one of the biggest in the us could be run more efficiently and successfully and with less risk if they outsourced the taskthere were three fundamental factors behind the decision to reduce the pension staff and core competency was actually the lesser of the three explains york now vice chairman of investor kirk kerkorians tracinda corporationthe more important factor to yorks mind was eliminating the risk of internal error or even sabotagealthough he stresses that he had absolutely no reason to think that anybody on board at that time would engage in such activity i am just a lot more comfortable if there is a problem in having it come from some external manager in a fiduciary positionsomeone working for a firm that has the proverbial deep pockets with the appropriate bonding capacity and insurance policies that will allow you to recover york saysthe third factor was that i think its incredibly difficult to outperform the market he adds and the more managers you have internally the more difficult it is to do that because some are going to overperform and some are going to underperform that was the nubbintom cadigan joined ibm in  and has enjoyed a sparkling career after spending  years in operational financeincluding seven at ibm europes paris headquartershe moved to treasury for  years before joining the ibm retirement funds in the office he is both formal and graciouschange of dutiesthe story of how he and his small team of  additional professionalsplus five support staffcoped with the restructuring shows how a pension team can change itself for the better even during a difficult downsizing ibms trim new pension operation has posted benchmarkbeating investment returns since  and it has done so with leadingedge attention to risk management that helped earn it a rare superior rating in a tough corporatewide audit last yearthey are as disciplined and focused on risk control as any large pension fund i work with says thomas healey managing director in charge of pension services at goldman sachs which is one of the ibm retirement funds brokers and also manages portions of its fixed income and real estate portfolios it is a hallmark of the way they run their business and it goes through everything they doactual operating costs at the ibm retirement funds have not declined as a result of the downsizing outside vendors are almost always more costly than employees after all but the reorganization did allowif not forcecadigan and his team to focus on the goal most important to the parent company beating the funds benchmark while controlling risknew priorities meant deep changes in how the slimmeddown pension staff operates cadigan put a senior member of his team global funds management director rl jay vivian in charge of risk management and reviewed and tightened risk controls from top to bottom to leverage ibms pension expertise in the us and  foreign countries he encouraged greater sharing of information by consolidating custodial operations worldwide among a handful of global custody banks and with its us custodian ibm developed a central information source accessible to all of its pension operations worldwidecadigan also leveraged his groups established expertise in passive equity management to control trading costs and finally the ibm retirement funds team moved to a significantly greater reliance on passive money management today about  of assets are indexed versus  before tom cadigan pulled together a group of people in circumstances where there was turbulence and chaos and now has them working as a team headed in the same direction says ibm treasurer jeffrey serkesthe payoff net of fees ibms us defined benefit plan posted an  total return over the three years ended last september or  basis points over its benchmark which is an amalgam of indices reflecting the various asset classes in which it invests see chart right its numbers were even more impressive for the  months ended in september when its  total return exceeded the benchmark by  basis points a key contributor has been stellar returns in fixed income due partly to some wellplaced bets on high yield and emerging markets debt which have outpaced treasuries and investmentgrade corporates in recent yearshelped in part by the solid investment returns plan assets climbed from  billion at the end of  to  billion after last years third quarter over the same period assets in ibms k plan grew from  billion to  billion combined with some  billion in both defined benefit and defined contribution assets at its nonus subsidiariesa greater international pension presence than any other us companyibm now has a total of  billion under management that makes it one of the four largest private us pension sponsors along with fellow corporate icons general motors att and general electricchanging liabilitiesthe winnowing of ibms pension management team could hardly have come at a more critical time nineteen ninetyfour would prove a rotten year for the financial markets as they wrestled with how to increase returns cadigan and his team also had to accommodate a dramatic change in the nature of their liabilitiesin  big blues workforce had peaked at  by the end of  it had dwindled to just under a  decline employment has grown again since then to nearly  the company had  active participants in its defined benefit plan in  and  inactive by the end of  it had  active participants and  inactiveten years ago  of the net present value of our defined benefit plan liabilities were associated with active younger employees confirms james rich the retirement funds senior investment strategist now  of our liability is associated with nonactive employeeswere paying about  billion a year in benefits adds cadigan ten years ago what we paid in benefits was almost not a consideration one result a new level of attention to riskwhen we started says vivian who also enforces money manager guidelines we defined risk management as monitoring unintended investment risks such as derivatives exposures of the sort that made headlines at procter  gamble and gibson greetings in  but we soon recognized that there are many other risks and that they encompass our entire operations from things such as network security and physical security to it information technology supportlowering trading costsone of the biggest concentrations of pension assets in the worldsome  billionis run out of  summer street an unpretentious but striking sevenstory structure in downtown stamford connecticut ibm retirement funds is housed on the first floor of that dualaddress building downstairs from ge investments the  billion pension management arm of general electric company which also manages  billion for outside investors similar in size and prestige the two operations could hardly be more different in other waysge manages the vast majority of its assets internally relying on its own research staff and its unique access to ge managers in diverse industries to find attractive investments see plan sponsor profile plan sponsor may  ibm today farms out its entire actively managed portfolio ibm retirement funds has outsourced other functions as well such as tracking dividends and making sure they are paid on timein the end cadigan thinks the net valueexcess return minus the costthat his team gets is still the best that claim is borne out by torontobased consultant cost effective management which surveys pension sponsors to measure the effectiveness of their investment policy decisions and calculate a valueadded comparison a cem survey shows ibm in the top  of the  largest funds for the past three years and in the top  of cems entire fund universeone reason a heavy focus on controlling costs in its investment program since the end of  ibm has reduced its contingent of outside money managers to  from  it now outsources its actively managed equities fixed income real estate and private investmentsbut ibm continues to run passive equity management or indexing internally this is for two reasons first internal portfolio management director charles maxfields indexing group which runs about  of the funds total equities has proven it can do the job as well as anybody and for less cost for example ibms standard  poors  index portfolio costs less than  basis point annually to runmore importantly keeping the index operation inhouse allows ibm to avoid trading costs maxfield and his staff have ready and virtually costfree access to most securities its active managers might want to buy or sell when they make portfolio changes or when their relationship with ibm is initiated or terminatedi call charlie the gearbox of the fund cadigan says of maxfield if we would decide to shift more money to international equities and less to domestic equities just to use an example we would run that through charlies group if we hire a new manager we take the stocks from the old manager give them to charlie and then ask the new manager what stocks he would like to start off with in his portfolio we will cut them out of charlies holdings and hand the manager a portfolio thats ready to go on the day we start the clock running that activity alone saves us tens of millions of dollars a year we not only avoid transaction costs but the costs associated with market impactmanaging other portfolio shifts efficiently this way takes real size since raiding your index portfolio can temporarily throw its carefully constructed composition out of whack but for a plan of ibms bulk that impact is quite modest with some  billion allocated to passive equity management ibm retirement funds is already one of the worlds largest indexers of us and nonus equities alikenow cadigan is starting to leverage maxfields expertise further by allowing him to manage both domestic and international passive equity for some of ibms overseas pension plans and maxfields group is branching out into enhanced indexing in may  cadigan permitted one of maxfields bright young assistants senior portfolio manager scott baum to launch a modestnow  millionenhanced index portfolio benchmarked against the russell its not an active stockpicking account cadigan says a pure russell  index fund would have to own  stocks and even pure indexers dont do thatit would be very expensive and inflexible so everybody uses optimizers which is taking you one step away from pure indexing and this is just one more stepbig blue also leverages its buying power to help its k plan rather than choosing from popular but expensive mutual funds sold to retail investors ibms k participants select from a menu of company stock plus seven core funds and four life strategy funds the latter tailored to participants with varying investment objectives and levels of risk tolerance ibm chose to use institutional money managers when it launched the plan in  and in recent years this has proved to be an appealing strategy to other large employers that want to cut costs and extend proven managers services to the k side see all together now plan sponsor decemberjanuary the result ibm plan participants enjoy their k benefits at a total costmanagement plus administrative feesof just  basis points with only about a quarter of that amount going to money managers by contrast many popular mutual funds charge management fees that alone exceed  basis pointsa push to outperformwhile maxfield seeks to match the russell  senior investment manager robert ploder strives to beat the index by  basis points net of costs limiting his overall tracking error to  basis points ploder is a manager of managers he oversees  firms that actively run  billion of the ibm retirement funds domestic equitiesthose managers have collectively fallen short of their performance goal over the past three years but they have improved recently outpacing the russell by  basis points for the  months ended september  and  basis points in third quarter  one reason why is that ploder likes to take small bets on a wide spectrum of stocks rather than concentrating on a few broad market sectors and largecap issues finally surrendered their market leadership role during the third quarter to midcap and smallcap stocksibm tries to limit the tilt in either directiongrowth versus value or largecap versus smallcapto a total tracking error of no more than  basis points this contributes to risk control says ploder a veteran wall street analyst and money manager before joining ibm six years ago it also reflects the fact that ibm is not trying to time market style or size moves he sayswhile ibms active equity managers have been benchmark stragglers their fixed income counterparts have been on a tear in aggregate ibms  billion in domestic fixed income portfolios posted average annualized returns of  for the three years ended in september or a whopping  basis points more than the benchmark lehman brothers aggregate indexcredit is shared by ibms  outside bond managers and by jae park senior investment manager who oversees the fixed income side park uses managers with a variety of investment styles to keep their aggregate tracking error versus the lehman under  basis points to prevent any surprises he requires them to submit regular reports identifying key risk factors in their portfolios including effective duration yield curve risk sector weightings and duration and credit quality and every month a consultant in san francisco runs a risk and performance attribution analysis on each manager to keep park on top of any shifts in his fixed income porfoliospark has also written proprietary software for the ibm retirement funds with which he and his colleagues evaluate their active money managers as refined by ray kanner the funds global equity manager the software produces what ibm calls performance evaluation profiles or pep charts a cornucopia of statistics these show how active managers have performed in various investment environments and compare their riskperformance tradeoffspulling together globallycadigan wants more of this kind of knowledge sharing under his leadership the pension team is leveraging the tools and skill sets it developed for the domestic portfolio to help improve management of its  billion domestic k plan and of its foreign subsidiaries pension plansthe treasury officials who run pension plans at ibms affiliates in  countries outside the usthe largest ibm germany has about  billion in assets while five other plans have over  billiondo not report to cadigan instead they typically report to one of three regional treasurers based in big blues european latin american and asia pacific regional treasury centers who in turn report to treasurer serkesbut the companys farflung foreign pension chiefs do rely on cadigan and his staff for adviceand in some cases morecadigans office manages an sp  index fund for ibm germany and two portfolios for ibm canada

planeach has different fiduciary regulatory and legal standards to meet not to mention different benefit levels and payment schemesinstead of looking for onesizefitsall answers cadigan and serkes have focused on developing what they call a virtual investment management organization independent of ibms organizational lines when ibm netherlands needs a european equity manager for example it does not make sense to ignore work that ibm germany might have already done in that areaor vice versamaking all new manager selections today are a team of representatives from an ibm unit in a major country outside the us the us fund and a regional support group cadigan and his team also hold pension university a twiceayear seminar that hosts about  professionals from ibm offices around the world and they communicate frequently with ibms foreign pension chiefs through the companys lotus notes email system and videoconferencingkey to this information sharing effort has been the formation of a network of global custody banks currently chase manhattan bank is custodian for the us and german plans while state street bank  trust and northern trust split duties for the other nonus pension funds these banks perform most of the accounting and administrative chores that ibm retirement funds performed inhouse before it restructured in early chase also provides ibm with an innovative product called master record keeper or mrk a central repository from which cadigan and his staff can access data from any big blue pension plan worldwide see pushing the data frontier plan sponsor julyaugust  developed with much input from the client the system supplies information including performance and performance attribution data at any level that ibm desires down to individual securitiesthe master record keeper allows us to take scarce ibm staff out of the report preparation business and focus them more on investment management where they can add a lot more value adds cadigan it also provides a common database of fund and manager performance which we all have access to and usethe futurehas ibm achieved its pension goals cadigan and his team continue to push for enhanced global coordination among ibms pension plans throughout the world the stamford staff see opportunities for more cooperation in the use of consultants actuarial services staffing and systems to name only a few examples they also are expanding their focus on expense control and continuing to refine their risk and information management systems and on the investment side they are paying increased attention to the assetliability dynamicno immediate crisis looms rich calculates the us plans liabilities out to the year  at  billion although their net present value is only about  billion that of course is about  billion less than plan assets a circumstance appreciated at ibm headquarters in armonk new yorkibm was last forced to make a contribution to its defined benefit plan in  treasurer serkes says its current overfunded position indicates that ibm should not have to make any additional contributions certainly for five to  years and probably longer than thatall of which pleases ibms treasurer im happy with the performance of our retirement funds and with the people he concludes and im also happy with their attitudenot just in the us but around the world where people have come to appreciate

blue is halting contributions to its pension fund and shifting workers to an expanded k by stephen shankland january    pm pst ibm announced major changes in its retirement plan on thursday freezing its pension fund and shifting employees instead to an expanded k in a move the company said would save it billions of dollars in coming years ibm will stop contributing to its pension fund on dec   the company said employee benefits from that defined benefit plan will remain fixed instead of growing each year at that point it will begin a new k defined contribution plan into which it will pay as much as  percent of an employees annual salary the change should save  million to  million in  and  billion to  billion for  through  based on current pension assumptions ibm said however the technology giant expects to record a onetime  million charge related to the change in its fourth quarter of  were taking these actions to better control retirement plan expenses position the company for business growth and competitive strength and preserve employees earned retirement benefits while instituting a leadingedge k plan that will be one of the richest in the country and a standard in the united states randy macdonald ibms senior vice president of human resources said in a statement we also believe these are prudent and balanced steps at a time of uncertainty and conflicting legislative and regulatory directions about defined benefit retirement plans in the united states ibm has made several changes to its retiree plans already the company modified its pension plan in  a move that led to legal battles with newer employees starting in  new employees werent offered a pension at all there are two general types of retirement plans defined benefit plans such as pensions in which an employer makes payments to retirees based on factors such as years of service and defined contribution plans such as ks in which employers contribute money to investments that the employee manages the shift away from traditional pensions is becoming common as companies shun the uncertainties and often significant costs of pensions and try to become more competitive said dallas salisbury president of the employee benefit research institute carrying a very different cost structure than your competitors and having an element of unpredictability relative to competitors has caused many companies to move away from defined benefit plans salisbury said one problem has been that pension funds are related to unpredictable interest rates or investment returns which mean pensionholding companies have to pay correspondingly unpredictable amounts of money into them  comes along and causes your pension portfolio to go down and causes it to look like you didnt earn any money salisbury said those uncertainties are being increased by legislative changes he added another complication of defined benefit plans has been the required payments to the pension benefit guarantee corp a federal entity established to protect pensions ibm expected to pay  million to the pbgc in  but because of low shortterm interest rates the company had to pay  billion for the year the company said ibms action wont affect current retirees or those who retire by dec   the company said among retirees  percent are expected to have the same or better benefits under the new plan ibm spokesman clint roswell said the remaining  percent are people in the old pension plan who were still relatively far away from retirement age he said and that population will receive on average  percent less than they would have under the old pension plan the new  plan will have three categories of employees roswell said for those with the pre pension plan ibm will match contributions of up to  percent of an employees salary and add  percent on top for those in the pension plan that ran through  ibm will match  percent and add  percent for those hired in  or later it will match  percent and add  percent ibms k is relatively munificent salisbury said if you focus exclusively on the relative generosity of defined contribution plans ibms defined contribution plans are in the top  to  percent he said among k plans theyre in the top  percent ibms pension fund has more than  billion in assets and its k plan has more than  billion in assets the company said more than  percent of its employees in the united states already were members of the k plan close discuss ibm freezes pension switches to k guidelines log in please log in to cnet to comment post comment as next article cartoon bunnies are
