dec    pm edt    by tracey ryniec equity strategist and portfolio manager zacks investment research     view all   editor’s note this column is part of our best stocks for  contest tracey ryniec’s pick for the contest is ulta salon cosmetics  fragrance inc nasdaqulta if you had to choose one stock to buy for  your first thoughts probably wouldn’t go to the retail names  was in general a terrible year for america’s retailers while employment continued to improve and wages finally started to rise the consumer was in a funk while they might have bought those tools from home depot inc nysehd they completely shunned clothes of any kind and turned their backs on the big department stores in the weeks leading up to the presidential election most retailers reported an even further slowdown in spending it’s almost as if the consumer was paralyzed but the postelection world is a very different place retailers who reported earnings after the november election almost unequivocally said they saw a big jump in business in the weeks afterwards consumers were spending again will these new animal spirits last until  no one knows but many economic fundamentals seem to support the idea that this pickup in consumer spending and sentiment could have legs the  best stocks to buy for  the employment market continues to heat up there’s also the possibility of infrastructure spending and tax cuts in the new year which could boost economic growth further additionally the importance of the stock market indexes trading at new alltime highs shouldn’t be dismissed when investors look at their investment statements and they see those balances rising it can also boost the animal spirits they feel richer and when they feel richer they spend more the first rule of investing buy the best if consumers are opening their wallets again then investors should be in the very best of the retail group and there can be only one name that falls into that category ulta salon cosmetics  fragrance inc nasdaqulta ulta sells beauty products and operates salons in  stores in  states and the district of columbia right now ulta stock is the only retailer that is producing doubledigit comparablestoresales quarter after quarter and year over year additionally unlike most other retailers in  ulta didn’t see its business slow during the year quite the opposite occurred it has actually accelerated here are the quarterly comparablestoresales for  and  fiscal  comparable stores sales growth fiscal  comparable store sales growth q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q    what other retailer is doing comparable store growth of  like ulta did in the third quarter of this year no one it’s not even close ulta stands alone why ulta crushes it how is ulta stock able to achieve this kind of success when other retailers have been faltering let’s be frank it helps that it’s not an apparel retailer makeup in particular has been an especially strong retail product line for the last several years and shows no signs of slowing down but outside of its products it’s also doing several things right that allow it to trounce the competition  best rewards program in the business first it has the best rewards program the ultamate rewards in the retail industry the rewards program now accounts for  of all sales the reason it is so great is that it legitimately gives customers rewards it makes it easy to accumulate points which can then be applied to other products so a customer in the program knowing that they will get good freebies will try and make as many purchases as they can through the rewards not only will they buy their makeup at ulta but also buy their shampoo and even get their haircut there just to accumulate points the rewards program also provides a moat against amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn and other online retailers why would women buy their makeup on ultacom instead of amazon which often carries the same items sometimes for less because they don’t get points on amazon points and the rewards that come with them are the name of the game it has created an incredibly loyal customer base next page     view all view all   article printed from investorplace media
