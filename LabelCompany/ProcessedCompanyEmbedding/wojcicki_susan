today mountain view calif  susan wojcicki is reminiscing about her old home in menlo park calif its a very humble house less than  square feet she recalls fondly a cozy fourbedroom home — and incredibly historic after earning her mba in  wojcicki bought  santa margarita ave for about  she rented the garage to two stanford students for  a month to help with the mortgage the renters no ordinary slackers but the google guys larry page and sergey brin who incubated googlegoog right there its a good reminder for the company that we did come from a small house not a fancy house says wojcicki her lifechanging decision to open her home to brin and page did more than just help start the worlds mostpopular search engine it also •landed wojcicki a key early job at google less than a year after purchasing the home today shes one of its topranked executives overseeing the crucial online advertising business as vice president of product management •introduced a future husband to wojcickis younger sister anne who recently married brin on an island in the bahamas google has invested  million in anne wojcickis biotech startup andme •created a cottage industry for the wojcicki family susan wojcickis husband dennis troper is an operations executive at google brotherinlaw gregor married to middle sister janet is a former googler who worked in the finance department mom esther wojcicki a teacher has consulted for google on educational issues if youve ever clicked a text ad on myspace aboutcom or any thousands of blogs with ads by google youve got susan wojcicki to thank expanding ads beyond googles own search pages was her idea now google has asked her to further grow the empire by bringing its advertiser base to old media such as newspapers magazines radio and television there are no sets of words that can be used to describe susans contribution to the company says google ceo eric schmidt shes historic in terms of our companys founding shes also one of those people who thinks very broadly and quickly and its deceiving because shes so pleasant wojcicki is google employee no  her early duties included refining the original google logo designed by brin and the overall spare look of the google home page she came up with the first of googles doodles the remaking of the logo for holidays and other special events her first artistic doodle an alien lands on google in googles fledgling days wojcicki a former junior staffer for chipmaker intel was in charge of marketing efforts brin and page charged her with spreading the word about google on a shoestring her big idea stir wordofmouth by putting googles search engine all over the web she reached out to companies to license google search for their websites and offered it free to universities in  she came up with her multimilliondollar brainstorm adsense a really novel idea adsense is an extension of a program google had successfully launched in  called adwords adwords offers advertisers sponsored search ads those little text ads that appear near search results advertisers have to pay only if the ads get clicked wojcickis suggestion why not offer these same ads all over the web on blogs and websites entice web publishers to participate by giving them a portion of the ad revenue in other words every time someone clicks on an ad on your site you get a check heres how the ads are targeted lets say youre reading about computers at tech site engadget an ad might appear offering special deals at dellcom or if youre reading an article at a news site about attorney general alberto gonzales you might see an ad for a local criminaldefense law firm thats adsense it was a really novel idea at the time to serve ads that were targeted dynamically to a specific web page says wojcicki sitting in a conference room at the googleplex company headquarters people were saying this is a sports site so well serve a sports ad and we were saying no we can actually look at the page in real time and figure out what this page is about  wojcickis idea turned into a runaway smash google doesnt break out revenues from adsense and adwords but the company recently reported quarterly profit of  billion virtually all derived from both ad programs thousands of tiny entrepreneurs make substantial livings by hosting ads by google links at their websites more people make money from adsense than any other vehicle on the web says jennifer slegg who runs jensense a blog devoted to adsense there are many many adsense millionaires adsense basically turned the web into a giant google billboard says danny sullivan editor of search engine land website it effectively meant that google could turn everyones content into a place for google ads for her efforts wojcicki earned a google founders award a financial incentive provided to employees to create new ideas spokesman david krane says its designed to keep employees and give them the same kind of economic award they would receive if they had formed their own companies krane wont disclose how much current founders awards are worth but the first two awarded to googlers not to wojcicki were  million each venturing into offline ads creating things has kept wojcicki at google over the years i love taking an idea … to a prototype and then to a product that millions of people use she says people write in from all over the world giving you feedback telling us how a product adsense changed their lives how they were able to start a business with it and thats just incredibly rewarding her next big challenge translating googles simple measurable advertising network to radio tv and print ever wanted to run an ad on the radio but didnt know how to set it up google has an audio ads section on its website with links to radio producers who will create an ad for  to  select stations and time slots and youre on the air the radio venture recently left test mode and is open to the general public google is testing the concept in print and on tv that test is available only to a small percentage of advertisers sullivan and other google analysts are skeptical about the nascent programs chances with radio ads sullivan says google will give information on when the ad played with more data than before but that still doesnt prove that anyone heard the ad they havent done anything innovative or different to show if the ad really worked a real challenge ahead bringing the google ad network to old media will be a real challenge says greg sterling an independent analyst at sterling market intelligence the ability to serve a relevant ad against someones query is one of the great innovations of the internet and its not transferable to other media where people are more passive wojcicki concedes that ads on tv and radio wont be as measurable but she says such ads placed through google will have more data to mine than old media currently provide thanks to googles obsessive tracking of numbers via its network of computers for example in tv we can provide secondbysecond data on whats being watched on the ad she says she cautions that its still very early for google radio the first things were doing are really just providing online ways for people to purchase the inventory easier raised in silicon valley wojcicki has plenty of experience at being eyewitness to a forming business brin and page originally met her and landed at the menlo park house via a friend of wojcickis who was dating brin the house that gave birth to google was always filled with mutual friends wojcicki says most of them techies themselves their no  question for brin and page back then who needs yet another search engine the answer  not another but a better search engine  wojcicki recalls from the beginning they had a very clear vision that they could build something much better than what existed at the time wojcicki grew up in palo alto on the campus of stanford university dad stanley wojcicki chairs stanfords physics department mom esther a journalism teacher at palo alto high school says she expected susan to become an english professor instead after a postcollege job at educational software firm magicquest she was bitten by the tech bug now google is such a presence in their lives that the wojcickis try to limit familytime chatter about the company esther says though not always successfully its so innovative and exciting theyre doing all sorts of interesting things and its fun to hear about it that so many of her relatives were drawn to google isnt unusual says susan wojcicki there are lots of people in the silicon valley who are interested in working at a fastmoving dynamic company like google she says not just my family members meanwhile the humble house where google was incubated was purchased by google in september google wont disclose how much it paid but homes in the neighborhood sell for more than  million i havent had time to think about what well do with it says ceo schmidt

wojcicki  the woman who brings online offline and bottom line together susan wojcicki google’s senior vicepresident of product management who oversees all of the technology giant’s advertising products has quite a lot riding on her quite simply she is the woman tasked with generating pc of google’s vast revenues susan wojcicki is the boss of adsense the advertising business that accounts for pc of revenue at google it was in her garage that the search engine was created  by emma barnett am gmt  dec  follow comments in a rare uk interview the woman who gave google cofounders larry page and sergey brin their first humble office premises her garage in  reveals her vision for google’s hugely successful search advertising business “yes i did rent my garage out to larry and sergey in  i had just got out of business school and bought a house so i needed to get some renters in order to help pay the mortgage” she says coolly it was undoubtedly the best investment she ever made however despite their repeated requests wojcicki resisted working for the new young company called google for the first year the two developers beavered away in her garage however at apoint during  wojcicki said she had her “aha” moment when she knew she had to start working for google “i was online desperately trying to search for something and couldn’t access google for some reason and then couldn’t find any information i needed i suddenly thought getting information you need is going to become very important online that’s when i started working for google” she explains google employee number  of a whopping strong global workforce some  years later wojcicki is largely referred to as the woman who created adsense – a key component of google’s hugely successful search advertising system which sells relevant display advertising to companies having started as the company’s marketing manager she now oversees all of google’s advertising products including adwords adsense and doubleclick

british television personal  mar  twitter eyes bn mobile users  jul  americans spend most of web time on facebook  jul  according to its last financial report google’s total revenue for q  was bn – the majority of which comes from wojcicki’s department this week of course google has been in the news after the european commission announced a formal inquiry into how it manages its ranking of companies in search and how it then advertises against those rankings the ec’s move came after complaints from three internet companies who alleged they were the victims of search “penalties” which had put their businesses at risk wojcicki is clear in her answer – google which dominates the search market makes every attempt to be transparent and will look at ways to improve even the ec admitted that it wasn’t yet clear that google had a serious case to answer “given our success and the disruptive nature of our business it’s understandable that we’ve caused unease among other companies and caught the attention of regulators” she said “we respect this process and will continue to work closely with the european commission to answer their questions but one thing that’s often overlooked is that we actually provide more information about how our ranking works than any other major search engine on the advertising side we give our customers lots of information about how the ad auction works as well as tips on how to improve their ad quality scores and the ability to simulate their bids to give them more transparency ” google insiders know that success often breeds suspicion particularly if that success is based on new technology which few people outside the business actually understand when asked if adsense was her creation wojcicki’s becomes a little uncomfortable saying “it’s a controversial question – various people had the idea but what i can say is that i was the first product manager who worked on it and made it happen i was one of the key people who brought it adsense together “i am also the only person who has worked on adsense for the last eight years continually and i am responsible for google’s advertising system – which accounts for approximately pc of the company’s revenues” in fact a senior silicon valley executive who wished to remain anonymous goes as far to call wojcicki “the money” in google “if you think about google’s large and everexpanding business very little of its endeavours such as youtube or gmail make profit or any significant revenues” the source said “as useful and great as these services are the money still comes from the same place it has always has done in google – from its unrivalled search advertising business – and that’s wojcicki’s responsibility she is very powerful and hugely influential at google and in silicon valley” recently promoted to an elite group of eight senior vicepresidents at google and a longstanding member of the company’s operating committee wojcicki aware of the impact of her words is unsurprisingly guarded in every reply however despite recurring hesitance when talking about her vision of google’s advertising evolvement she becomes more fluent “right now i am focusing on the power of mobile and location in terms of the endless opportunities for advertisers wanting to get the most out of google” she explains “right now offline and online are coming together because of smartphones “it’s a really rich theme and we are just at the beginning of understanding the possibilities these smartphones have not been around for that long only two and a half years penetration is still growing but already the way that we shop and purchase everything is changing” wojcicki citing a forrester study says that although pc of instore sales are influenced by online only  pc of purchases actually happen online this is where she sees the next big opportunity supported by the fact that there has also been a pc growth according to forrester in mobile shopping queries which shows that people are going online while in shops or near shops to make decisions before buying offline in a very neat addition to its google product search the technology giant has partnered with more than  large retails brands such as best buy in a move which sees the search company receive live feeds of each “partner” store’s stock in real time this means that when someone searches for a specific product on their mobile phone using the google mobile app in the us they will be informed which stores near them at that point in time has the product in which size and how many they have left the stores according to wojcicki already have the data stream so there is no extra work except the act of wiring it up as a feed to google she says that the product is just “the beginning” of what google plans to do to make offline and online come together in a more seamless and useful fashion for both consumer and advertiser alike wojcicki is confident that the service which is currently a free addon to participating brands will be able to operate around the world when asked for her response to those google critics who say that the search giant regularly crosses the “creepy line” on intrusion when expanding its reach with similar innovations wojcicki’s guard reappears after a moment’s thought she says carefully “we are a consumer company and our success is directly linked to our users trusting us therefore we have the same incentive as the user they want to see relevant advertising so their experience of google is positive and we want to deliver it “our interests are aligned with the user” wojcicki’s guard goes up higher still when pressed on what google’s plans are for the cashing in on the social space – an area it is severely lagging behind its competitors such as the fastgrowing facebook earlier this year google was rumoured to be building a facebook rival googleme last week techcrunch reported that the new social product could be called emerald sea or google  wojcicki will not be drawn on the speculation however she admits that “social can be an important way that people make purchase decisions too” and that google is “working on developing products in this area” her pointed silence on this issue over all others speaks volumes location and mobile may be the hot technology themes in  but social is getting hotter by the minute and google has yet to strike it rich in this area – which wojcicki will undoubtedly be working on improving video is another area where she is focusing her energy – especially as youtube needs to start finally paying its way since google purchased the once lossmaking company in  “we are testing a lot of products around video advertising at the moment – which are doing well at better targeting” she said “one thing i am excited about is offering people a range of very relevant advertising videos before or alongside a piece of video content which people can choose from i think video advertising is a hugely compelling medium” however wojcicki’s remit does not stretch to answering questions about google tv’s commercial plans despite the commercial video solution being key to its implementation the new service recently launched in the us against the backdrop of a considerable backlash from certain media outlets fearful of the google experience spreading to tv wojcicki says
