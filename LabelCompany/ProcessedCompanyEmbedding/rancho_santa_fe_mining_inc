proceeds from this offering in the priority set forth below within the first  months after successful completion of this offering not taking into account any possible additional funding or revenues we intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows the following chart indicates the approximate amount of funds that we will allocate to each item but does not indicate the total feecost of each item the amount of proceeds we allocate to each item is dependent upon the amount of proceeds we receive from this offering if we sell all of the shares being offered our net proceeds will be  we will use the net proceeds to pay development costs and to hold and maintain the asset rights as well as complete reserve reports to guide mining efforts and secure optimum profit streams on the mining output such efforts will continue until we become cashflow positive the precise amounts that the company will devote to each of these items and the timing of expenditures will vary depending on numerous factors including but not limited to the progress of development efforts relating to each project the following table sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net proceeds as we currently expect to use them assuming the sale of    and  of the shares offered for sale in this offering assumed percentage of shares sold     price to public         other offering expenses     net proceeds         project development and commercialization         operating expenses     working capital     total use of proceeds         as indicated in the table above if we sell only  or  or  of the shares offered for sale in this offering we would expect to use the resulting net proceeds for the same purposes as we would use the net proceeds from a sale of  of the shares and in approximately the same proportions however the lower our net proceeds the less we would expect to use the funds in the expenditure category “development and commercialization” and the more we would expect to use those funds for the development and commercialization of the assets we have acquired as can be seen in the table the only expenditure that changes relative to the proceeds received in the offering is the “development and commercialization” expenditures forecasted under the circumstance where proceeds received only represent  of the offering expenses that fall under “development and commercialization” include the development of additional mining claims held within the prunty mine area by the company which management feels would be productive in terms of adding to the existing reserve base the reason why only this expenditure is adjusted in the event only  of the target offering proceeds are raised is because the development of additional claims represented by this expenditure are ancillary to the company’s main initial objective of developing its deposits in the event we do not sell all of the shares being offered we may seek additional financing to support the intended use of proceeds discussed above if we secure additional equity funding investors in this offering would be diluted in all events there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available when needed and if available on terms acceptable to us the mining industry is very competitive much of our competition is from larger established mining companies with greater liquidity greater access to credit and other financial resources newer or more efficient equipment lower cost structures more effective risk management policies and procedures andor a greater ability than us to withstand losses our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies and devote greater resources to the expansion or efficiency of their operations in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and gain significant market share to our detriment we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations company description the company was incorporated in the state of

more information” in this prospectus and any amendment or supplement hereto unless otherwise indicated the terms the “company” “rancho santa fe mining” “we” “us” and “our” refer and relate to rancho santa fe mining inc   the company overview   the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on july   we were incorporated and our business plan called for the company to seek out and acquire various mining assets in the state of nevada rancho santa fe mining inc is a precious metals exploration and development company with the objective of becoming a gold producer the company is currently focused on the advancement of its two principal projects the virginia and vanity fair patented claims   on october   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement the “asset purchase” with humboldt mining company inc a nevada corporation “hmci” pursuant to the asset purchase agreement the company acquired  of the assets owned by hmci including but not limited to i all the real property leasehold improvements fixtures furniture machinery and equipment owned by the hmci and relating to or used in hmci’s operations and ii all inventory including finished goods raw materials and work in process as well as the right to receive inventory ordered by the hmci for use in its operations and iii in addition to the foregoing we acquired all the books and records of hmci as well as all intangible assets held owned or controlled by hmci collectively i ii and iii are referred to hereinafter as the “acquired assets” as per the asset purchase we acquired various liabilities of hmci including i the assumption of all liabilities arising out of any unfilled customer orders outstanding as of the date the asset purchase closed the company is entitled to any future payments relating to any payments made pursuant thereto ii the assumption of obligations relating to a lawsuit and default judgment including but not limited to the obligation to pay attorneys’ fees of approximately  and iii inherited hmci’s reclamation liability if any as it is related to the property there are no royalties due or owing on the purchased claims the only amounts due are local property taxes which are assessed annually   in exchange for the acquired assets the company issued to the hmci shareholders thirteen million five hundred thousand  shares of the company’s  par value common stock which represented fifty  percent of the company’s issued and outstanding shares at the time of issuance   the company now owns land and the patented mining rights north of elko nevada nearby the formation known as the carlin trend the company’s property includes two patented claims – the virginia and vanity fair patented claims  comprising what is known as the prunty mine area vanity fair virginia  mining survey number  the  patented mining claims prunty mine – virginia and vanity fair patents total approximately  acres the importance of these patented claims cannot be underestimated we own the patented mining claims and the mineral rights associated with the patents have no expiration date subject to property taxes being paid on the property   operationally the company intends to outsource fully  of the exploration site preparation and extraction operations to a third party who provides all manpower equipment and operational expenses associated therewith insomuch as this work will be outsourced and the company income will be based on profits from the sale of gold recovered by the contractors received therefrom the company cannot speak to the outsourced expenditures related to exploration site preparation and extraction   as such the proceeds will largely be utilized for payroll outsourced consultants and asset maintenance and development the company plans to retain five full time staff and lease nominal executive office facilities in nevada all legal accounting shareholder relations and geology can be outsourced to consultants as needed business development is limited to developing and maintaining a website presence and nominal travel and business entertainment expense the primary additional operations entail asset development which includes the maintenance of applicable permits and claim renewals as well as the outsourced production of independent reserve reports annually      emerging growth company   we are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the federal securities laws for as long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to comply with certain regulatory requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging gr owth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act being permitted to comply with reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and being exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and securing stockholder approval of golden parachute payments we intend to take advantage of these reduced regulatory requirements until we are no longer an emerging growth company for a description of the qualifications and other requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and certain elections we have made due to our status as an emerging growth company see “risk factors— as an ‘emerging growth company’ under applicable law we will be subject to reduced disclosure requirements which could leave our stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies”   risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed currently shares of our common stock are not publicly traded in the event that shares of our common stock become publicly traded the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in the event our common stock fails to become publicly traded you may lose all or part of your investment   risks related to our business and industry   we are an exploration stage company and may never be able to carry out business or achieve any revenues or profitability at this stage even with good faith efforts potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment   we have not earned any revenues as of the date of this current report potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates   there is nothing at this time on which to base an assumption that our business operations will prove to be successful or that we will ever be able to operate profitably we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we therefore expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve any revenues or profitability the revenue and income potential of our proposed business and operations is unproven as the lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the future prospects of our business   we are dependent on our two principal projects for our future operating revenue neither of which currently has proven or probable reserves   the virginia and the vanity fair project do not have identified proven and probable mineral reserves the costs timing and complexities of upgrading either property to proven and probable reserves may be greater than we anticipate mineral exploration and development involves a high degree of risk that even a combination of careful evaluation experience and knowledge cannot eliminate and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines there is no assurance that our mineral exploration programs will establish the presence of any proven or probable mineral reserves the failure to establish proven or probable reserves would severely restrict our ability to implement our strategies for longterm growth      we cannot be certain that our acquisition exploration and evaluation activities will be commercially successful   we currently have no properties that produce gold in commercial quantities substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing mining properties to establish ore reserves through drilling and analysis to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore and in the case of new properties to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining we cannot provide assurance that any gold or other metal reserves or mineralized material acquired or discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely basis factors including costs actual mineralization consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity prices affect successful project development could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations   actual capital costs operating costs production and economic returns may differ significantly from those we have anticipated and there are no assurances that any future development activities will result in profitable mining operations   the capital costs to take our claims into production may be significantly higher than anticipated we may ultimately base our decisions about the development of the projects based on a feasibility study we have not prepared a feasibility study for the either but we may use a portion of the proceeds of the offering to produce one if we deem it necessary or appropriate to do so our evaluations of our business and prospects are subject to change including after any feasibility study has been conducted which could materially adversely affect our prospects    historical production at either of our claims may not be indicative of the potential for future development   there is currently no commercial production at either claim and since acquiring ownership we have never recorded any revenues from commercial production you should not rely on the fact that there were historical mining operations at the either claim as an indication that we will ever have future successful commercial operations in order for us to develop new mining operations we will be required to incur substantial operating expenses and capital expenditures to refurbish andor replace existing infrastructure   land reclamation and mine closure may be burdensome and costly   land reclamation and mine closure requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies which require us to among other things to minimize the effects of land disturbance such requirements may include controlling the discharge of potentially dangerous effluents from a site and restoring a site’s landscape to its preexploration form the actual costs of reclamation and mine closure are uncertain and planned expenditures may differ from the actual expenditures required therefore the amount that we are required to spend could be materially higher than current estimates any additional amounts required to be spent on reclamation and mine closure may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance financial position and results of operations and may cause us to alter our operations in addition we are required to maintain financial assurances such as letters of credit to secure reclamation obligations under certain laws and regulations the failure to acquire maintain or renew such financial assurances could subject us to fines penalties or suspension of our operations additionally even if we cease exploration at either claim we will be required to expend cash and other resources to satisfy ongoing care and maintenance obligations   our operations involve significant risks and hazards inherent to the mining industry   our operations involve the operation of large pieces of drilling and other heavy equipment hazards such as fire explosion floods structural collapses industrial accidents unusual or unexpected geological conditions ground control problems caveins flooding and mechanical equipment failure are inherent risks in our operations hazards inherent to the mining industry can cause injuries or death to employees contractors or other persons at our mineral properties severe damage to and destruction of our property plant and equipment and mineral properties and contamination of or damage to the environment and can result in the suspension of our exploration activities and any future development and production activities while the company aims to maintain best safety practices as part of its culture safety measures implemented by us may not be successful in preventing or mitigating future accidents      the mining industry is very competitive   the mining industry is very competitive much of our competition is from larger established mining companies with greater liquidity greater access to credit and other financial resources newer or more efficient equipment lower cost structures more effective risk management policies and procedures andor a greater ability than us to withstand losses our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies and devote greater resources to the expansion or efficiency of their operations in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties accordingly it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and gain significant market share to our detriment we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   mining exploration development and operating activities are inherently hazardous   mineral exploration involves many risks that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration development and production of gold and other metals any of which could result in work stoppages damage to property and possible environmental damage the nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any liability insurance policy limits it is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable or that the company could elect not to be insured against such liabilities due to high premium costs or other reasons in which event significant costs could be incurred that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   reserve calculations are estimates only subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices inherent variability of ore and recoverability of metals in the mining process   there is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves and corresponding grades dedicated to future production until reserves are actually mined and processed the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only in addition the quantity of reserves and ore may vary depending on metal prices any material change in the quantity of reserves mineralization grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties in addition there can be no assurance that gold recoveries or other metal recoveries in smallscale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under onsite conditions or during production     we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms   the exploration and development of our development properties will require significant capital investment to achieve commercial production we may have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to maintain and advance our existing property positions and to acquire new gold projects there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms and if additional financing is not available we may have to substantially reduce or cease operations   our exploration and eventual development operations are subject to environmental regulations which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays   all phases of operations are subject to environmental regulation environmental legislation is evolving in some jurisdictions in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement increased fines and penalties for noncompliance more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers directors and employees there is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulations if any will not adversely affect the company’s projects we will be subject to environmental regulations with respect to properties in nevada under applicable federal and state laws and regulations production at either claim may involve the use of sodium cyanide which is a toxic material should sodium cyanide leak or otherwise be discharged from the containment system we may become subject to liability for cleanup work that may not be insured while appropriate steps will be taken to prevent discharges of pollutants into the ground water and the environment we may become subject to liability for hazards that it may not be insured against          us federal laws   under the us resource conservation and recovery act mining companies may incur costs for generating transporting treating storing or disposing of hazardous waste as well as for closure and postclosure maintenance once they have completed mining activities on a property mining operations may produce air emissions including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment storage facilities and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment which are subject to review monitoring andor control requirements under the federal clean air act and state air quality laws permitting rules may impose limitations on the company’s production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules   the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla imposes strict joint and several liability on parties associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances the groups who could be found liable include among others the current owners and operators of facilities which release hazardous substances into the environment and past owners and operators of properties who owned such properties at the time the disposal of the hazardous substances occurred this liability could include the cost of removal or remediation of the release and damages for injury to the surrounding property the company cannot predict the potential for future cercla liability with respect to its properties   increased costs could affect our financial condition   we anticipate that costs will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors such as changing ore grade metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body in addition costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel and electricity such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable a material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on profitability   difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations   factors such as business investment government spending the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and ultimately the profitability of our business in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment lower corporate earnings and lower business investment our operations could be negatively impacted purchasers of gold production may delay or be unable to make timely payments adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions     a shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business   we will be dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and development operations the shortage of such supplies equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore limit or increase the cost of production   if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel we may be unable to establish and develop our business   our development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees we do not have and currently have no plans to obtain key man insurance with respect to any key employees we will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons then development and growth could be significantly curtailed   principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the board of directors possibly conflicting with the interests of other stockholders   major shareholders and the president’s position on the board of directors could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control of our business this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or entrenching management or the board of directors which could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and consequently could adversely affect the market price of our common stock      our articles of incorporation exculpates our officers and directors from certain liability to our company or our stockholders   our articles of incorporation contain a provision limiting the liability of our officers and directors for their acts or failures to act except for acts involving intentional misconduct fraud or a knowing violation of law this limitation on liability may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors and may discourage or deter our stockholders from suing our officers and directors based upon breaches of their duties to our company   our internal controls may be inadequate which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that     · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company     · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management andor directors of the company and     · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   our internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision   we have a “going concern” opinion from our auditors indicating the possibility that we may not be able to continue to operate    our independent registered public accountants have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise if we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed we will not be able to complete our proposed business as a result we may have to liquidate our business and investors may lose their investment the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish its plan of operations described herein and eventually attain profitable operations investors should consider our independent registered public accountant’s comments when deciding whether to invest in the company       risks related to the offering   the company’s stock price may be volatile   the market price of the company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential factors many of which will be beyond the company’s control including the following     · competition     · additions or departures of key personnel     · the company’s ability to execute its business plan     · operating results that fall below expectations     · loss of any strategic relationship     · industry developments     · economic and other external factors and     · periodtoperiod fluctuations in the company’s financial results   in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock   we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future   we do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth of our business therefore investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock and stockholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms or at all we cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock   we may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock which would reduce investors’ ownership interests in the company and which may dilute our share value   our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share the future issuance of all or part of our remaining authorized common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   finra sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” has adopted rules that relate to the application of the sec’s penny stock rules in trading our securities and require that a brokerdealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending the investment prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information      under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra’s requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock further many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a shareholder’s ability to resell shares of our common stock   determination of offering price   as a result of there being no established public market for our shares the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by the company and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective criteria of value in addition no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares   use of proceeds   our offering is being made in a direct public offering without the involvement of underwriters or brokerdealers we intend to disburse the proceeds from this offering in the priority set forth below within the first  months after successful completion of this offering   not taking into account any possible additional funding or revenues we intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows the following chart indicates the approximate amount of funds that we will allocate to each item but does not indicate the total feecost of each item  the amount of proceeds we allocate to each item is dependent upon the amount of proceeds we receive from this offering   if we sell all of the shares being offered our net proceeds will be  we will use the net proceeds to pay development costs and to hold and maintain the asset rights as well as complete reserve reports to guide mining efforts and secure optimum profit streams on the mining output such efforts will continue until we become cashflow positive the precise amounts that the company will devote to each of these items and the timing of expenditures will vary depending on numerous factors including but not limited to the progress of development efforts relating to each project the following table sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net proceeds as we currently expect to use them assuming the sale of    and  of the shares offered for sale in this offering   assumed percentage of shares sold                     price to public                         other offering expenses                             net proceeds                                                           project development and commercialization                         operating expenses                             working capital                             total use of proceeds                           as indicated in the table above if we sell only  or  or  of the shares offered for sale in this offering we would expect to use the resulting net proceeds for the same purposes as we would use the net proceeds from a sale of  of the shares and in approximately the same proportions however the lower our net proceeds the less we would expect to use the funds in the expenditure category “development and commercialization” and the more we would expect to use those funds for the development and commercialization of the assets we have acquired as can be seen in the table the only expenditure that changes relative to the proceeds received in the offering is the “development and commercialization” expenditures forecasted under the circumstance where proceeds received only represent  of the offering expenses that fall under “development and commercialization” include the development of additional mining claims held within the prunty mine area by the company which management feels would be productive in terms of adding to the existing reserve base the reason why only this expenditure is adjusted in the event only  of the target offering proceeds are raised is because the development of additional claims represented by this expenditure are ancillary to the company’s main initial objective of developing its deposits      in the event we do not sell all of the shares being offered we may seek additional financing to support the intended use of proceeds discussed above if we secure additional equity funding investors in this offering would be diluted in all events there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available when needed and if available on terms acceptable to us   dividend policy   we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since inception and we currently expect that in the foreseeable future all earnings if any will be retained for the development of our business and no dividends will be declared or paid any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things our earnings if any operating results financial condition and capital requirements general business

transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec that   contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks and contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the sec shall require by rule or regulation    the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with the following prior to proceeding with any transaction in a penny stock   bid and offer quotations for the penny stock details of the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement these disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities   registration rights   we have not granted registration rights to any

was incorporated in the state of nevada on july   we were incorporated and our business plan called for the company to seek out and acquire various mining assets in the state of nevada rancho santa fe mining inc is a precious metals exploration and development company with the objective of becoming a gold producer the company is currently focused on the advancement of its two principal projects the virginia and vanity fair patented claims   on october   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement the “asset purchase” with humboldt mining company inc a nevada corporation “hmci” pursuant to the asset purchase agreement the company acquired  of the assets owned by hmci including but not limited to i all the real property leasehold improvements fixtures furniture machinery and equipment owned by the hmci and relating to or used in hmci’s operations and ii all inventory including finished goods raw materials and work in process as well as the right to receive inventory ordered by the hmci for use in its operations and iii in addition to the foregoing we acquired all the books and records of hmci as well as all intangible assets held owned or controlled by hmci collectively i ii and iii are referred to hereinafter as the “acquired assets” as per the asset purchase we acquired various liabilities of the hmci including i the assumption of all liabilities arising out of any unfilled customer orders outstanding as of the date the asset purchase closed the company is entitled to any future payments relating to any payments made pursuant thereto ii the assumption of obligations relating to a lawsuit and default judgment including but not limited to the obligation to pay attorneys’ fees of approximately  and iii inherited hmci’s reclamation liability if any as it is related to the property there are no royalties due or owing on the purchased claims the only amounts due are local property taxes which are assessed annually   in exchange for the acquired assets the company issued to the hmci shareholders thirteen million five hundred thousand  shares of the company’s  par value common stock which represented fifty  percent of the company’s issued and outstanding shares at the time of issuance      the company now owns land and the patented mining rights north of elko nevada nearby the formation known as the carlin trend the company’s property includes two patented claims – the virginia and vanity fair patented claims  comprising what is known as the prunty mine area vanity fair virginia  mining survey number  the  patented mining claims prunty mine – virginia and vanity fair patents total approximately  acres the importance of these patented claims cannot be underestimated we owned the patented mining claims and the mineral rights associated with the patents have no expiration date subject to property taxes being paid on the property   operationally the company intends to outsource fully  of the exploration site preparation and extraction operations to a third party who provides all manpower equipment and operational expenses associated therewith insomuch as this work will be outsourced and the company income will be based on profits from the sale of gold recovered by the contractors the company cannot speak to the outsourced expenditures related to exploration site preparation and extraction   as such the proceeds will largely be utilized for payroll outsourced consultants and asset maintenance and development the company plans to retain five full time staff and lease nominal executive office facilities in nevada all legal accounting shareholder relations and geology can be outsourced to consultants as needed business development is limited to developing and maintaining a website presence and nominal travel and business entertainment expense the primary additional operations entail asset development which includes the maintenance of applicable permits and claim renewals as well as the outsourced production of independent reserve reports annually     the purpose of this exploration program is to identify a gold ore body geophysics a magnetic survey and gis compilation was commissioned in the summer of  by humboldt mining company the geophysical survey was completed in the field by christopher mcgee and interpreted by james wright of wright geophysics the data returned identified  anomalies on the prunty patented claims these anomalies that are the target of the current exploration program   the exploration drilling will begin as soon as is feasible first the drill hole locations must be identified the anomalies have been identified by the geophysical survey completed in    on the blow up of the  topo map a wd drive road is marked coming up the back north  west side of the prunty ridge from union gulch to the north at present there is no assurance that the usfs united states forest service would allow its use if this road can be used for drill access the drilling could begin as soon as the usfs approves its use the target is on patented claims surrounded by forest service lands with a permitted access road up the front south side to the historic prunty mine area after fording the creek   no drilling can begin until water drops in the creek if  creek is to be forded which at the earliest would be late summer into the fall  the creek needs to be forded and an access road to the proposed drill sites may need to be constructed on patented lands from the mine site the corners of the patented claims would be marked by carlin trend mining services    initial drilling would be completed by a buggy or track mounted rc drill a fence would be drilled across each of the anomalies there are  total with angle drill holes at least one of the anomalies would be drilled as time permits the depth of each drill hole would be no deeper than about  feet and the angle would be no shallower than    at this point in time we do not know how many holes would be needed but based on the map we expect about  to  drill holes in the st phase if both anomalies are drilled following phases would likely be core drill holes and possibly deeper if anything is found the hole likely would need to be twinned by a core hole whether or not a nd phase can be completed before winter sets in is weather dependent the assay results need to be in hand and evaluated als chemex in elko nevada would be used for assaying   as discussed an access road to the drill site would likely need to be constructed to the drill sites from the historic prunty mine site all of this would be on parented lands and of less than  acres’ total disturbance the ndep has told me that no specific permit is required for this level of disturbance filing a small miners notice would be sufficient a reclamation bond may need to be posted to ndep and the usfs would need to be notified however   initial funding will mark the beginning of the development of the initial drill site further exploration phases will be conducted as needed in the following year this further exploration may include opening of the prunty mine this decision will be made upon successful completion of the initial phases      the best estimate is that a minimum of approximately usd  to a maximum of usd  would be needed to adequately fund the projects as envisioned however the following drill budget is a preliminary

completed by paul a pelke certified professional geologist no   please see resume attached   there are no specific permit requirements if the disturbance is less than  acres and on private land the united states forest service usfs needs to be informed and the nevada department of environmental protection ndep reclamation division has no requirements for such a level of disturbance the ndep would like a small miners permit filed so they know what is happening the ndeps division of reclamation may pay a visit to the site on unpatented claims the usfs needs a plan of operation poo filed and bonding posted for any level of disturbance even in designated road less areas historic old roads can be used especially with low impact vehicles this is decided on a casebycase basis and only when a poo is filed the usfs has a spreadsheet for determining the level of bonding required      asset analysis   background   in  dr pinkard prunty purchased  acres of nevada wilderness from the then future president of the united states herbert hoover gold was discovered on the land soon after dr prunty immediately employed day workers with pick axes to begin extraction and over the next decades purchased an additional  acres with his gold revenues after his death the property passed to his children who continued to successfully mine gold on the property with pickaxes in  family member charles leavitt reviewed the mine’s books and uncovered the fact that revenues had been mishandled this lead to a dispute and the family closing of the mine in    in  david leavitt inherited the land and the associated patented mining claims on the property leavitt was the chairman of humboldt mining company inc       management believes there is persuasive evidence the geological structure of the area is potentially on a major mineralized zone perhaps part of the carlin trend   based on management’s experience and all available documentation we believe we have a “carlintype deposit” this type of deposit possess what geologists call “disseminated gold” it generally takes a microscope to see the gold in such deposits in such deposits the grade may be low but they make up for lowgrade in highvolume to extract gold from such lowgrade deposits miners crush tons of rock which is piled into heaps and irrigated with cyanide an industrialscale mining technique that was actually pioneered at the carlin trend as the gold price shot up at the end of the s mining companies rushed to look for similar deposits around the world  just as the prunty family’s lands were closed in a family dispute   the claims are located on private land in elko county in sections    and  township  north range  east mount diablo baseline and meridian approximately  miles north of the town of elko the site can be accessed by traveling east on interstate to exit  turning north and then immediately taking the frontage road east after approximately  miles turn north on charlestondeeth road after approximately  miles turn right onto county road nf jarbidgecharleston county road  county road  continuing for approximately  miles turn left onto the unnamed dirt road ford  creek and continue approximately  mile to the mine site      the sedimentary units seen in the mine area are referred to as shales and limestones instead of their actual metamorphic counterparts limestones are devonian pilot shale and joana limestone are pennsylvanian in age near the margins of the intrusive the sediments have all been metamorphosed the granodiorite plug is the oldest igneous unit on the property and is probably jurassic in age the intrusive is elongate to the northwest parallel to the trace of the rangefront fault along the southern edge of the intrusive in the prunty mining area is a series of diabase dikes it appears the prunty mine was actually developed on this dike the dike is composed mainly of plagioclase chloritized hornblend and biotite volcanic rocks on the property area are all of the jarbidge rhyolite formation mineralization is hosted in relatively narrow four  to six  feet wide quartz veins that dip at approximately  degrees   the only work completed to date is the drilling described in the report the humboldt mines project elko county nevada dated march   and there are at present no improvements or equipment on site there is no equipment infrastructure or other facilities on site the nearest places to stay are wild horse reservoir elko county nevada owyhee idaho or elko nevada for the geophysical survey the field operations were based out of owyhee idaho once necessary power will be sourced from diesel power and diesel powered generators if needed the water will be obtained from the black warrior mine if accessible if a usfs permit is obtained water can be obtained from  creek if this cannot be obtained there are private wells in the town of charleston which is less than  miles from the project   the property has no known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature   map of the mining claims       the above map indicates that the area enclosed in the yellow box represents the virginia and vanity fair patented claims held by the company these lie along the broader “northwest corridor”      pelke technical evaluation report   in addition to his september  opinion letter in august  paul pelke was retained as a consulting geologist to prepare a technical evaluation report  hereinafter referred to as the “ pelke report ”  on the humboldt mines project in northern elko county nevada the pelke report was completed february   and details the assets locations geology production and exploration history of the company’s patented lands the key findings of the pelke report are summarized below   the property has been drilled three times in   and  mr pelke collected  samples from various locations on the property and subsequently for analysis by the als chemex analytical laboratory in reno nevada these returned gold traces between  ppm  partspermillion  and ppm a concentration of  ppm is  opt all samples have been taken in a  x  polypropylene sample bag it is well known that a full sample bag of that size weighs between  and  pounds and that is the weight of each grab sample taken    during the early summer of  humboldt mining commissioned a ground magnetic survey of the claim group magee geophysical services of reno nevada carried out the survey and wright geophysics of spring creek nevada completed the interpretation based on this data wright geophysics produced two maps showing areas of interest aoi the ground magnetic survey delineates what is interpreted as a heavily intruded sedimentary terrain dominated by two primary structural orientations most prominent among the structures is a northwest corridor traversing the entire project area for  kilometers this zone should be considered to be a principal target area wright interprets the corridor to be composed of one large continuous structure as well as several smaller parallel structures to the northeast   at this time the company has performed no verification work of its own the drilling and geophysics discussed above was completed in  both the drilling and the ground magnetic survey and gis compilation were completed to industry standards   the pelke report recommends initial work should be done in the prunty mine area the quartz with sulfides recovered returned values of  ppm  about  opt  consequently it may be possible to develop underground vein deposit in addition the prunty patented claims cover the most important parts of the northwest corridor based on areas of interest aoi identified by wright geophysics   exploration work prunty claims virginia and vanity fair patents   when pelke arrived on the claim group the initial work that was showed consisted of three areas the prunty mine itself and the cleveland and manhattan patents area   samples  and  were grab samples taken from the prunty dump the mine itself was not accessible because the portal was caved  was a grab sample of a quartz fraction which contained visible sulfides the sulfides included pyrite chalcopyrite and possible arsenopyrite  was a grab sample of the dark fraction which appeared to be a fine grained mafic intrusive with possible disseminated sulfides  quartz fraction returned  ppm au which is equivalent to just over  ounce of au per metric ton while  mafic intrusive returned  ppm au the sample locations can be found on figure  at the point labeled “prunty” figure  attached   sample results are given in “table of detailed sample results” which was prepared by als chemex in reno nevada the weights are given along with the results   later after the area was run for ground magnetics by magee geophysics of reno nevada and interpreted by wright geophysics of elko nevada   the patented prunty claims present a very interesting target area figures    and  not only does the high grade prunty mine lie on this patented ground but also the intrusive interpreted to be present by wright as well as the portion of the northwest corridor that has several of the largest and most important aois as defined by wright       the yellow box outlines the virginia and vanity fair patented claims the red hachured areas represent areas of interest aoi as defined by wright geophysics  the mapped road shows access to the prunty patents which is already permitted by the usfs   the ground magnetic survey delineates what is interpreted as a heavily intruded sedimentary terrain dominated by two primary structural orientations most prominent among the structures is a northwest corridor traversing the entire project area for  kilometers diabase dikes which have been noted to be associated with mineralization at the prunty mine are interpreted along the entire length of the northwest corridor wright  consequently this zone which was defined by wright geophysics should be considered to be the principal target area wright interprets the corridor to be composed of one large continuous structure as well as several smaller parallel structures to the northeast the prunty is located within this corridor and have the best geophysical anomalies in the entire area   figure  –  drill hole and sample locations    figure  – interpretation with residual magnetics after wright  figure  – aoi’s over naip aerial photography after wright       figure   prunty area enlarged     recommendations   it is recommended that the initial work be done in the prunty mine area the quartz with sulfides recovered from the dump returned au values of  ppm au this amounts to approximately  ounce per metric ton tonne consequently it may be possible to develop a high grade underground vein deposit in addition the prunty patented claims also cover one of the most important parts of the northwest corridor figure  based on the size of the aois identified by wright geophysics   since this is patented land private no direct us forest service approval is needed to begin work the usfs is interested in work completed on patented lands in so far as it impacts adjoining usfs lands apparently humboldt mining company already has approval from the forest service to rehabilitate the access road located on the unpatented surrounding ground up the hill to the prunty mine portal area   the humboldt mining company and its successor rancho santa fe mining inc has been in contact with the nevada department of environmental protection ndep rock and water samples have been submitted to an approved environmental laboratory for analysis the sample results raised no obvious red flags and a waste water discharge permit should be approved within the standard time frame ie about  to  months      since the virginia and vanity fair is private land roads can then be constructed to access drill sites on the principal northwest corridor structure there generally is no close monitoring by the ndep nevada department of environmental protection but a plan does need to be filed   the humboldt mining company and its successor rancho santa fe mining inc has been in contact with the nevada department

    mining technique cyanide heap leaching   the geology of the company’s assets dictates the company use of cyanide heap leaching similar to the mining techniques pioneered and used at the nearby carlin trend more than  of all gold extracted worldwide relies upon the use of cyanide of the  million tons of hydrogen cyanide hcn produced annually only  is for use in the mining industry the remaining  is used to produce a wide variety of products such as adhesives computer electronics fire retardants and nylon   in heap leaching a cyanide solution is dripped or sprayed onto heaps of crushed ore that is placed over impervious liners the cyanide solution dissolves minute particles of gold and silver in the ore to form a watersoluble compound the resulting solution containing the metals in this form is collected and processed to extract the gold and silver for further refining the remaining cyanide solution is then recycled and reused for extraction    mine operators have stringent safety practices to minimize risks to workers the environment and communities these include strict workplace safety measures employee training programs and emergency response plans to prepare workers to respond quickly to exposure to cyanide or spillage to prevent any release to the environment mines integrate protective measures such as constructing liquid containment areas around tanks utilizing impervious liners beneath leach pads and ponds and installing leak detection and collection systems  nevada has over  active cyanide leach operations nevadas water pollution control law has cyanide performance standards for groundwater guidelines specific to cyanide operations for closure and reclamation are outlined in the nevada department of environmental protections dep evaluations for closure all mining permits require stabilization of tailings and spent ore during closure closure is considered complete when the facility and mined areas have been stabilized and no longer have the potential to degrade waters of the state reclamation standards are sitespecific no design standards are prescribed in the nevada law the nevada department of wildlife has a permit program for industrial ponds including tailings impoundments and all cyanide process ponds in order to get a viable feasibility study the company needs to have a metallurgical test run on the potential ores from the property this is a must in order to define an economic reserve and will determine whether or not the potential ore in question is amenable or not to heap leaching or milling the testing will be done by a reputable and certified laboratory such as mcclelland labs in reno nevada the amount of material will be determined by the laboratory usually tons the company intends to maintain quality assurancequality control protocols including when preparing samples ensuring proper custody assay precision and accuracy as we implement our exploration plans there are three aspects to a proper qaqc program blanks duplicates and crm or certified reference material blanks blank material can be purchased from a local supplier which consist of crushed concrete blocks these have been assayed and have statistics on the results alternatively one can purchase decorative cobbles usually marble from a local hardware store the idea is to put the reference blanks through the process of crushing and pulverization in the same manner as the gold bearing material proper cleaning of the crusherpulverizer between gold bearing samples is essential due to the possibility of gold smearing

  rancho santa fe mining inc “rsfm” or the “company” was incorporated in the state of nevada on july   the company’s business plan details a strategy to seek out and acquire various precious metal mining assets in the state of nevada rsfm is a developmental company engaged in precious metals exploration with the objective of becoming a substantial gold producer the company is currently focused on the advancement of its two principal projects  the virginia and vanity fair patented claims both of which are located in northern nevada which were acquired in october    operationally the company intends to outsource all of the exploration site preparation and extraction to a thirdparty who provides all the manpower equipment and operational expenses associated therewith the thirdparty operator will compensate the company through a royalty equal to  to  of profits derived from sale the gold reserves recovered and sold by this party from the acquired mining claims noted above the company plans to retain four full time staff members in various capacities and lease office facilities in california legal accounting shareholder relations and geology will be outsourced to consultants as needed business development for the company will be limited to developing and maintaining a website presence nominal travel and business expense   note   summary of significant accounting policies     basis of presentation —the accompanying financial statements are pr epared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company has selected september th as their fiscal year end   going concern —as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company has limited cash and no revenues and has accumulated a deficit of  as of september    these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern  management intends to seek additional capital from new equity securities offerings and shortterm borrowings if necessary that will provide funds needed to increase liquidity and fully implement its business plan  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the company cannot continue in existence   use of estimates —preparing the company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents —cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less because of the short maturity of these   investments the carrying amounts approximate their fair value   fair value measures  asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value  a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or model derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities   f    this hierarchy requires the company to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when estimating fair value     financial instruments —the company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash prepaid expenses and accounts payable  pursuant to asc  the fair value of cash is determined based on “level ” inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assts  the recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or duration   mineral properties —mineral property acquisition costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined when proven and probable reserves are determined for a property subsequent development costs on the property would be capitalized if a project were to be put into production capitalized development costs would be depleted on the units of production basis determined by the proven and probable reserves for that project   asset retirement obligation – future obligations to retire an asset including site closure are recorded as a liability at the fair value incurred the fair value determination is based on estimated future cash flows the current creditadjusted riskfree interest rate and an estimated inflation factor the value of the liability is evaluated at least annually or as new information becomes available as reclamation work is performed or liabilities are otherwise settled the recorded liability amount will be reduced   future reclamation expenditures are difficult to estimate in many circumstances due to the early stage nature of the exploration project the uncertainties associated with defining the nature and extent of environmental disturbance the application of laws and regulations by regulatory authorities and changes in reclamation technology changes in estimates are reflected in the statement of operations in the period an estimate is revised   loss per common share —basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and does not include the impact of any potentially dilutive common stock equivalents  potential common shares are not included in the computation of loss per share as their effect is antidilutive   impairment of longlived assets —the company reviews and evaluates its longlived assets for impairment annually and at interim periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable impairment is determined to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals expected gold and other commodity prices considering current and historical prices price trends and related factors production levels and operating costs of production and capital all based on lifeofmine plans the term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during processing and treatment estimates of recoverable minerals from such mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials   in estimating future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups the company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals gold and other commodity prices production levels and operating costs of production and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties   mining development costs —mine development costs are amortized using the units of production method based upon projected recoverable ounces in proven and probable reserves projected recoverable ounces are determined by the company based upon its proven and probable reserves and estimated metal recovery associated with those reserves  as of september   no mines are in production therefore none are being amortized   revenue recognition —the company has not yet achieved any revenues  revenue will be recognized on profits from the sale of gold recovered by contractors royalties from the sale of gold silver and other metal sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable the metal is delivered the title has been transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured   advertising costs —the company expense advertising costs as they are incurred and had no advertising costs as of september     f    income taxes —the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method which recognizes certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of the company’s liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets this method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the company as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect the company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit if any by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year   at september   the company recorded a valuation allowance against all of its deferred income tax assets which it believes based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized   stockbased compensation —the company records stockbased compensation in accordance with asc  “compensation – stock based compensation” and asc  “equity based payments to nonemployees” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all sharebased awards made to employees and directors including stock options   asc  requires companies to estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model  the company uses the blackscholes optionpricing model as its method of determining fair value  this model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables  these subjective variables include but are not limited to the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period   all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued whichever is more reliably measurable   recent accounting pronouncements —the company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   note  – related party transactions   for the period from july   date of inception to september   two of the company’s executive officersshareholders had advanced  for expenses relating to the company and its operations these advances have been reflected in the accompanying balance sheet under the caption “accounts payable – related parties” the stock subscriptions receivables due from the stockholders were collected on november     note  – federal income taxes   total income tax benefit is less than the amount computed by multiplying the loss before income taxes by the statutory federal income tax rate  the reasons for the difference and the related tax effects for the period ended september         september         net loss                tax benefit at statutory rates of        nondeductible expenses     —     change in valuation allowances                  net income tax benefit    —       f    the components of the deferred tax assets are as follows                       september         deferred tax assets     net operating loss carryforward                total deferred tax asset       less valuation allowance                       —       the company has no deferred tax liabilities     as of september   the company had a federal income tax net operating loss carry forward of approximately  to offset future taxable income which begins to expire in  the company has never had an internal revenue service audit   note  – commitments and contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur  the company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment  in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated the estimated liability is accrued in the company’s financial statements  if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material will be disclosed loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees are disclosed   note  – subsequent events   the company’s management have evaluated subsequent events through december   the date the financial statements were issued in the opinion of the company’s management there have been no significant events since september   other than the acquisition of certain mining claims in exchange for  shares of the company’s common stock on october     on october   the company entered into an “asset purchase agreement by and between rancho santa fe mining inc and humboldt mining company inc” this agreement required the company to issue  shares of its common stock in exchange for certain land and mining claims   on september   the company entered into an “equity purchase agreement” with kodiak capital group llc “kodiak” whereby kodiak can purchase up to  of the company’s common stock the stock would be sold for a price equal to the closing bid price for the company’s common stock on the principal market on a trading day as reported by bloomberg finance lp the company committed to issue kodiak capital  shares of its common stock as a commitment shares

tankwoodworkshop search compare listings homeabout us about us the story of gold rush expeditions – from then ’til now it all started with george thompson and a book called “some dreams die” in  the book is basically a treasure hunter’s handbook george set up grand images of mining days gone by and the lost treasures buried by miners indians and other outlaws in  driver’s license in one hand and a well read dogeared copy of “some dreams die” corey set out to find these lost treasures endless days and long starry nights were spent wandering and exploring the hills of utah’s remote and unforgiving west desert days were spent matching lore with real maps and history and then finding and documenting the old areas one aspect became clear and consistent with each discovery everything was tied to mining sites that lead to a different search what was this mining thing and why was it nearly dead for the average person today history is pretty clear that the west was settled on one concept mining anyone could be a prospector these prospectors combed the hills and sometimes made a strike farmers and ranchers followed feeding the miners this was the start of a community soon a small town would form because americans are capitalists if anything and these miners and ranchers needed supplies as the mines expanded so did the towns soon there were rail lines be aware that the cross country rail lines were not built for the people and tourism of the nation no they were built to transport massive loads of gold and silver ores to mills and plants these towns would flourish from mining schools hospitals and more would pop up in support of the mining operations in many cases when the mines died out for whatever reasons the towns would fade as well it’s a story that can be seen all over the west even today corey found it intriguing that most every town in utah could be traced back to mining even brigham young and his band of mormons were only able to survive by selling wares to the people who passed along on their way to the gold fields of nevada or the gold rush lands of california yet very little mining was happening today  over the years corey couldn’t help but notice more and more historic mining sites vanishing from the landscape tunnels and drifts that made up the being of many men’s lives were backfilled and bulldozed the history completely destroyed and the mines and their locations becoming lost knowledge a bit of investigation showed that this history was being viciously destroyed by our own us forest service and bureau of land management through their abandoned mine reclamation programs no concern for history or the heritage of a mine camp that had been tucked away for  years in a long forgotten canyon no concern for the men still mining their claims on the weekend for some extra money the mission of these agencies is nothing less than the eradication of mining from the face of the land entire historic mine camps from the s through the great depression arewere being burned and bulldozed at an alarming rate this destruction included mills ore bins trusses and cabins these historic mines where people had built a life were being completely erased from the landscape never to be seen again utah division of oil gas and mining director john baza said it best “it’s time to erase the scar of mining from this land” one week these abandoned mining camps would be there the next week there would be an empty bulldozed piece of land no history no remembrance of the men and women who worked slept and may have died there the concept of wiping out the history of these people and what they built through mining was completely unacceptable corey was determined to do something about it and so gold rush expeditions was born today gold rush expeditions inc combs the historic maps and documents locating valuable and historic mining sites that are still standing as a company we have come to learn that mining is not dead many mines hold millions and sometimes billions of dollars in gold and gem reserves gold rush expeditions inc locates these sites and documents them thoroughly then offering them up for sale providing opportunities for mining to grow and live again mining has been around since the beginning of time and it’s not too difficult to make a living like thousands of miners have done over the years “we find ’em you mine ’em” that pretty much sums it up over the years gold rush expeditions have become experts at finding the best available mines in the west and then documenting and presenting those mines to the public gre takes care of all of the paperwork with the blm and simplifies the process then we show you what you need to do to mine it our legal team helps you through all of the steps of permitting and turning your mining operation into a working producing mine  gold rush expeditions inc also sponsors the national bureau of mines a repository of every mine and mine site that they have documented over the years the goal is to educate people about america’s mining heritage remind us all that we come from tough stock people who were both dreamers and doers highlighting the incredible feats they accomplished gold rush expeditions inc wants to bring back the gold rush gold rush expeditions inc wants these mining sites to be around for future generations to learn from and enjoy gold rush expeditions inc formally formed as an incorporated entity in  since that time they have grown exponentially evolving into a powerful force restoring mining as a way of life mining today today the opportunity for mining is greater than it has ever been old mines that were abandoned when gold mining was made illegal by the war act are still out there these mines provided more than a living they provided independence and freedom  gold rush expeditions inc locates mines throughout the west these mines are ready to work with rich veins visible and ores exposed while regulations have increased the tools and ability to process the ore from these historic mines are more effective than ever while each year more and more mines are erased from our landscape gold rush expeditions inc is racing against the destruction we are out documenting the old mines in the backcountry of the west researching surveying and filing claims on the valuable sites these mines were america’s past success and with a little work they are america’s future success gold rush envisions the transition a generation of paper pushing computer terminal warriors being transformed into an army of miners creating their own future and prosperity working underground digging out gold and gems  over the years gold rush has seen that we are not alone there are many miners in waiting snapping up these sites as quickly as we can locate them gold rush is playing a small part in helping americans to remember and appreciate their past this while offering an opportunity to work the mines and provide a good living for themselves “it’s a st century gold rush if our kids and their kids have something to look back on then we are accomplishing what we have set out to do”   a crash course on abandoned mine reclamation back in the ’s the nation’s mining heritage dotted if not covered the landscape of the western states an estimated  to  thousand of these old abandoned mines were found scattered throughout the west their head frames and waste piles provided a glimpse into the nation’s past today there are still some surviving mines on federal lands but most of those will be gone in a few decades the loss of western mining heritage will accelerate in the coming years rather than diminish not because of the gradual effects of wind weather and vandals but primarily due to government reclamation programs in  congress passed the surface mining control and reclamation act which taxes active coal mines the funds were meant to fix safety hazards and environmental problems from two centuries of coal mining but increasingly the funds are applied towards eliminating historic hard rock mines in the west since the passage of the act in   billion has been spent by the office of surface mining osm to reclaim old mines that have been deemed “hazardous” the history of these landmarks is gone forever never to be seen again why the blm and fs are bent on closing abandoned mines the bureau of land management and forest service claim that they are bulldozing old mining sites for public safety which is a believable story until you look at the numbers from  to  there were only  deaths across the united states attributed to abandoned mines in  there were  deaths attributed to abandoned mines in  there were  deaths attributed to abandoned mines in relation there are approximately  people per day that die while swimming in lakes and rivers across the us that is over  people per year so why isn’t there more of a focus on lake and river safety follow the money they have the money to spend and it’s use it or risk losing it there also seems to be an underlying current among the blm and forest service to reclaim much of the land in the west to its primitive state it appears that the blm and forest service use the surface mining control and reclamation act to reclaim mines and the endangered species act to close large swaths of land with the same goal to keep the public from using the land why it is important to preserve our mining heritage the destruction of these historic landmarks is alarming we are actively destroying our heritage we are standing on the shoulders of giants and at the same time our government organizations are determined to erase all evidence that these giants ever existed when we remember the struggles that our predecessors went through and the obstacles they overcame we begin to see that we are part of a larger narrative it gives us added strength we become more resilient and better able to deal with the challenges in our own lives the ingenuity resourcefulness and the stick to it mentality of these old miners are absolutely amazing here they were far from civilization making their living cutting tunnels and bringing out gold they built small towns with whatever resources they could find they crossed the plains and built every mining town from leadville colorado and virginia city nevada to butte montana they were independent and hardworking dreamers who in very essence built the west thomas paine wrote over  years ago “what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly” in a bigger sense when we forget the price that was paid for the rise of this nation and the struggles that we overcame to get where we are we esteem our current position too lightly and we risk losing what our ancestors worked so hard to gain one of the main reasons we work so hard to preserve these old mines is so that we have the physical reminders of the contributions of those who went before us   in corey’s own words “it’s a wild ride i never expected to see so many mining enthusiasts we’ve had our fair share of tough times but i have no regrets this is what i love doing and the more mines i can save and put into production the bigger the chance that these mines and their history will be preserved the best part is seeing the number of people who are able to make a good living working mines that would have otherwise been destroyed” properties

paperwork on claims including deeds and documentation is  business days this time allows us to make sure that all issues have been resolved and your claim is unencumbered geology surveys and samples maybe you just want an underground survey with samples our trained surveyors will document the exposed veins and lodes in the mine and extract samples from those ore bodies these to be delivered

can do that as well drilling and core sample extractions are contracted out to gre trusted companies mine exploration underground exploration can be dangerous our teams utilize both oxygen and gas meters to monitor air quality and are trained to safely navigate the inner workings of underground operations exploration occurs to the extent that is viably safe for the surveyor to do so in the case of reopening closed mines we require at least  days lead time for the mine to clear of “dead air” if it is determined that the mine cannot be safely documented there will be a  survey fee this fee will include pictures of the site from outside the mine and surrounding area underground exploration is billed at  per foot excavation services are on a case by case quote mine owner is responsible

tankwoodworkshop search compare listings homefrequently asked questions frequently asked questions general questions why does gold rush expeditions sell mining claims instead of working them themselves our mission is to preserve mining history and to reestablish the glory days of mining that has been our goal from the very beginning thousands of mine sites are destroyed across the west each year by the blm forest service and other land managers every mine we claim and sell can be moved off of that list of “abandoned mines” and thus preserved we seek to document and preserve the work that made the west what it is today if gold rush stopped to “work” these mines we would not be able to document and procure new sites we would become strictly a mining company that’s not who we are and not what we do we sell mines with visible veins of gold or gems every day the mission of gold rush expeditions inc is not to mine these sites to coin a phrase “we find ’em you mine ’em”    can i look at a claim site and test some samples before i buy absolutely but we do require a signed nondisclosureconfidentiality agreement prior to disclosing the location of sites we do this because we spend a lot of time locating these sites and believe they have value and often times the new claimant does not want a lot of people wandering around their claim after purchase in the case of claims listed on our website we can hold a claim for seven days with a nonrefundable deposit of  if you decide to purchase the claim the  can then be used towards your purchase we can also provide you with authorization to remove up to  lbs of sample how does gold rush expeditions inc determine the price for each claim there are a variety of elements that determine the pricing of a particular mining claim or block of mining claims for your information here are some of the elements that are taken into consideration mineral content the surveyors themselves look through any available tailings to find evidence of precious metals they inspect the ores and veins personally and report the visible presences of any valuable minerals it doesn’t get any more direct than that the surveyors are looking for minerals that can be taken by hand in many cases they bypass many mines with “microscopic gold” or “sulphide minerals” because they are difficult to extract value from that is the reason you see gold rush mines stating “free milling gold” or visible gems and deposits while our historical research is extensive and painstaking we don’t solely rely on that second hand information we validate and verify right on site scarcityrarity contrary to popular belief there are many mines out there with substantial mineral reserves and values with that in mind mines are being destroyed by the blm and forest service on a daily basis  years ago you could find a good producing mine in any variety of districts across the west not today with reclamation becoming a business for the government closures are more prevalent usable mining claims are becoming more scarce for instance in a county or a district with high gold values but very few viable mines those mines will have increased value our goal is to find a mine that is still intact preferably not reclaimed that can be worked profitably under casual use with no government interference there are a lot of factors to take into consideration we judge them all and pass the information to you location location in a key mining district or region is vital to pricing of a claim if the mine is located in a gulch or drainage it may rank higher gold rush expeditions inc surveyors will often overlook mines that are right off the highway no one wants to deal with lots of passerby’s unless the mine is completely stunning and secure  gold rush expeditions inc’s ideal sites are large remote and undisturbed with substantial documentation even though a more remote mine will rank high it’s not much good to you if you cannot build a road to it another element of the critique is if the claim is easily accessible by road or trail a mine that is inaccessible cannot ship out ores and its thus going to rank low on our scale environment the next element that is addressed are factors in the climate and environment in general we look at the available resources on the site and make note if there’s any shelter water or timber having year round water is often pivotal and shelter is more than necessary when the sun is beating down on you some older mines will have remnants of old structures and that can prove useful to a miner whether it’s providing shelter in a cabin or utilizing an old mill sometimes it is easier and cheaper to utilize existing structures than building new also as part of environment we consider the aesthetics is the mine itself awe inspiring does it have a special and unique look to it that you can’t quite find anywhere else does it have character does it have an interesting story  market all of the elements above put together a good picture of the market for specific mines and properties this market will fluctuate slightly from year to year but similar to real estate it always seems to grow as mining companies and small miners pay more for claims the values of others will grow naturally history can attest to how valuable a mine is records of the mine producing gold andor other precious metals the general trend is a positive one where the exact mine claim that sold in  for k today will sell for over k in most regions that’s not a bad trend does gold rush expeditions inc offer leases andor shared ventures gold rush expeditions inc does not often enter into shared ventures but there are rare occasions where we have been able to assist small miners in getting their operations up and running for a share of the smelter returns  gold rush expeditions inc does offer leases on many of its higher priced mining claim blocks this is to assist the smaller miner with start up costs we

small miner waiver for annual assessments you cannot own over  claims how long does a mining claim remain active indefinitely provided that the annual assessment payments are kept current these annual assessments must be completed by september st of each year werent most mines abandoned because they were all mined out it may come as a surprise but most mines were not abandoned due to lack of production or minerals there are many reasons that mines were abandoned the most common are related to regulation and are as follows the “silver crash” of  federal support for purchase of silver and silver ores was removed in  the value of silver dropped from over  per ounce to  per ounce in  stabilizing at an average of  by the end of the year this equated to a cut of more than  consider the impact that losing  of your income tomorrow would have on your own economy as a result many silver mines were mothballed while waiting for the price to rise to previous levels of  per ounce during wwi and wwii many left their mines to either fight in the war or help support the war effort by working in other industries in  president roosevelt made it illegal to pursue the mining of any minerals except those considered strategic this act was known as the war act and its intent was to cripple the mining industry while providing man power for wwii  men never returned from wwii this left their mining operations abandoned in addition over  were wounded left permanently disabled and were unable to return to their mines  many men after wwii never returned to their mines in the years after wwii the federal government bolstered efforts to encourage people to work in the cities and offices of the nation  since the repeal of the war act in  mining activity decreased over  these mines were left abandoned because people died or were no longer able to work their mines many more people held their mining claims while they worked their city jobs from  all the while promising to return to mining at some point most never did and when they died or stopped paying on their claims they were considered abandoned where can i get raw ore processed gold rush expeditions inc recommends the paradine

people attach so much value to gold gold is one of the rarest elements on the planet earth it has been used as currency and for trade since the dawn of recorded history it is a solid tangible asset that can be used to purchase barter or trade for most any item how does gold differ from pyrite pyrite is a derivative of iron pyrite often occurs in gold lodes old spanish prospectors lived by the motto “gold rides an iron horse” meaning that where you find heavy concentrations of iron you will find gold if you find something that you think is gold use the knife method to verify gold is mallable it will feel soft you can gouge it with a knife but it will not scratch pyrite on the other hand is a more crystalline formation and is very hard if you scratch it with a knife the surface will mar and become defaced gold and pyrite differ slightly in color shape hardness odor and malleability it’s not difficult to tell the two apart once you have seen them side by side gold also forms in and with pyrite in a form known as auferous pyrite for more information please seedifference between gold and pyrite what does gold look like in its native formin the host rock the appearance of gold is dependent on how it is formed native gold in a good mine will look exactly like what it is gold gold is soft it can be “dented” with the tip of a knife or other hard object gold is also globulus meaning it is not crystalline it will not have hard edges or any crystal formations native gold is also called “free gold” or “free milling gold” this  refers to gold that can be crushed and panned out by crushing the rock you will break the gold out of it it can then be panned out with water or other chemicals  gold can also be microscopic and invisible to the naked eye unless you are planning a pit mine processing thousands of tons per day microscopic gold is as good as no gold gold often runs with quartz gold also alloys with metals such as copper iron and silver an old miner adage is that that you always want to be on the look out for one of the  metals which always occur together those being gold silver copper and platinum the concentrations may vary but this is a very accurate statement this is why there are a lot of mines named “the  metals” where can i find the current price on goldsilver gold rush expeditions inc recommends kitcocom kitco website properties

lode details gold rush expeditions  month ago i really like this claim it is one of the nicest you have offered i loved it the last time it was available i’d just like to add corey you and your crew are awesome you have provided a great deal of information on mining and prospecting and have been professional and upstanding to the utmost you are helping to make the dream come true for many have a great day by steven adler you can’t go wrong buying a mine from gre they are honest and accurate with their details i can’t say enough so nuf’ said by don wotherspoon last spring i bought a lode mining claim in southern arizona from gold rush expeditions gre i purchased this claim from gre because i felt that they were a reputable professional company in september i received a notice from blm that they wanted an amendment to the notice of location that had previously been accepted by the county and blm or else they would terminate my claim i contacted gre and they quickly responded to this regulatory change by blm and submitted amendments to the county and blm which have been recorded successfully it is one thing to have a company complete a sale and accept your funds it is another to have that company come through for you after the sale when it matters i highly recommend gre as a competent company with integrity i would go back to them again in the future by c h we have done business with gold rush almost since the inception we have purchased andor sold numerous claims with gold rush and have always had a very pleasant purchasing and selling experience phone calls emails and messages have always been handled in prompt courteous manner we would recommend gold rush expeditions to our valued customers and friends as having a highly respectful and honest organization you need not worry as their word tends to be their bond by bc massey vp  onyx exploration when gre says that they want satisfied customers its not just words they prove it with actions that go beyond normal business practices so this is a shout out to them kudos for all by anonymous buyer purchased on aug   i have bought other claims from individuals that were later forfeited to the blm because of a failure by the previous owners to file the proper paperwork i was able to reclaim the claims but what a pain and waste of time and money i know when i purchase a claim from gold rush expeditions the claim is solid and your support team is there if assistance is needed i would especially recommend purchasing claims from gold rush expeditions to someone who is new to prospecting i am waiting for the weather to cooperate a little more before going to the claim but i feel like i have already been there by way of your video i hope to purchase more claims from gold rush expeditions in the future by anonymous buyer purchased on feb th  gre has answered my questions and some i didnt have very nice to work with easy communication and fast service i would highly recommend them for a mine purchase
