retirement plan consulting improve investments lower costs and reduce fiduciary liability put in simplest terms the rules for retirement plans have changed there are more regulations more lawsuits and more scrutiny on top of that costs continue to rise our job is to help our clients navigate this increasingly complex landscape doug mcleodmanaging director in the wake of the  financial crisis and a recent supreme court decision k pension and profitsharing plans are under unprecedented scrutiny in this increasingly regulated and litigious environment plan sponsors are coming to the realization that this changing landscape requires an assessment and an evaluation of their existing plans we work with retirement plans to improve investment options lower costs and mitigate the fiduciary liability of plan sponsors because every plan is different with unique goals and objectives the same individualized approach we employ in wealth management is applied to retirement plan consulting we work closely with plan sponsors administrators and participants to ensure that their plan best suits their needs and that it also complies with current erisa and department of labor regulations and guidelines many businesses law firms and medical practices are paying too much for their retirement plans—a cost burden often passed on to individual plan participants compounding the problem is the fact that many plans have underperforming investment options that were selected for reasons other than their investment merits our commitment to open architecture empowers us to meet our fiduciary duty providing plan options based entirely on their investment merits and designed to improve performance and reduce costs when we work with retirement plan clients we consider ourselves caretakers—not only of the plan itself but also of its individual participants participant education is too often neglected or nonexistent and our commitment to advising plan participants is integral

using the mean average of the number of normalized sell hold buy and strong buy ratings each stocks consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score   sell   hold   buy   strong
