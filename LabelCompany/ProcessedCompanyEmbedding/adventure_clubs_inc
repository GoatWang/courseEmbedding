meeting someone our events are designed to make it easy to meet someone no awkward oneonone pressure no games learn the  secrets i would like to thank events and adventures ea for some of the best travel events i have ever experienced i have found that the ea staff makes every effort to ensure that we the members have as good and safe an experience as can be provided i appreciate from firsthand experience how the hosts for the events will make every effort to accommodate any change in plans requested by a member – we don’t have to “stick to the plan” – we can request a different activity to do on our own if we wish to do so signing up for an event is as easy as a click and the rest in most cases is a done deal sometimes airfare may be extra to get to a “gateway” for a trip departure but i’m in a frequent flier program so i can benefit the accumulation of air miles to use in the future it’s easy to book travel on your own – but when you travel with ea you have an instant family – just add fun you always have friends to talk to or you don’t have to say a word but who can resist the comfort of friendship when we travel together we’re all there for the same reason to enjoy the company of our peers i also want to thank you for the trips to places i likely would never have gone to otherwise now i can say that i have petted a koala bear and scuba dived at the great barrier reef of australia i’ve walked through the cloudy mist in the steps of the incas at machu picchu i’ve hiked the great wall of china and ridden the new maglev train to the shanghai airport at  kph and i’m

phoenix singles club san francisco singles club san jose singles club seattle singles club vancouver singles club get out have fun apply now  secrets to meeting someone our events are designed to make it easy to meet someone no awkward oneonone pressure no games learn the  secrets i would like to thank events and adventures ea for some of the best travel events i have ever experienced i have found that the ea staff makes every effort to ensure that we the members have as good and safe an experience as can be provided i appreciate from firsthand experience how the hosts for the events will make every effort to accommodate any change in plans requested by a member – we don’t have to “stick to the plan” – we can request a different activity to do on our own if we wish to do so signing up for an event is as easy as a click and the rest in most cases is a done deal sometimes airfare may be extra to get to a “gateway” for a trip departure but i’m in a frequent flier program so i can benefit the accumulation of air miles to use in the future it’s easy to book travel on your own – but when you travel with ea you have an instant family – just add fun you always have friends to talk to or you don’t have to say a word but who can resist the comfort of friendship when we travel together we’re all there for the same reason to enjoy the company of our peers i also want to thank you for the trips to places i likely would never have gone to otherwise now i can say that i have petted a koala bear and scuba dived at the great barrier reef of australia i’ve walked through the cloudy mist in the steps of the incas at machu picchu i’ve hiked the great wall of china and ridden the new maglev train to the shanghai airport at  kph and i’m looking forward more adventures the future i can see that joining ea was a good choice and i didn’t know that for certain until after i had the experience of being a member for a while so thank you and your staff now and in the future for a job well done tom c a thank you to ea it’s time to save the date choose the events that you want to attend from a packed calendar of fun outings whatever you like we have your event   send to email address
