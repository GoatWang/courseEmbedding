stealthgas fleet investor relations weekly market report    print email th july  nwemed the european coaster market has had a reasonably active week with several fixtures being concluded especially in nwe butane continues to be the driving force particuarly smaller parcels by petroineos ex grangemouth there are prompt vessels in nwe across all sectors and with the larger coasters now competing on part cargoes this is leading to further downward pressure on rates it has been quieter in the med and black sea with some traders showing potential relet positions some lavera export tonnes were discussed however these were eventually lifted on trader controlled vessel  seafeast the singapore ihs conference has kept the asian spot market muted this week with limited demand from the receivers the total cfr purchase tender for delivery into bangladesh was awarded this week though details are unconfirmed on the freight market a lack of ships kept spot rates firm whilst on the period market traders are still keen to take more cbm ships on charter earlier this week a european trading house took another  cbm ship on charter from a european owner for  option  years for eastern trading according to some press reports enterprise products and navigator holdings have signed a letter of intent to develop an ethylene export terminal at morgans point in the houston ship channel for the sake of owners and traders and brokers looking to move more longhaul petchems we hope these longterm commitments are forthcoming however we remain less than convinced about a new golden age of us ethylene exports in asia apart from petronas quoting some spot sell tenders discussion on intraasia ethylene movements has been minimal the ne asian propylene market has shown some strength in anticipation of the scheduled turnaround at formosa taiwan with traders exploring the possibility to move deepsea cargoes to fill the expected production loss the c market has also been quiet with no fresh tenders heard thus far this week the main issue has been delays in chinese ports due to congestion and ullage issues resulting in ships being cancelled unsurprisingly with a slack petchem market

earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all
