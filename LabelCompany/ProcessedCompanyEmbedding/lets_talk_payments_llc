liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a limited liability company llc offers protection from personal liability for business debts just like a corporation however unlike a corporation which must pay its own taxes an llc is a passthrough tax entity the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship moreover while setting up an llc is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship running one is significantly easier than running a corporation here are the main features of an llc limited personal liability like shareholders of a corporation all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor  such as a supplier a lender or a landlord  the creditor cannot legally come after an llc members house car or other personal possessions because only llc assets are used to pay off business debts llc owners stand to lose only the money that theyve invested in the llc this feature is often called limited liability exceptions to limited liability while llc owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions this protection is not absolute this drawback is not unique to llcs however  the same exceptions apply to corporations an llc owner can be held personally liable if he or she personally and directly injures someone personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the llc defaults fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees wages intentionally does something fraudulent illegal or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else or treats the llc as an extension of his or her personal affairs rather than as a separate legal entity this last exception is the most important if owners dont treat the llc as a separate business a court might decide that the llc doesnt really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts to keep this from happening make sure you and your coowners act fairly and legally do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors creditors or other outsiders fund your llc adequately invest enough cash in the business so that your llc can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities keep llc and personal business separate get a federal employer identification number open up a businessonly checking account and keep your personal finances out of your llc accounting books create an operating agreement having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your llcs separate existence for more on this see nolos article the llc operating agreement for more information on llc limited liability protection and the differences in state laws see  llcs and limited  liability  what protection do you get   additional protection business insurance a good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not for instance if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a clients back your liability insurance policy should cover you insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court in addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations insurance can protect the llcs assets from lawsuits and claims but your llc wont be protected if it doesnt pay its bills commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts whether or not theyre personally guaranteed for more information on insurance see nolos article obtaining small business insurance llc taxes unlike a corporation an llc is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes instead it is what the irs calls a passthrough entity like a partnership or sole proprietorship this means that business income passes through the business to the llc members who report their share of profits  or losses  on their individual income tax returns each llc member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs while an llc itself doesnt pay taxes coowned llcs must file form  an informational return with the irs each year this form which partnerships also have to file sets out each llc members share of the llcs profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure llc members are correctly reporting their income for more information on llc taxes see nolos article how llcs are taxed llc management the owners of most small llcs participate equally in the management of their business this arrangement is called member management there is an alternative management structure  somewhat awkwardly called manager management  in which you designate one or more owners or even an outsider to take responsibility for managing the llc the nonmanaging owners sometimes family members who have invested in the company simply sit back and share in llc profits in a managermanaged llc only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the llc choosing manager management sometimes makes sense but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities for more information see nolos limited liability company llc faq forming an llc to create an llc you file articles of organization in some states called a certificate of organization or certificate of formation with the llc division of your state government this office is often in the same department as the corporations division which is usually part of the secretary of states office filing fees range from about  to  now in every state you can  form an llc with just one person many states supply a blank onepage form for the articles of organization on which you need only specify a few basic details about your llc such as its name and address and contact information for a person involved with the llc usually called a registered agent who will receive legal papers on its behalf some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the llc members in addition to filing articles of organization you must create a written llc operating agreement you dont have to file your operating agreement with the state but that doesnt mean you can get by without one the operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the llc members rights and responsibilities their percentage interests in the business and their share of the profits to learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an llc read nolos article how to form an llc to form your llc right now use nolos online llc which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state ending an llc under the laws of many states unless your operating agreement says otherwise when one member wants to leave the llc the company dissolves in that case the llc members must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts divide any assets and profits among themselves and then decide whether they want to start a new llc to continue the business with the remaining members your llc operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including buysell or buyout provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the llc to pursue other interests for more information see nolos article plan ahead for llc ownership changes share on google plus share on facebook talk to a lawyer need help start here

upgrade and new line but nowhere on the website did it say that i would get a new line and the website asked what phone number i wanted the plan to go to totally deceptive after an hour on the phone with sprint i had to send the phone back and get refunded by sprint sprint told me that third parties get a  commission every time they open a new line so theyll use any sort of deception to get people to sign up sprint was totally cool about the whole thing but it was a hassle and obviously not worth it since now i have no new phone im going to write a letter to sprint to tell them about the

so on this conference call with a tmobile rep and a lets talk rep i was told that because the lines were activated they recieved their commission as well as i deactivated them before the  day guarantee well everything was told that no issues were discovered and that everything was taken f four months later my moms card was charged  for deactivation fees first of all this card was used for verification only and no where in their terms and conditions does it state that it gives them permission to charge the card so now the phones are gone so i cant return them which on that lovely conference call i was told i didnt need to return them and they will not own up to making a mistake i have called in numerous times and i keep getting the run around you would think that in four months if a product wasnt received that was supposed to be that one would recieve a letter email or something stating that the phones were not yet received but not this company if anyone knows how i

lets talk money by bruce m tharp  sep   join core today submit your projects for publication favorite this y m u  x h  favorite  comments  views you may have to wait six months to a year to get on the shelves after a buyer agrees to sell your productso lets talk moneyin the first article in this series about product licensing for industrial designers i presented a vision of what is possible—positive encouraging optimistic but slightly cautionary here i am interested in throwing out some numbers so that you can decide if licensing might make sense for you or under what conditions it wouldit is important to understand that there is no standard contract across industries or even within a company everything is generally negotiable and there are many ways that compensation can pan out the most common mode is for a company to compensate through royalties only which helps mitigate their risk that the product may not sell well it is also possible for the designer to receive upfront cash in addition to royalties but often this is just an advance payment deducted from future royalties but this is still good if you can get it because there is no guarantee that there will be future royalties hence companies usually only agree to advances if the amount is relatively small andor if they are confident that the product will sell insisting on significant money up front is often a quick way to sour a dealoxo offers licensors both cash buyouts and royalty dealssome companies prefer to buy the intellectual property outright in one lump sum—as with ikea for example this is more of a gamble for the licensee but saves the administrative hassle of calculating and cutting royalty checks as well as the risk and cost of potential contract renegotiation or disputes with the licensor you but with this risk comes the reward of saving all the royalties they would have paid out if the product proved particularly successful some companies like oxo consider both the royalty and cashbuyout optionscompanies can also offer an equity stake in the business that surrounds the product this is much less common however and occurs usually when the designer brings more to the table than just a single new product idea eg name cache design services for a whole product line expertise and connections or even money more established designersconsultancies do this like yves behars fuseproject that has had at least  equity partners including more recently with core design awards  notable for consumer products sabi fuseprojects recent joint venture sabi pill productsi am going to focus however on the most common approach—royaltiesonly in doing so i want to emphasize the need to understand the licensees position being in the massmanufacturing business is tough there are high startup costs with tooling and initial inventory increasing pressures from mass retailers like having to take back product if it does not sell overhead costs of product development and sales teams stiff global competition changing regulations expensive and lengthy certifications insurance etc young designers often gasp when hearing that a good royalty rate might be  of wholesale cost around  of retail price—but it is my idea seasoned designers understand that a designed product not to mention one that is not engineered sourced and fully developed and tested is but a small part of the business equation while important good product design needs so much more to be a lasting commercial success at the heart of the numbers is the issue of risk designers in most cases have very little to lose beyond their time and relatively small development costs in the business world the bigger risktakers earn the bigger the rewardsi mentioned in the last column that many of the designy companies like the big european furniture and furnishings enterprises often fail to yield substantive paychecks they can be good for the portfolio but not the pocketbook this is in large part due to a lack of substantive intellectual property being offered for license much of what sells is not particularly novel look at the similarities in product lines at crate and barrel west elm room and board restoration hardware—these companies are going after the same basic market and when one has a hit product the others follow suit with their own derivations this is certainly not unique to furniture and occurs to some degree in probably every industry my tragically favorite demonstration of this sameness is the telephone aisle at best buy overwhelmingly there are just slight aesthetic differences that possibly could be protected by a design patent but that would ultimately not afford much protection i am an advocate of design patents when approached and drafted strategically but in a mature product category where there is a great deal of prior art they arent so effective or would take hundreds of thousands of dollars to enforce with litigation manufacturers must navigate these treacherous waters and understandably are wary of paying significant sums for product ideas that cannot be protected design patent enforcement can be more challenging in a mature product categoryi advocate designers getting into the game of novel functionality rather than just form or secondarily producing form that can be well protected through design patents if designers can produce robust intellectual property they have access to a greater pay out otherwise licensing is a bit of a crapshoot ed note for more on design patents check out our full series herewhile some complain about the intellectual property protection as impeding innovation it is intended to spur advancement by offering a reward a shortterm monopoly for the risk of investing in something new like it or not these are the rules of the game and for product design they are generally fair with generally equal access enforcement of patents however is problematic as litigation is as my attorney puts it the sport of kings luckily for more traditional product design as opposed to information technology and electronica disruption by patent trolls is less problematic crocs recently won a major design patent infringementwhile admittedly the patent system is far from ideal product designers can more easily get aboard on the front end—securing ip for licensure—while the licensee is usually at the more troublesome back end of enforcement but going after infringers may still not be cost effective and both licensor and licensee lose with reduced salesso lets say you have a protectable new product idea—how much money is in it the answer depends on a few major factors royalty percentage the amount the royalty percentage is based on cost of the product number of units sold and time period the wise licensor considers all of these at the outset when vetting a new product idea and before investing too much time and energy royalty rates vary per industry but a good rule of thumb is between  on the low end and  on the high end i have licensed consumer products for as low as  and as high as  with  being the most common and a generally fair number but  of what usually this percentage is on wholesale cost often net sales for the manufacturer this is not the price tag in the store but is often less than half of this— is pretty typical with larger retailers so  retail price tag is sold at a wholesale price of  the retailer has a  margin and be careful especially with the bigname european furniture and furnishings companies their notion of net sales is often actually at or near the cost of manufacturing sometimes called first cost which is generally half of wholesale cost—ouch net sales may be closer to manufacturing cost than wholesale price photo by mike roelofspricepoint of the product must next be considered if the retail price of product is especially low less than a dollar or is especially high hundreds or thousands of dollars then royalty rates often reflect this both parties generally have their eye on the final cost of the license and purchase price has some relation to sales volume understandably fewer  products are sold than  products in my experience it is tougher to make a decent paycheck on a  item than a  item while more people can afford a  item a  item is still accessible and the units sold can be equivalent but usually the royalty rate is the same so within a range you are often better off shooting for a product that sells for moreas mentioned number of units sold is a critical component this is why distribution is so important and why mass retailers are often the key to a nice royalty check if a retailer has  stores like bed bath  beyond and they sell  product per store per week then this is  products per year usually if your product is not selling at least at this rate they will drop your product with a fairly successful product you may sell  units per store per week or  units each year if the product sells for  wholesales for  and you have a  royalty deal then you are looking at  per unit sold for a total of  per year nice payout if it sells at the minimum of storeweek this is k per year this is not to say that getting a product into a mass retailer is easy—it definitely is not and many of them test in a small number of stores slowly getting if ever to a full national rolloutbut the idea is to begin with the market in mind and likely a mass market which is often not the designers propensity when in licensing mode the successful designer abandons the many cool product ideas that she has which do not have a chance at mass appeal and large distribution please check out my royalty calculator to help estimate the potential licensing payoff—do this before working too much on the idea as it just may not be financially worthwhile for you remember you not only have to develop the idea but will have to sell it which takes time and is the topic of a future articleuse a royalty calculator to vet new ideas for licensing potentialthe last issue to consider in the calculus is time how long will the product sell product lifespans vary by industry but usually there are growth maturity and dropoffstages you should probably not expect more than  years of strong royalty checks for a given product before sales begin to slide if a product is successful you are assured of sales dilution from knockoffs or derivations that quickly follow and financial derailment can easily happen at any turn given the vagaries of corporate politics and strategy as well as innumerable external threats for an excellent inventors account of the rise and maturation of an innovative electrical power strip read christopher hawkers the song of the powersquidpowersquid licensed by trident designthe other time element to consider is the wait for your first royalty check after signing a licensing agreement plan on  to  years if at all firstly licensing deals fall through all the time even just weeks after the agreement is inked this is because the company wants to sign an agreement before they invest time and money in actual product development—when things usually fall apart licensees also want a contract signed before they present the idea to potential retail buyers if there is not enough initial interest the project gets dropped and the contract is nullified you may be able to negotiate a kill clause in the contract that offers a small fee if the licensee chooses not to move forwardif there is preliminary interest from buyers often based on renderings or prototypes you still have to wait for product development packaging certifications manufacturing and shipping you may also have to wait up to a year to get into a mass retailer depending on when they update their storeshelf planograms and then you wait at least three months as royalties are commonly paid quarterly so licensing is not a quick and easy road to riches just as with all other legal enterprises but it can pay off and work for you if you have the right expectations in my experience and in speaking with other licensors making kyear licensing a  massmarket item is doing pretty well of the  new kitchen products introduced each year as many as  of new products fail according to the food networks invention hunters there is a lot of competition and flailing products may generate just  royalty dollars per year a dental company with a large catalog that i licensed a product to even maintains that a product with k of net yearly sales is average and worth keeping in the catalog—dhello there  quarterly royalty checks this is why you usually need to maintain a number of licensed products inevitably in various stages of growth maturity and decline to make a proper living out of itbut you can certainly hit it big too and this is what keeps the dream alive and can make product licensing exciting like all other forms of work you are better off being energized by what you do most especially if there is no guaranteed payoff and it is important to have the right expectations about the chances of getting a license getting a product to market getting sufficient distribution and ultimately getting a decent royalty check you should always run the numbers on what your payday might be with a new idea given the pricepoint distribution and likely royalty rate before investing your time and certainly your money on prototypes and intellectual property protection it can be a fun and lucrative ride but its not getrichquick for the overwhelming majority of new product licensors the latest design news jobs  events straight to you

potential licensee presumably they would need to be convinced that it is not significantly biased in any way eg its your friends and family are the respondents and the questions are not leading fundamentally it needs to be good information that moves toward standards of validity reliability and generalizability  other marketing data can be helpful as well like a market analysis of the competitors though often if a licensee is in the industry they have a better sense of this than you might honestly i am not so sure that a bunch of positive comments from unknown peoplejust nameswould have a great deal of influence it is certainly better than if they were bad comments but do these people actually represent those who might purchase have you determined a target market that would be meaningfulrelevant to the licensee  just because someone likes the idea does not mean that they are moved to purchase perhaps there are other ways to get user feedback or more specific or more useful feedback i have seen very convincing videos of people using products where it is obvious that they are amazed or convinced or otherwise pleased perhaps you want to convey that it is easy to use and you show candid videosno need for high production of course you want to do the research that helps answer the most important questions that a licensee would have and that would help mitigate riskyour research is valuable to them when it might save them money in having to do it themselves just like with product development efforts or marketing efforts of the designerinventor  if i was a potential licensee i might be more concerned with how your solution compares to other competitive productslike air in a can for example do people prefer yours at what price what are their biggest concerns or barriers to purchasegenerally research provided by the inventor at the pitch stage would likely only nudge a licensee unless it was powerful research that was believable third parties are helpful but of course add costbut perhaps just as much as convincing a licensee research helps you the inventor know more and be more confident or better understand the shortcomings which all products do and how to address thembest of luckbruce report as spam albert culmer bruce and stephanie tharp  months ago z z reply thanks bruce for checking my product out and for your honest opinion a couple of years ago i had done another survey on another product i invented i got over  people to give me a rating from  to  and most all of my ratings i got all nines and tens after i did the survey i decided to market it myself so i took it to walmart  they wanted me to demonstrate my product to them after i demonstrated my product the manager told me that he loved my idea and he told one of the other managers that were in the room with us to take me where the beach equipment was he showed me that he had a place on the shelf where they would display my product i was surprised that walmart was ready to do business with me they were ready for me to start manufacturing my product by the thousands but i had to tell them that i will have to get back with them because i didnt have any experience in marketing thats why i am trying to put my products into a manufacturers hands like stephen key says we should do and let the manufacturing company handle everything for me i have many great ideas but i dont know how to read or write because i had dyslexia and i also got lead poisoning when i was a kid in the bahamas so it makes it very hard for me to do what i am trying to do but i know one day i will be able to get my products into a manufacturer company hands  report as spam albert culmer  months ago z z reply hi bruce i would like to have your honest opinion on what you think about my

deal the issue of indemnity is very important this is protection if something goes wrongit is not uncommon for a licensee to try and put the liability for a  problem onto the designer but it is not fair in general in my opinion it is understandable that they would try but i have never singed a contract with this in my experience once i raised my concerns the company changed the contract in every case because they realize that it is unfairif they are actually manufacturing the product why would you be responsible if it fails likely they will be doing the engineering and fabrication which you have no control over  i suggest that you express your concernsremember everything is negotiable also remember that they are making the lions share of the profitthe only liability that i have taken on is over the originality of the idea to the extent that i know it makes sense that they have no idea if you actually stole your idea from someone and would be concerned about that while i accept liability if it turns out that i knowingly and willingly violated someone elses intellectual property i do not accept liability for the overall originality of the idea independent designers are generally not in a position to enter into intellectual property litigationthis could be a frivolous claim or a legitimate one or an international one they should be willing to take that risk on just as they do with their own productsmy sense is that they will understand your concernsmake them known respectfully in the spirit of negotiation but in the end you should not take on liability for anything that is out of your control because litigation can be a bankrupter which is why they want to try to and get you to take it on rather than themselves if you let them report as spam ximena rozo

should say the first part is easy you already know the companies so just call them and try and speak to someone on the phone it may take a while to find the right person but if they are game for this kind of thing you will find them it is certainly possible that they are not open to this as companies run a risk with open innovation but the problem you have is that there is no intellectual property to protect companies are loath to pay for something that cannot be protected your best bet is to try and have a conversation with themideally protected by an nda but that may be challengingto see if they are game if they are you would need to find a way to directly measure the financial impact of your idea the least risk for them is a royalty for that market in my opinion this only has a small chance of working out for you but is still worth pursuing because you have very little invested in it you should always be thinking about return on investment and if this were to hit any money you would get from them would prove to be a high percentage without an nda though they could very easily take your idea with no recourse but what have you got to lose if you do not try what would you do with your idea anyway  good luck report as spam bruce m tharp  years ago z z reply dougthanks for your comments below is some information regarding oxos process i am not sure if it is still up to date

publicizing product opportunities you identify  what is the point helping other firms get it to market before you this has always been a catandmouse game you normally win by being faster and having higher conceptual fluency than the next guy or gal i have a half dozen license deals but always tried to go for ideasproducts with the shortest development cycle cant believe people will invest years in a concept then find out the market has long moved on great series though numbers are right on most people cannot retire on royalties as product lifetimes keep shortening so you have to run constantly not like finding oil in your back yard report as spam doug chew  years ago z z reply i agree with you completely eric  someone at meetup told me about holding a chinese knockoff before someones crowdfunding campaign had completeddougoakland ca report as spam jeff madden  years ago z z reply addendum the coveted object of greatest worth to me in the license game is not a new design as much as a new problem design is the easy part phones at best buy identifying a new problem that is the hard part which brings me to your comment on quirky i am very cautious of what i submit to quirky i rarely submit a design that identifies a new problem because that ip is very precious and first to market with the solution to new problem is a huge advantage even when the problem is only perceived report as spam doug chew  years ago z z reply as an inventor i agree with you jeffdougoakland ca report as spam jeff madden  years ago z z reply bruce your article is right on the money my

bruce m tharp  years ago z z reply ray thanks it is difficult to give a good representation of the financial upside because there is so much variability designersinventors who do a lot of licensing have a pretty wide rangesome products that may only generate kyear some in the kyear range and others that are a hit and generate k if not k often great products do not sell well for any number of reasons beyond the design what we can control it is interesting to look at quirkycom and the sales numbers of their products since they share them it is a long road to just get to market on quirky but the big hurdle is marketplace acceptance which can be disappointing as the numbers tell dan congratulations after you get that first one under your belt it can be addictive if you are game i would
