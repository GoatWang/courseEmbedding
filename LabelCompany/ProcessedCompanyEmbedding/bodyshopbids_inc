do business brad weisberg founder and ceo of bodyshopbids inc in chicago ill wwwbodyshopbidscom uses technology to revolutionize the car repair bidding process for insurers and consumers opening in  with  from an incubator weisberg set out to simplify the bid process by having customers send smartphone photos to his site to obtain bids three venture capital firms subsequently invested  million a second entrepreneur developed european prototypes of innersprings for mattresses to increase comfort in  with an investors  president and ceo susanne flother of somnium inc in venice calif wwwsomniumbedscom began developing and patenting the technology the investor added  before a second one brought  wholesale sales began in  bumps principals at somnium tried every angle to sell their washable recyclable lighter product exploring several niches they found the product too complex even for mattress stores they tried doctors and chiropractors who referred one at a time nothing sufficiently jumpstarted sales how could they make the unusual fit in a stodgy market exhausted and frustrated they couldnt reach enough people they exhibited at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york we finally were seen by people who understood the product flother says it was phenomenal  very very exciting to see people enjoy the product and understand it now the mattresses sell in  fine furniture stores bodyshopbids landed in a pothole early on with insufficient revenue to meet payroll weisberg lost sleep the night before he planned to take action it was the most nervewracking thing i ever had to do he remarks i had four employees and we were essentially out of money i brought everyone into the room sat them down and told them he continues i felt sick to my stomach i told them about my vision of the future  to help businesses and people the contract for the first million dollars arrived in two weeks with family around him weisberg signed it and felt validated by the hugs and phototaking back at the office he paid the three employees an email from someone in the industry prompted weisberg to expand beyond inshop upgrades such as oil changes and tire rotations he learned that speeding up the claims process would save insurers an average of  per day and that he needed to be open to new ways of offering his service the savings would also translate into happy clients for insurers he expects last years  gross revenue to grow to  in  flother learned that unusual products move best when represented by their entrepreneurs although the website helps when you have many things to talk about she says the challenge is to come up with the one that will resonate the most last years revenue reached  jobs created bodyshopbids inc chicago
