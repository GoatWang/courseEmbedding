charges free fullspeed accelerator what is fullspeed what gets accelerated is it really free how does it work system requirements download now what is fullspeed fullspeed is an internet accelerator for your dialup internet connection the main bottleneck to browsing the internet over dialup is the slow speed of a modem connection the fullspeed client is a program that you install on your computer when it is running the client will automatically compress text and images downloaded by your web browser for you compressed content is smaller content therefore your modem will download it faster and your web pages will load noticeably faster the actual speedup ratio varies depending on how graphicintensive the typical website you visit is on average with typical web browsing you can expect websites to come up between three and five times fastertext compresses very well and depending on the text in question it can download anywhere from one to  times faster a typical speed increase for text on web pages is about  times faster fullspeed accelerates image downloading too but since these are already optimized files they cannot compress as well as text by attempting to optimize the image further its compression ratio can increase these compressed images may look a little grainier than the original ones but download noticeably faster with fullspeed�s default settings images download an average of  times faster with only a slight cost in image clarity you can adjust the speedquality ratio to your preferences and retain the option to switch back to the original images please note that the text and image speed increase only applies to files downloaded through a web browser http fullspeed does not affect files downloaded or uploaded by ftp https and file sharing programs or streaming audiovideo fullspeed also includes a basic popup killer which prevents most types of popup ads it also has the ability as to block flash advertising that floats on top of text articles back to top what gets accelerated fullspeed compresses the following in order to send the information to your computer faster web pages  html markupjavascript xml and style sheetst graphics including jpeg and gif images flash content email  smtp and pop including file attachments and is compatible with any imap or popsmtp client including microsoft�outlook express and netscape� mail and ftp text what will not be accelerated although fullspeed is able to compress many different types of online data there are a few which cannot be accelerated streaming media audio and video files secure pages such as those used for online banking and credit card forms additional features other valueadded features of the accelerator software include popup blocker  block annoying popup advertisements while surfing bannerad blocking  stop the ads and surf faster integrated diagnostic support tool privacy management back to top is it really free yes fullspeed is completely free for all new and existing fullnet members back to top how does it work with traditional dialup methods the text and graphics that make up web pages get sent from the server to you over your phone line because of the large amount of data required to be sent this process can be painfully slow fullspeed compresses this data using a proprietary technology and sends it over your existing dialup phone line this compression process allows a smaller amount data to be sent  sometimes more than five times less  making the download time of your web pages and your online experience that much faster as an added download time reducer fullspeed stores elements of the web sites you visit frequently eliminating the need to redownload them every time you visit these sites back to top system requirements
