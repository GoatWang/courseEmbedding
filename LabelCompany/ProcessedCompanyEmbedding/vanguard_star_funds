right one tailor your portfolio to your needs rather than vanguard star’s onesizefitsall approach by dan wiener editor the independent adviser for vanguard investors    nov    am edt     popular posts how to invest when the sp  is at alltime highs recent posts vix just misses top most volatile days in  years stay seated until the economy reaches cruising altitude don’t get too caught up in headlines view all posts investors often respond to complicated questions about their finances by gravitating to a simple solution even if it’s the wrong one typically the simple solution is expedient more than anything else vanguard star fund vgstx is one such fund — it’s a lifecycle fund that is and always has been geared to small investors who don’t have enough money to diversify on their own once the only option for the little guy at vanguard vanguard star has since gotten some competition from the target retirement funds which now also have  minimums that low minimum remains vanguard star’s biggest appeal but some investors may be happier with the lower expenses and indexheavy approach at a target retirement fund leave the low returns of lifecycle funds of course why wouldn’t we go for the promises that have been made about these funds funds like vanguard’s star lifestrategy line and the series of target retirement funds sure seem like a simple solution to the complex problem of retirement investing but as it turns out the simple solution on paper is not always the best the problem is that investing in one of vanguard’s many setitandforgetit lifecycle funds is nowhere near the same as investing in a welltuned portfolio of individual vanguard funds geared to your objectives and risk tolerance it may feel like you’re doing your money some good by investing in a lifecycle fund but with a little extra effort you can do better as your assets grow and with it presumably your tax rate it makes sense to more finely hone your portfolio rather than simply leave it in a fund like star there are better options particularly for taxable investors who have in the past lost some  of their star gains to taxes each year lifecycle funds proved to be a bit more complicated and fraught with problems in reality than in theory most stark huge unexpected losses suffered during the last bear market which was the first bear for most lifecycle funds and shareholders the fast side of investors’ brains got the better of them and i would blame the fastthinking sides of the mutual fund industry’s brains as well who figured out a good marketing pitch before they figured out whether they were pushing a good product properly of course as we’ve seen all too often over the past several decades this “market first” mentality is nothing new for the fund industry sun is setting on vanguard star vanguard star has had a long healthy life — but given the turnover and addition of fund managers at every equity fund in the portfolio except primecap it’s hard to say this is still the star fund of old and when it comes to risk this fund showed it in  and  as its maximum cumulative loss which previously stood at  a loss suffered in the  market drop was obliterated senior editor dan
