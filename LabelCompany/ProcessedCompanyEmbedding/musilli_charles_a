defendantsrespondents south professional salesservice express and charles a harrington associates inc defendantsappellants     decided april   present  martoche jp centra lunn fahey and gorski jjlaw office of walter r pacer jr buffalo james d schultz jr of counsel for defendantappellant south pro sales inc doing business as service express incorrectly sued as south professional salesservice express getnick livingston atkinson gigliotti  priore llp utica michael e getnick of counsel for defendantappellant charles a harrington associates inc brown chiari llp lancaster samuel j capizzi of counsel for plaintiffrespondent rivkin radler llp uniondale cheryl f korman of counsel for defendantsrespondents  plaintiff commenced this action seeking damages for injuries he sustained during the course of his employment at a home depot store when a shower door manufactured by defendant kohler company kohler fell from its display and struck him   supreme court properly denied that part of the cross motion of defendant south pro sales inc doing business as service express incorrectly sued as south professional salesservice express south pro seeking summary judgment dismissing the supplemental complaint and cross claim of defendant charles a harrington inc harrington with respect to the issue whether south pro had constructive notice of the allegedly defective condition of the shower door display   we reject at the outset the contention of south pro that it did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff   the record establishes that south pro had entered into a comprehensive service contract with kohler that placed “full responsibility” on south pro to ensure inter alia that the kohler shower door displays were in safe condition and in full repair   the contract further required south pro to inspect the displays at the subject home depot store every two weeks to establish a strong working relationship with that store and to train home depots management with respect to kohlers products   we thus conclude that based on the terms of the contract between south pro and kohler there is an issue of fact on the record before us whether south pros contract with kohler was so “ ‘comprehensive and exclusive’ that it entirely displaced home depots duty to maintain the premises safely” espinal v melville snow contrs  nyd    nysd   ned  quoting palka v servicemaster mgt servs corp  nyd    nysd   ned  contrary to the further contention of south pro the court properly concluded that it failed to establish as a matter of law that it lacked constructive notice of the allegedly defective condition of the shower door display see generally zuckerman v city of new york  nyd    nysd   ned    it is undisputed that the shower door that struck plaintiff was attached to the display with selftapping screws and that such screws were insufficient to secure the display   because south pro was required by its contract with kohler to inspect the display every two weeks we agree with the court that there is an issue of fact whether south pro had constructive notice of the defective condition of the display see generally atkinson v golub corp co  add    nysd  the court also properly denied the motion of harrington kohlers representative to the subject home depot store prior to south pro seeking summary judgment dismissing the supplemental complaint and cross claim of south pro against it   harrington failed to meet its initial burden of establishing that it did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff inasmuch as it failed to establish in support of its motion that it did not install the shower door display and thus that it did not “ ‘launch  a force or instrument of harm’ ” espinal  nyd at   nysd   ned    we further conclude that harrington failed to establish as a matter of law that it did not create the allegedly defective condition and that it did not have actual or constructive notice of that condition see generally atkinson  add at   nysd it is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without costsmemorandum findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic judicial clerk summer associate intern law librarian
