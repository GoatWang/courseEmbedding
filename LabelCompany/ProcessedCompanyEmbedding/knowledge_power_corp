management can benefit everyone from a local newsstand to a manufacturing firm this guide explains the basic sources of knowledge available to your business how you can best harness and exploit this information and how to create a knowledge strategy for your business what is knowledge in a business basic sources of knowledge exploiting your knowledge make knowledge central to your business sharing knowledge across your business create a knowledge strategy for your business using information technology to gain and manage knowledge what is knowledge in a business using knowledge in your business isnt necessarily about thinking up clever new products and services or devising ingenious new ways of selling them its much more straightforward useful and important knowledge already exists in your business it can be found in the experience of your employees the designs and processes for your goods and services your files of documents whether held digitally on paper or both your plans for future activities such as ideas for new products or services the challenge is harnessing this knowledge in a coherent and productive way existing forms of knowledge youve probably done market research into the need for your business to exist in the first place if nobody wanted what youre selling you wouldnt be trading you can tailor this market knowledge to target particular customers with specific types of product or service your files of documents from and about customers and suppliers hold a wealth of information which can be invaluable both in developing new products or services and improving existing ones your employees are likely to have skills and experience that you can use as an asset having staff who are knowledgeable can be invaluable in setting you apart from competitors you should make sure that your employees knowledge and skills are passed on to their colleagues and successors wherever possible eg through brainstorming sessions training courses and documentation see the page in this guide create a knowledge strategy for your business your understanding of what customers want combined with your employees knowhow can be regarded as your knowledge base using this knowledge in the right way can help you run your business more efficiently decrease business risks and exploit opportunities to the full this is known as the knowledge advantage basic sources of knowledge your sources of business knowledge could include customer knowledge  you should know your customers needs and what they think of you you may be able to develop mutually beneficial knowledge sharing relationships with customers by talking to them about their future requirements and discussing how you might be able to develop your own products or services to ensure that you meet their needs employee and supplier relationships  seek the opinions of your employees and your suppliers  theyll have their own impressions of how youre performing you can use formal surveys to gather this knowledge or ask for their views on a more informal basis market knowledge  watch developments in your sector how are your competitors performing how much are they charging are there any new entrants to the market have any significant new products been launched knowledge of the business environment  your business can be affected by numerous outside factors developments in politics the economy technology society and the environment could all affect your business development so you need to keep yourself informed you could consider setting up a team of employees to monitor and report on changes in the business world professional associations and trade bodies  their publications academic publications government publications reports from research bodies trade and technical magazines trade exhibitions and conferences  these can provide an easy way of finding out what your competitors are doing and to see the latest innovations in your sector product research and development  scientific and technical research and development can be a vital source of knowledge that can help you create innovative new products  retaining your competitive edge organisational memory  be careful not to lose the skills or experience your business has built up you need to find formal ways of sharing your employees knowledge about the best ways of doing things for example you might create procedural guidance based on your employees best practice see the page in this guide create a knowledge strategy for your business nonexecutive directors  these can be a good way for you to bring on board specialised industry experience and benefit from readymade contracts exploiting your knowledge consider the measurable benefits of capturing and using knowledge more effectively the following are all possible outcomes an improvement in the goods or services you offer and the processes that you use to sell them for example identifying market trends before they happen might enable you to offer products and services to customers before your competitors increased customer satisfaction because you have a greater understanding of their requirements through feedback from customer communications an increase in the quality of your suppliers resulting from better awareness of what customers want and what your staff require improved staff productivity because employees are able to benefit from colleagues knowledge and expertise to find out the best way to get things done theyll also feel more appreciated in a business where their ideas are listened to increased business efficiency by making better use of inhouse expertise better recruitment and staffing policies for instance if youve increased knowledge of what your customers are looking for youre better able to find the right staff to serve them the ability to sell or license your knowledge to others you may be able to use your knowledge and expertise in an advisory or consultancy capacity in order to do so though make sure that you protect your intellectual property make knowledge central to your business in order to manage the collection and exploitation of knowledge in your business you should try to build a culture in which knowledge is valued across your business one way to do this might be to offer incentives to staff who supply useful market news or suggest ways customers can be better served you can use these knowledge management practices throughout your organisation to build better processes as part of your knowledge management you should also make sure that any intellectual property that your business holds is protected this means that you have the right to stop competitors from copying it  and also allows you to profit by licensing your business knowledge protecting and exploiting your knowledge base will be more effective if you develop efficient systems for storing and retrieving information your files  whether stored digitally or on paper  contain knowledge that you can use to make your products services systems and processes better and more customerfocused keep knowledge confidential your employment policies play a central role in this for example you might get staff to sign nondisclosure agreements also known as confidentiality agreements when they join the business as this ensures that they understand the importance of confidentiality from day one employment contracts can be written to reasonably limit your employees freedom to quit and work immediately for one of your rivals restraint of trade clauses or set up a competing business to yours in the vicinity restrictive covenants sharing knowledge across your business its essential to avoid important knowledge or skills being held by only a few people because if they leave or retire that expertise could be lost to your business if you have efficient ways of sharing knowledge across the business it will be more widely used and its value and effectiveness are likely to be maximised knowledge sharing consider the best ways of sharing new ideas and information with your staff you may already have regular meetings when you can brief employees and ask them to share ideas and best practice you could consider holding innovation workshops or brainstorming sessions at which staff are given the freedom and encouragement to think of ways in which the business could improve it can also be a good idea to create a knowledge bank containing useful information and instructions on how to carry out key tasks putting this on an intranet is ideal as it will encourage staff to post news or suggestions knowledge management technology alone isnt the answer to sharing knowledge  it has to be managed carefully so that information is channelled properly you may decide to appoint a senior manager as knowledge champion for your business see the page in this guide on how to make knowledge central to your business incentives and training remember that offering staff incentives to come up with suggestions for how the business can be improved is often an effective way of getting them to use and share knowledge dont forget the importance of training in spreading key knowledge skills and best practice across your business create a knowledge strategy for your business if you want to get the most from your business knowledge you need to take a strategic approach to discovering collating and sharing it this is done via a knowledge strategy  a set of written guidelines to be applied across the business if your strategy is to be effective you must make sure your senior managers are committed to it and are fully aware of the benefits it can bring discuss with them the best ways of collecting and using knowledge you may decide to appoint a senior manager as knowledge champion for your business for more information see the page in this guide on how to make knowledge central to your business when youre drawing up the strategy you need to consider how effective your business currently is at using its knowledge analyse your internal processes for gathering and sharing information  are there successful ways of generating ideas and do staff have a good grasp of whats happening make sure that knowledge management acquisition and distribution is a continuing process so that it becomes central to your business strategy you should also identify the value of knowledge to your business think of ways you could exploit your knowledge for financial gain  perhaps by gaining a larger market share developing new products or selling or licensing your protected intellectual property to others ensure this fits in with your overall business plan using information technology to gain and manage knowledge information technology offers powerful tools to help you gain and make the best use of knowledge some of the systems can be complex to set up and timeconsuming to maintain you need to choose systems that fit with your business and that will improve it without becoming a burden you may find it useful to consult an it specialist types of information technology databases organise information so it can be easily accessed managed and updated for instance you might have a database of customers containing their contact information their orders and preferences a data warehouse is a central storage area you might use if you have a variety of business systems or a range of information in different digital formats many businesses now use digital asset management to store manage and retrieve information and this can be particularly helpful if you sell online it is however a complex area technically and in task management and you may wish to seek specialist advice from an it consultant data mining is a process in which all the data you collect is sorted to determine patterns for instance it can tell you which products are most popular and whether one type of customer is likely to buy a particular item reporting and querying tools let you create reports interpreting data in a particular way how many of your sales have been handled by one particular employee for instance business intelligence portals are websites that bring together all sorts of potentially useful information such as legal issues or details of new research the internet and search engines  these can be a powerful source of knowledge although be certain to check the credibility of your information source internet newsgroups can be specific sources of business information but check the authors other postings before deciding how to view their opinions and claimed facts an intranet is a secure internal network for the sole use of your business an extranet is similar to an intranet but can be extended to customers and suppliers customer relationship management software

customers if you sell by telephone website logfile analysis helps you to analyse how customers use your website so you can improve its effectiveness systems to analyse and file customer letters

story knowledge is power june th marks national hiv testing day in the united states download as pdf jun   a single test made all the difference in the life of nancy khurana  a busy advertising professional who learned she was hiv positive in december  today shes using her experience to bring knowledge and hope to others it hits you in a powerful way said khurana who was diagnosed a year and a half ago its like something has been robbed from you but you dont know what all you know is something has been taken from you naturally she had all sorts of questions – what does this mean has my lifespan been reduced do i have aids following her diagnosis khurana started her hiv treatment and began a personal journey of coming to terms with her diagnosis and educating herself and her family and friends about the disease the first weekend of treatment she contacted her doctor because she was feeling very ill at one point during the conversation khurana admitted to her doctor that she was a little overwhelmed by everything the conversation was far from doom and gloom though her doctor told her in one year youre not even going to remember who i am youre going to forget me because you won’t need me anymore ill have to be calling you to remind you of your checkups and following up with you because youre doing so well my doctor was right said khurana i had no idea how advanced hiv medications are how research is developing i didnt think there was hope – and a lot of other people may feel that way too because they may not know how far weve come with diagnosing and treating hiv more than one year later khurana feels great and the level of the virus in her blood is undetectable she attributes her good health to getting tested early and getting on the right therapy she wants to dispel the myth that hiv is something that happens to certain types of people its an equal opportunity virus and people of all sexual orientations ages and races can be at risk she said yet of the  million people living with hiv globally  million people dont know it thats why getting tested is so important – because early detection can save a persons life getting tested needs to be something people talk about whether youre high risk or not khurana said for me it was a real turning point if i hadnt said yes to getting tested for hiv when my doctor brought it up i would have gone on with my life not even knowing i was positive as for how life with hiv has changed her khurana said im still the same person but since my diagnosis ive focused on what’s really important its strengthened my faith and made me more grateful for the small things in life khurana on a trip to portugal and khuranas not only focusing on making the most of her life – shes also helping others do the same as an advocate for the aids foundation of chicago khurana encourages people to know their hiv status by getting tested and offers her support to those whove just been diagnosed last year she ran the chicago half marathon as a member of team to end aids this year khurana is supporting the same team by doing the full marathon for the first time today khurana hopes to help others by sharing her experiences with them i try to focus on what matters to me i also try not to get stressed because its not worth the energy – its better to use it on more uplifting things now i see the lighter side of things and i laugh a lot more please visit these resources to learn more about hiv video nancys story     feature how one test changed hiv infographic a look back at hiv testing infographic the safety of the
