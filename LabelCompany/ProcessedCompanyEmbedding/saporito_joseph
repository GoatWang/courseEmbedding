ceremony as a us magistrate judge for the middle district of pennsylvania on thursday in the william j nealon federal building and us courthouse in scranton near the conclusion of the ceremony that made him the middle district of pennsylvania’s newest us magistrate judge joseph f saporito jr recalled the best advice he ever received from his father and mentor the late attorney joseph saporito sr it passed from father to son when judge saporito became a lawyer almost  years ago and the judge called it appropriate not only for the position he now holds but also in life “it consists of five
