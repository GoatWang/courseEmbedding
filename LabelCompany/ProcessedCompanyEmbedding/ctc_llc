the perfect product for your specific needs and requirementshistorythe coned and threaded connection originated out of a us government research program in the late s fixed nitrogen research laboratory fnrl focused on a means for converting atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates those means being of high pressure necessitated development of a high pressure tube connection machined into pressure vessels valves and fittings fnrl worked with an american company to develop the coned and threaded connection and components by the mid0s valves fittings tubing and other accessories of high strength steel were brought to market with a coned and threaded connectionctc training sample tool  the ctc coned threaded connection training sample tool is a cutaway with a medium pressure and high pressure connection assembly  this training tool is designed to teach the assembly procedure of the connections and to show the difference between the medium pressure and high pressure connection assembly instructions for standard coned  threaded connections slide the gland nut onto the end of the tubing with the threads facing the cone and threaded end of the tube  screw the left handed threaded collar onto the tube until one to two threads of the tube end are exposed from the tapered coned end do not thread the collar to back of the tube nipple threads apply a compatible lubricant to the gland threads and the back side of the collar where it comes in contact with the gland also lubricate the tapered cone portion of the tube with a system compatible lubricant this will help protect the sealing surfaces from galling during the assembly process insert the gland collar and tubing assembly into the female connection  thread the gland into the connection and tighten the assembly hand tight  tighten the gland nut to the required torque value of the connectionnote in cases with the smaller fittings it is good practice to use an additional wrench to hold the mating fitting in place
