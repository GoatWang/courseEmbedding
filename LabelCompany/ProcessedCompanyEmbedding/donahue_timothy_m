orange lawyer slapped with  sanction for recycling his work wednesday november   at  am by matt coker a a facebook twitter  more shares recommend reddit email  print article a california appellate justice in santa ana slapped an orange attorney with a scathing opinion and  in sanctions tuesday for essentially failing to do his homeworktalk about the wrong reaction the lawyer in question responded back that justice william bedsworth of the fourth district court of appeal must have erred and meant to sanction the opposing counseldohmay it please the court if i present the evidence of this dimness in chronological ordergil kim sued two businessmen for allegedly failing to repay loans hed made to them after the defendants didnt respond to the complaint an orange county superior court judge signed a default judgment against them for  million they appealed to the fourth on grounds that kims complaint failed to set forth a valid cause of action a panel composed of bedworth and justices eileen moore and richard fybel agreed overturning the judgment bedsworth upcoming events orange county soccer club v okc energy fc tickets fri aug  pm usa womens volleyball cupusa vs brazil tickets sun aug  pm premium seating los angeles angels v oakland athletics tickets mon aug  pm los angeles angels vs oakland athletics tickets mon aug  pm but as lawcom reports bedworth went farther than that in his kim v westmoore partners opinion warning trial court judges to be more careful about entering default judgments noting that its their duty to act as gatekeeper ensuring that only the appropriate claims get through the justice reserved most of his ire for plaintiff attorney timothy j donahue howeverour profession is rife with cynicism awash in incivility bedsworth wrote lawyers and judges of our generation spend a great deal of time lamenting the loss of a golden age when lawyers treated each other with respect and courtesy its time to stop talking about the problem and act on itwhat set bedsworth off donahue asked for an extension to research complex issues raised by his opponents brief then the legal eagle filed an almost verbatim duplicate of a brief hed filed with the same court in a personal injury matter two years earlier failing to change language that had nothing to do with the breachofcontract casefor instancethe defendants were personally familiar with the events and the accident donahue oopsiethe client from the earlier case was also named in donahues responsewtfthe confusion about the sanctions likely stems from donahue having sought in identical language from both briefs  in sanctions against his opposing attorneys because their appeals was frivoloussanctions are serious business bedsworth wrote they deserve more thought than the choice of a salad dressing ill have the sanctions please no on second thought bring me the balsamic im trying to lose a few pounds    a request for sanctions should be reserved for serious violations of the standard of practice not used as a bullying tacticdonahue defended himself for copying the earlier brief by asserting i have the right to modify my own work producttimothy j donahue saving the planet
