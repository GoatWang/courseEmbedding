invests across a broad range of global fixed income sectors including core us investment grade noninvestment grade nonus country currency and floating rate asset classes the fund’s benchmark is the barclays capital us universal index philosophy the portfolio adheres to three core investment tenets value diversification and protection against downside risk   valuedriven the portfolio seeks to invest in sectors that offer attractive relative value based on fundamentals and on spread relationships to longterm averages value investing seeks to capitalise on the benefits of rebalancing through dynamic allocation which can make a significant contribution to portfolio returns over time   broad diversification the portfolio’s diversification level seeks to benefit from incorporating a broad range of factors and sectors which helps it pursue attractive riskadjusted returns diversification available from asset classes with lower correlation to core sectors can help reduce volatility and downside risk   protection against downside risk the portfolio has historically been successful in limiting downside risk and avoiding permanent impairment of capital has reflected its disciplined approach to limiting issuer concentrations combined with strong fundamental credit research avoiding atrisk sectors and avoiding market value loss in rising interest rate environments     diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss integrated investment process the portfolio’s active valuedriven investment process combines topdown and bottomup research with the
