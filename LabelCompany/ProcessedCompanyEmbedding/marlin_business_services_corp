equipment through a financing plan that fits your budget rather than whatever capital or cash is currently available to you in addition to the ease of acquiring new equipment financing also offers several other benefits in the current economic climate purchasing through a financing program means taking advantage of tax incentives when you buy through leasetopurchase options the amount that is saved on taxes has the potential to be even more than what is paid in the first year of the lease in other words businesses can make money from the first day of the lease equipment financing is also beneficial for asset management such programs provide the use of equipment for specified periods at fixed rates if the you choose to return the equipment at the end of the period the financing company disposes of the equipment upon the equipment’s return as the business environment continues to change you can use equipment financing to better manage cash flow ultimately resulting in lower costs and
