loud disarming laugh the regal entertainment group chief exec cultivates an informal atmosphere at the firm’s nondescript corporate headquarters in knoxville tenn instead of using the intercom to chat with chief operating officer gregory dunn she often shouts back and forth with her deputy from her adjoining officethis story first appeared in the october   issue of variety subscribe todaysee more but despite her affability the yearold miles is a shrewd operator tasked with overseeing the world’s largest theater chain comprising  screens across  theaters not only is she one of the most influential figures in entertainment she is one of only two women — with national amusements’ shari redstone — currently heading a major circuit the national assn of theatre owners the exhibition industry’s lobbying arm has relied increasingly on miles to be one of its most important messengers “it’s important to have women in leading positions in this business” says nato president john fithian “because women buy most of our tickets every year” see morevariety’s  power of women studio executives describe miles as a force to be reckoned with “she’s a tough negotiator” says rory bruer head of worldwide distribution at sony pictures “i would not suggest anybody try to get something past her” for instance when netflix and the weinstein co announced late last month that they would release a sequel to “crouching tiger hidden dragon” online and in select imax theaters simultaneously regal joined amc cinemark and carmike in declaring a boycott of the film along with her shrewd negotiating skills miles is known for helping engineer the exhibition industry’s conversion to digital cinema but the regal chief will need to stay vigilant as change and severe challenges confront the theater business like all exhibitors regal must keep moviegoing fresh to survive in an era where netflix smartphones and videogames represent an existential threat see more women’s impact report “i have to keep thinking about ways to make you get off your couch and come to my location” says miles a former accountant who has run regal since  “we have to keep improving our asset base” to that end regal is investing in infrastructure installing luxury seating across  screens this year and has begun serving alcohol in  theaters the chain is trying out new concessions expanding its offerings to include finger foods this year has been a bruising one for the theatrical business the summer domestic bo plunged  to its worst numbers since  when adjusted for inflation yeartodate ticket receipts stateside are down  and attendance is off  still the regal chief says she views the downturn as an aberration in particular she’s excited for  and  which bring sequels to james bond “star wars” “superman” and “the avengers” “if you go back  years it’s been peaks and valleys” miles says “the good news is we’ve worked ourselves up to higher peaks and higher valleys” greg miller for variety regal has not been immune to the box office doldrums in its most recent quarter the company missed wall street’s projections with revenue falling more than  to  million net income dipped modestly for now exhibition industry chiefs keep repeating that next year will be brighter investors seem to be buying that argument regal’s share price has stayed north of  throughout the summer but should ticket sales remain in a slump these companies could be looking at something far starker than a seasonal dip analysts and exhibition execs maintain that  could be a recordbreaker — which creates an opportune time for consolidation some movie theater owners may not want to invest in upgrading their facilities and the prospect of two strong years of box office growth make this an appealing time to sell that’s good news for an aggressive acquisitor like regal under miles the company has made deals for the likes of hollywood and signature theaters and hoyts cinemas with a  billion market cap and  million in cash on its balance sheet regal is well positioned to keep buying miles estimates there are between  to  us screens that would make attractive acquisition targets if they went on the block media analysts praise miles’ stewardship of regal commending her for being expansionist and fiscally prudent “even as the largest exhibitor in the industry they’re still looking for ways to tweak the model to enhance revenue” says analyst marla backer miles caters to different constituencies but being based in an office park in tennessee’s third largest city regal is geographically removed from the centers of finance and filmmaking “my team that negotiates with the studios” she says “they’re all here they’re not playing golf on fridays or saturdays with studio heads we’ve kept that distance which is healthy” knoxville is also the city where miles grew up met her husband dan went to college at the nearby u of tennessee and remained to raise two sons both now grown dan stayed home to look after the boys after amy was appointed chief financial officer at regal in  her father a contractor built her house and she regularly socializes with both of her sisters who live in knoxville growing up miles went to the movies nearly every saturday and she still considers herself a frequent ticketbuyer “studios always go after that fanboy” miles notes “i could fit right there with them i don’t catch opening weekends like i used to with my boys but when i look back at my moviegoing in any year what tops the box office is what i go to” regional roots aren’t the only thing separating miles from her fellow captains of exhibition she is a woman in a maledominated industry “i hope it’s changing” miles says about the lack of gender diversity “we all serve a customer base that’s not just a bunch of older white males for us to have a good perspective on our base we need diversity of gender diversity of color and a diversity of perspective” studio executives praise miles for her professionalism but they have clashed in the past perhaps no fight was more bruising than the one that erupted in  over plans by warners sony universal and th century fox to offer films via videoondemand  days after their theatrical release typically studios wait to make films available on home entertainment platforms until  days after they debut though regal was one of the chains that came out forcefully against attempts to shrink windows studio insiders say miles handled the situation diplomatically “she’s always level headed” says dan fellman president of domestic distribution at warner bros “exhibitors are our partners in this business but when issues come up some get a little more overheated than others not amy” fithian thinks miles’ background as an accountant for pricewaterhousecoopers where she spent a decade before joining regal in  keeps her from making any dustup personal “amy keeps it very professional” he says the studios ultimately backed away from the windows brinkmanship but privately many executives expect that the issue will be revisited as far as miles is concerned fiddling with home entertainment release dates could wreak havoc “that’s a slippery slope” she says “does a consumer’s perception that a movie’s going to be in my house sooner lower the overall box office pot that’s my concern” earlier this summer miles told investors and analysts that when the box office is booming it strengthens ties between studios and exhibitors but with ticket sales waning are things still rosy “the anticipation of good box office is carrying the day” miles says “over time that symbiotic relationship — i need movies they need movie theaters — keeps things stable” filed under amy milespower of womenregal entertainment groupweekly online want to

good says october   at  pm there was a post on facebook about your theatre giving  free tickets out all we had to do it like and share hit send and it would take you to a window where we were to aggressive five people to receive the tickets after my friends and i hit the send the little spinning thing like it was working to bring up the code never came up what a hoax just letting you know reply donna says october   at  pm dear amy miles i just came from the regal cinema in westborough massachusetts where i witnessed yet another person falling as they came into a dark theater and tried to locate a seat i have witnessed people falling many times in regal theaters because your facilities do not make it safe to enter or exit a theater with the lights on i do not understand that just because the lighting in these theaters are “preset” that they can not be changed to provide proper lighting i would love to see you or your staff enter a theater or exit and find a seat in the dark without tripping this is a public safety issue and i would love to see how innovative your are at fixing this public safety issue i will definitely not be purchasing any movie tickets from regal cinema until the lighting is on the light should only be off when the movie has started and people are seated then turned on again when the movie is off so that people can exit the theater safely our population is aging the elderly have vision issues and regal keeps their lights off so that you can trip and fall you should be ashamed reply see all  comments more film news from variety ad  miles

now i will turn the call over to amy miles amy e miles  regal entertainment group hello everyone and thank you for joining us this afternoon one year ago on this same call and on the heels of a record industry box office in  you heard us reference annual alltime highs in practically every metric commonly used to evaluate our performance and our industry im happy to report that one year later our message will be very similar once again an impressive slate of films delivered record industry box office results once again our efforts to improve the customer experience had a meaningful impact on our key financial metrics and once again we delivered record annual adjusted ebitda and meaningful growth in our adjusted ebitda margins needless to say were very thrilled with those results ill let david discuss our fourth quarter financial results a bit later in the call theyre impressive in their own right given the difficult comparison with last years record fourth quarter but before i turn the call over to david id like to spend a few minutes giving a more indepth look at the longterm impact of our strategic initiatives while we consistently provide relevant quarterly updates and statistics it may be difficult for investors to fully discern the big picture impact of these projects as they layer into our financial results over multiple quarters or even years to best demonstrate that impact we went back five years to fiscal  back then we were in the midst of the industrys conversion to digital projection our most important consumerfacing initiative was the rollout of imax rpx and dequipped screens and our concession per cap growth rate was at one of the lowest points in the last  years for the fiscal  year our  million attendees produced adjusted ebitda of just under  million now fastforward to  the difference is remarkable premium amenities luxury seating large format screens robust concession offerings and alcoholic beverages are available to more of our customers and at more of our theaters than ever before our industryleading loyalty program has almost  million active members our average ticket price and concession cap growth or per cap growth rates are at the high end of the historical range and most importantly a very similar attendance base of approximately of  million people produced adjusted ebitda of just over  million thats  million of adjusted ebitda growth over a fiveyear period in what is generally described as a mature industry again we are very thrilled with those results the key components of that growth are as follows over  million came from box office revenue net of film and advertising costs our investments in large format screens and luxury seating has allowed us flexibility to raise our average ticket price and drive incremental adjusted ebitda while still providing a great value to our customers and winwin revenue shares arrangements with our studio partners ensured that both parties benefited from our investment in the theatrical experience an incredible  million came from concession revenue growth net of concession cost our rollout of new menu items and alcoholic beverage offerings combined with a continued focus on strategic price adjustments has resulted in concession per cap growth of  or just over  since  all of this growth while keeping a close eye on our costs and improving our concession margin by  basis points and not to be overlooked our other revenue streams contributed over  million of growth over the past five years revenues from our vendor marketing arrangements our gift card and bulk ticket programs and our advanced ticketing platforms all experienced high growth rates with very little impact on our cost structure all told our total revenue net of variable cost has grown by approximately  million since  as compared to an increase of less than  million in our operational and administrative cost over that same time period the resulting  million increase in adjusted ebitda represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately  and margin expansion of  basis points all achieved without a meaningful change in our attendance we highlight these accomplishments for one simple reason we believe that our strategic initiatives and operational discipline combined with our proven track record of effectively allocating capital in ways that best benefit our longterm shareholders all contributed to our success over the past five years and we are optimistic that these positive trends will continue to benefit our customers and our shareholders well into the future our studio partners commitment to and investment in theatrical content is robust and the film slate looks very solid for the foreseeable future our customer amenity initiatives both at the auditorium and at the concession stand still have room to run and well bring them to more and more customers over the next several years our customer engagement strategies through the regal crown club our mobile app and our ticketing partners have the potential to increase frequency and spend among our very best customers and all of these contribute to our expectations for continued success and should produce meaningful upside for our shareholders for the next several years were obviously proud of our past results and it should be noted we are equally optimistic regarding our future with that ill turn the presentation over to david for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial performance david h ownby  regal entertainment group thanks amy and good afternoon everyone for the next few minutes ill provide a brief analysis of our fourth quarter results and an update with respect to our balance sheet asset base and capital structure we generated total fourth quarter revenues of  million including  million of box office revenue  million of concession sales and  million of other operating revenue our admissions revenue for the quarter fell by approximately  in the aggregate as an average ticket price increase of  simply couldnt offset the industry attendance decline in the face of last years recordsetting film slate that difficult comparison was most evident at our large format imax and rpx auditoriums which saw perscreen revenue fall by over  excluding these  screens our perscreen box office revenue fell by only  our concession revenue decreased by  in the aggregate but grew by  on a perattendee basis while the per cap continued to benefit from both strategic price increases and the continued rollout of our expanded menu and alcoholic beverage offerings overall unit volumes for both beverages and popcorn declined slightly in the face of a very difficult comparison and limited our fourth quarter per cap growth other operating revenues grew by over  million as compared to the same period last year driven primarily by an increase in revenues associated with our gift card and bulk ticket programs and the continued success of our online and mobile ticketing platforms over the course of  almost onefifth of our admissions revenue was generated via an online or mobile transaction our film and advertising expense of  million represented  of admissions revenue a  basis point improvement versus the same period last year due primarily to a film slate that was somewhat less reliant on one or two high grossing films our  concession margin declined by  basis points as compared to the same period last year but remained in line with the recent historical average normal increases in packaged goods and raw material costs and minor changes in product mix both contributed to the quarteroverquarter increase and both rent expense and other operating expenses remained relatively flat in total but increased by approximately  on a perscreen basis the former due to normal inflationary increases and the impact of landlord construction incentives and the latter due to minor increases in theaterlevel payroll costs we are extremely pleased that despite the difficult comparison with last years record fourth quarter our strategic and operational execution produced  basis points of adjusted ebitda margin growth and fourth quarter total revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share that are well ahead of consensus wall street estimates as for our asset base capital expenditures net of asset sales and landlord contributions for the quarter totaled  million bringing our fullyear total to  million and we continued to actively manage our asset base opening two new auditoriums at an existing theater and closing four theaters and  screens to end the year with  theaters and  screens in light of our ongoing focus on premium customer amenities we expect our  capital expenditures net of asset sales and landlord contributions to be between  million and  million in the coming year we expect to open three to five new theaters with  to  screens and close  to  theaters with  to  screens which would result in ending counts of approximately  theaters and  screens for  in addition given our current asset base and capital expenditure guidance we expect full year depreciation expense of between  million and  million in  and with respect to our capital structure we ended the quarter with over  million in cash and approximately  billion in total debt absent any significant changes in our debt profile we expect interest expense of approximately  million in  in closing we are pleased that our strategic and operational execution our investment in premium amenities and a healthy box office environment led to a solid fourth quarter and a record year in  and we remain excited about the opportunity for more of the same in  operator this concludes our prepared remarks and we can now open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of julia yue of jpmorgan please proceed with your question julia yue  jpmorgan securities llc thank you i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what drove the big increase in other revenues this quarter against the very tough comp last year how much of this was from the higher advanced ticketing sales that you mentioned and should we expect them to remain elevated for the next couple quarters as well david h ownby  regal entertainment group thanks julia the biggest component of that relates to our gift card and the revenues associated with our gift card and bulk ticket programs those programs have – particularly the gift cards have continued to grow over the last few years and really two things that kind of impact the revenue that we recognize in a given period one is our sales history and the other is the redemption pattern and both of those have been in our favor for this past year and particularly in this quarter a smaller piece of that – you mentioned the advanced ticketing platforms it was another great quarter from an advanced ticketing perspective i think about  of our sales in q were via our online or mobile platforms and that number has continued to grow really the trend line has been – that number was kind of in the midteens – low teens im sorry for the first part of  obviously it spiked up in q of last year with the force awakens first three quarters of this year it was kind of in the midtohigh teens   of our sales and then jumped up again to about  in q and certainly wed expect that number to continue to grow in the future as we roll out more and more recliner screens julia yue  jpmorgan securities llc got it and i was also hoping to get some clarity on the recent expanded deal that you signed with imax particularly are these screens being installed in those  markets that dont have any pls offerings are they more add on and i also think the screens are supposed to be installed in a mix of both new and existing theaters over the next couple years any clarity on what that mix is and what the expected pace of installation is supposed to be would be really helpful david h ownby  regal entertainment group yeah julia i dont have those specific numbers in front of me but you are correct its a mix of new theaters and existing theaters and same thing a mix of some markets that will be getting their first imax screen and others that already have some other imax or pls screen in the market that arrangement we felt like was a winwin for us and for imax it expanded our footprint made some minor changes to the economics in the deal i think in the long run benefit both of us and so yes we were excited to get that signed up julia yue  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of ben mogil of stifel please proceed with your question benjamin mogil  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question so amy thank you very much for sort of that overview and giving a sense of where all the growth has come from so theres two questions sort of tied to – or one question tied to capex given that youre seeing very good returns on the recliners in terms of concession buys online ticketing et cetera wondering why you dont sort of accelerate the capex in  amy e miles  regal entertainment group ben if you go back and you look at it this over time as it relates to our plans for  just a couple of things we expect to meet our initial goal of being to  of the circuit by the end of  which we announced several years ago as well as were proud to recently announce that we felt like that we had probably an incremental  to  of the circuit from an opportunity perspective so lets call that more like  to  as we start into  but one of the key things with respect to our rollout its dependent upon some of the landlord financing that has made a lot of these investments very accretive and so we just want to make sure that we also have the time to work with our landlord partners to make sure that we continue to do or make these investments in a very accretive and prudent way benjamin mogil  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thats great thank you and then sort of the good news obviously is youre getting much more ebitda per patron but the patronage is flat what do you think can help grow patronage again either regal or the ecosystem in general i mean clearly studios are putting out lots of movies and are doing lots of things what do you think helps grow the patronage number not necessarily this year but from a longerterm perspective amy e miles  regal entertainment group ben i think one of the great things for the industry today as we speak is youre seeing a – really a focus on changing the consumer experience and thats not just happening at regal but thats happening across the industry now were at a point where – im not sure exactly what the number is today but its probably less than  of the screens in the united states so lets call it  to  feature the luxury amenities so as we continue to invest and upgrade the experience i think thats going to go a long way to growing the overall industry pie and i guess the way that we think about it at regal is even if the industry pie stays flat over time were going to be very successful we demonstrated that from just in our results from  to  a lot of that is going to be an acquisition strategy that we believe were going to be able to execute coupled with our own investment in premium amenities across our asset base so i do believe theres upside in attendance but even if that doesnt happen i think were going to be very successful with our own initiative getting a bigger piece of that industry pie benjamin mogil  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thanks amy and i just wanted to followup on something you mentioned with the landlords and working with them to be supportive for landlords who have malls that have a lot of department stores which have clearly been under a lot of pressure from a traffic perspective are you seeing those landlords be sort of extra interested in talking to you are you seeing any kind of traffic loss at venues where the department stores are really under pressure and youre enforcing  collateral damage with that kind of curious if youre seeing sort of a similar kind of divergence or any kind of trends you can talk about amy e miles  regal entertainment group you know whats interesting there ben and this has been true for a long time a lot of times what you see in these developments is theaters are drivers of traffic not necessarily beneficiaries of traffic so where youre seeing some of the decline from a retail perspective were not feeling that in our mall locations just if we compare our mall location to another theater in the same market were not seeing a negative impact on the luxury side where we are seeking landlord investment with respect to investing in the new theater – im sorry investing in the luxury or premium amenities that excitement has not waned at all so weve been doing this now  through – and we have our deals in place for  and theres still a robust marketplace for landlord participation these are just theaters they would like to have in their sights benjamin mogil  stifel nicolaus  co inc and even in malls where there are some challenges youre still seeing a lack of interest from them amy e miles  regal entertainment group thats correct benjamin mogil  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thats great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of robert fishman of moffettnathanson please proceed with your question robert fishman  moffettnathanson hi good afternoon one for amy and one for david if i can amy given kevin tsujiharas comments on the time warner earnings call earlier this week about making a lot of progress on the pvod window conversation can you just update us from your perspective how the conversations have been going with warner brothers or other studios on the window changes amy e miles  regal entertainment group you know i guess just to put it in context well i guess some may believe this is a public discussion or negotiation i think we think its best to address it privately with our studio partners and when theres something tangible to disclose well do that but today there just isnt anything tangible to disclose now that being said we do continue to believe that its in the best interest of exhibition as well as our studio partners to develop a strategy with respect to any changes in distribution for the ancillary market thats mutually beneficial and i think it is worth noting that weve heard that same sentiment from not just one but several of our studio partners and just to be clear our position hasnt changed weve said many times that we were open to any idea or potential changes in the model that one have the potential to grow the overall pie and two any kind of associated economic arrangement would provide us with appropriate longterm financial participation that hasnt changed from our perspective and the only thing ill add and i know im stating kind of the obvious here with this addon comment but as weve just rolled off or completed two phenomenal box office years and you think about the next several years they look great from a theatrical perspective what i am confident about is that our studio partners are not looking for ways at all to denigrate that theatrical box office or that experience robert fishman  moffettnathanson okay thank you david can i just followup on amys earlier comments on the landlord contributions for your full year capex guidance can you share with us the underlying gross capex expectations or just broadly speaking if you expect landlord contributions to increase compared to last year david h ownby  regal entertainment group i think robert and to be fair were still working out some of those deals particularly for the latter part of this year but it will look somewhat similar to this year where we had i think about  million  million of landlord contributions on top of our  million of net capex so thats what  million  million of total dollars in the ground robert fishman  moffettnathanson okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of eric wold of b riley financial please proceed with your question eric wold  b riley  co llc thank you good afternoon two questions one followon on the last question around the studio discussions of windows i know amy mentioned that its not something you want to discuss kind of publicly but kind of thinking kind of larger picture conceptually i know youve talked about maybe one of the more attractive opportunities is tackling that dark period between the main theatrical window and i guess the initial home video window and thinking about your comments that no one wants to do anything to negatively impact theatrical boxoffice all the tests so far that have been done by the studio it was kind of on early releases have been done one could argue maybe with movies that no one really wanted to see anyway and so maybe theyre not kind of legitimate tests if you will in terms of demand how does someone take that leap either the studio side or the exhibitor side to test a major film or a very attractive property not knowing whats going to happen and not risking damaging kind of that theatrical window or kind of consumers perception amy e miles  regal entertainment group yeah eric i mean i could just step back and say broadly to answer that question is thats why i think you see both sides approaching this discussion and any potential tests or whatever you want to call it with respect to the distribution model very prudently and very methodically because what no one wants to see happen on either side is like i said any kind of denigration in box office particularly when youre in a period where youre seeing such high  performance and high growth from a theatrical perspective so just given that backdrop i do think that youre going to see conversations around potential solutions that are very mindful of ways to try to grow the overall pie and not cannibalize the existing theatrical business that doesnt make economic sense for either one of us eric wold  b riley  co llc okay and then just one followup question on the reseat initiatives and now that youve kind of committed to kind of getting to that   level by the end of  as youve looked at other opportunities and identified the theaters that could fit the mold and hybrid theaters and whatnot kind of bridge this gap so amc just in their filing the other day for the offering they mentioned they want to get to  of their original legacy amc theaters  to be reseated by the end of  and i dont want you to speak for them but is that merely a timing issue in that they started this process earlier than regal and others or is there a marked  difference in terms of strategy in terms of where youd want to go what theaters you think are reasonable return hurdles whatever may be that would not allow you to get even close to that  and  is more of your ceiling david h ownby  regal entertainment group yeah eric obviously i cant speak for amc so i cant necessarily address what their strategy is and exactly how it compares to ours obviously theres difference in our asset bases theres difference in our geographies so that very well could be some of the difference i think from our perspective it will strictly be a return decision if we get to the end of our  and we believe there are still opportunities out there to generate a return then certainly we will continue to do that looking ahead three years right now i think we feel very confident that that number is at least  i would probably continue to think about that as a floor and not a ceiling though eric wold  b riley  co llc okay thats helpful thanks david operator our next question comes from the line of chad beynon of macquarie please proceed with your question chad beynon  macquarie capital usa inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions first i wanted to talk about capital allocation your payout ratio david has been in the lows and you gave guidance for capex for  which is pretty manageable and you also gave us your cash balance so how should we think about payout ratio given fairly low capex needs for  a good cash position and a pretty good outlook for the business for  and  david h ownby  regal entertainment group chad we wont think about capital allocation any differently you know our history there weve done i think a good job of balancing investing in our circuit via capex and acquisitions with also providing a meaningful shareholder return i think thatll continue to be our plan longterm obviously right here in nearterm we believe that we have a lot of highreturn quick payback projects at our disposal and we want to make sure we avail ourselves of those we believe those will create immediate value for our shareholders and obviously they also serve to help us generate more cash which is clearly a highclass problem because then we have more cash to allocate but over the long term that philosophy youve seen us employ over the last  years or so as a public company will continue to be our philosophy going forward chad beynon  macquarie capital usa inc okay thanks and then on the acquisition profile amy you mentioned that you do still have a plan to acquire more assets has anything really changed in terms of the synergies that youre underwriting internally when you look at some of these assets given national cinemedias stake or i guess just kind of thinking about how synergies have changed over the past  years in the space anything that would cause you to be more cautious on the multiples that youre seeing these assets listed at amy e miles  regal entertainment group no i mean i think when you think about the historical synergies we would expect to be able to repeat those in the future the only thing that i can say we do believe has changed is obviously to the extent that we add screens to the asset base it allows us the opportunity to bring the premium amenities to a wider base of theaters so i would say that would be my only perspective of change in synergies since maybe our most recent acquisitions with hollywood and great escape chad beynon  macquarie capital usa inc okay thanks congrats on the record year amy e miles  regal entertainment group thank you david h ownby  regal entertainment group thank you operator our next question comes from the line of tony wible of drexel hamilton please proceed with your question tony wible  drexel hamilton llc thanks i had two questions one is it conceivable that you guys may participate in any kind of early vod window thats being discussed i mean is that something thats in the realm of possibility and the second question is i guess you guys have been shrinking the theater count now for about three years when would you expect that to stabilize and start to go the other way and as part of that when you guys are closing is there any kind of recapture at neighboring theaters or are these theaters so spread apart that its difficult to recapture some of those patrons from a closed theater thanks amy e miles  regal entertainment group yeah ill take the window question first i wouldnt speculate today on our participation on any kind of theoretic any idea thats presented to us again we would evaluate and weve spelled out the criteria that we think are important so but other than that theres no way i could speculate on any kind of just theoretics david h ownby  regal entertainment group and tony as for the theater count you are correct it has declined a little bit over the last few years some of that is simply the fact that weve focused most of our capex dollars on refurbing existing theaters as opposed to our new build pipeline that i think this year we said wed open three to five new theaters with about give or take  screens or so offset that with just a few more closures than that so that i guess decline rate is slowing as we get to the recliner initiative or at least the meaty part of the recliner initiative between now and  you will see some of those dollars revert back to new builds and at some point i would expect that youll see the screen count either flatten out or start to grow and of course i am speaking here organically obviously to the extent we signed accretive acquisition opportunities then we have historically grown our screen count in bunches through acquisition tony wible  drexel hamilton llc and are you closing screens that are close enough together  david h ownby  regal entertainment group yes tony its marketbymarket certainly that does happen sometimes where we can close an older theater and drive traffic to one of our other locations but thats a very marketspecific or local marketspecific question tony wible  drexel hamilton llc great thank you david h ownby  regal entertainment group thank you operator our next question comes from the line of david miller of loop capital markets please proceed with your question david w miller  loop capital markets llc yeah thanks for taking the question dave just a question on ma just if you can answer it as best you can obviously you may know that amc per doj decree has to sell between  and  theaters as part of the agreement with the department of justice visàvis its carmike acquisition my understanding from the amc side is that they have a choice in each of these markets to sell either the amc asset or i guess it would be the examc asset or the excarmike asset if they choose to sell all examc assets rather than the excarmike assets is that something that you would take a look at or is that something that you feel your theater count is pretty full right now just given your capex guidance that you talked about in your prepared remarks thanks a lot david h ownby  regal entertainment group yeah david i think you know our history obviously we try to look at anything and everything thats out there and available as for this specific transaction i couldnt comment one way or the other on it david w miller  loop capital markets llc okay fair enough thank you david h ownby  regal entertainment group thank you operator our next question comes from the line of barton crockett of fbr capital markets please proceed with your question zack silver  fbr capital markets  co hey guys this is zack silver on the line for barton i just had two questions the first one i was wondering if you could comment on your potential interest in ncmi shares to be sold by amc as part of its carmike acquisition and also your commitment to holding on to those shares that you have and then i guess the second one is a bit of a housekeeping question i was wondering if you could just give the ticket prices this year last year for imax d and standard thank you very much david h ownby  regal entertainment group yeah zack ill take that second one first in the fourth quarter our d average ticket price was  thats up  from a year ago our imax average ticket price was  thats up  from a year ago and our d ticket price was  and thats up from  a year ago amy e miles  regal entertainment group ill go ahead and take the question with respect to national cinemedia weve talked a lot today about all the opportunities that we have to invest our capital in what we think are very accretive projects so its hard for me to imagine that the opportunity with respect to the purchase of national cinemedia would outpace some of the other opportunities or maybe a better way to say that would come ahead or outperform some of the other opportunities that we have with respect to our capital today zack silver  fbr capital markets  co okay great thank you very much thats very helpful operator our next question comes from the line of jim goss from barrington research please proceed with your question james charles goss  barrington research associates inc thanks a couple of them one i know david youve told me a lot of times that there are plenty of opportunities in the us for acquisitions so you wouldnt really be thinking of outside the us but amy earlier on you were talking about the benefits youve gained in your existing operations despite attendance being sort of flattish over the period of time and there are a number of international markets where attendance is actually more on a growth curve i wonder if there would ever be any thought of reconsidering that position david h ownby  regal entertainment group yes and jim i think our position there really hasnt changed obviously were a known acquirer in the business and in the industry and we look at opportunities both here and abroad when we think about how we prioritize those uses of capital – obviously we talked a lot today about the highreturn highpayback projects that we have in front of us with the recliners – obviously youve historically seen us acquire theaters in the us and we get a great deal of synergy value out of those acquisitions and we certainly still believe there are more of those to be done in the us and then of course there the acquisitions you talked about around the world – but when we prioritize those were always going to prioritize those based on return and the dynamics that go with each individual opportunity are going to determine where we place our efforts and where we place our priorities and todate weve had plenty of opportunities and quite frankly believe we still have plenty of opportunities to generate a very high rate of return here in the us well always look and well always be interested in those opportunities around the world but well always prioritize those based on return james charles goss  barrington research associates inc okay and then the other area im wondering about is your loyalty program and the information you would get from the loyalty program since that seems to be the key benefit just wondering if the information has provided any surprises or any key takeaways you might talk about and are there any actions youve taken that have resulted as from your taking a look at your loyalty program information amy e miles  regal entertainment group yeah i cant speak to any surprises the one thing i will say i think its made us much more effective with respect to how we target and speak to our most loyal most frequent customers one thing i can say is several years ago we shifted away from communicating based on demographics and communicating and providing offers based on your actual moviegoing habits which may not necessarily match your demographic profile so i think the best learning from the loyalty program has been a more efficient marketing platform with respect to the customers that have an affinity for the regal brand james charles goss  barrington research associates inc okay well that is a pretty interesting takeaway i think so thanks very much amy e miles  regal entertainment group thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matthew harrigan of wunderlich securities incorporated please proceed with your question matthew j harrigan  wunderlich securities inc thank you two things one can you comment on atom ticketing and any possibilities for dynamic pricing over a period of time i mean that seems like something that could be pretty interesting in the longer term and then secondly this is a really hypothetical question but even though youre not involved in international markets im sure you monitor what goes on there what windows and distribution and i guess in a lot of these markets i mean youre not going to see any innovation in germany or italy or something like that but if you really look at the chinese market and maybe the composition of the studio revenue fee is very different more oriented towards streaming less oriented towards box office over time and possibly thats providing an alternative template i mean do you see any developments there and do you think there could be any flowback into the us market in terms of how people look at the proposition of windows i know its kind of a fuzzy question but i thought id ask it anyway david h ownby  regal entertainment group matt ill take the question about atom tickets obviously were excited about our partnership there and as we are with our other ticketing partners and right now i think their focus is very clearly as it should be on customer acquisition and trying to grow their business and make sure they can participate in the overall growth of the online ticketing market any other discussions about different pricing models and whether its dynamic pricing or whatever the model may be i think those are probably well in the future for those ticketing partners as i said right now theyre just very focused on customer acquisition and making sure they can participate in the growth of that market amy e miles  regal entertainment group and matthew ill follow up with respect to the second half of your question being a large exhibitor here in the united states we obviously have a lot of international contacts and have good relationships with a lot of the international operators of theater circuits so our team does spend a lot of time trying to evaluate best practices not just here in the united states but other opportunities that may present themselves from a global perspective as well so theres nothing that i have to disclose today with respect to those specific initiatives but we do spend a lot of time from an overall regal perspective considering enhancements to the movie going experience and we dont limit our perspective to just what were seeing here in the united states matthew j harrigan  wunderlich securities inc thanks amy thanks david congratulations on the numbers amy e miles  regal entertainment group thank you david h ownby  regal entertainment group thank you operator our next question comes from the line of leo kulp of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question leo kulp  rbc capital markets llc thank you good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions i just had one for amy and then two quick ones for david amy going back to your comments about the strength of the box office do you have any insight into whats driving it is it really just a slate or have you seen some evidence that the investments that the industry has made in improving the experience is driving attendance growth across the board amy e miles  regal entertainment group yeah i think its a combination of both weve obviously had a very solid film slate with a lot of films that were commercially appealing over the past couple of years i think thats going to continue on into the future and as weve looked at our investment with respect to the premium amenities weve continued to be pleased with the results that were seeing and we do have not many markets today but several large markets boston is a good example where today over  of the box office in boston is generated by theaters with premium amenities so for a big market in a big city  thats a solid number and what weve seen in boston is an outperformance in the boston box office as compared to the national average so that gives us a lot of comfort that these investments in premium amenities not only are appealing to customers but they are providing incremental growth in box office and attendance david h ownby  regal entertainment group and leo ill just add to that and as i said this has evolved over the last several years but i think now more than ever before the studios have been willing to utilize almost every part of the calendar for their releases and i think thats been a positive overall for box office trends as well leo kulp  rbc capital markets llc got it thank you and then david two quick ones for you first can you talk about the contribution margin on the other revenue id imagine thats pretty high and then also could you give a little color around the drivers of concessions per cap growth david h ownby  regal entertainment group sure leo the contribution margin you are correct on other revenue it is pretty significant a lot of those revenues – remember the big items there are vendor marketing revenue the revenue thats associated with our gift card and our bulk ticket programs revenue from our ticketing platforms a lot of those dont have i guess significant below the line costs associated with them so anytime were able to grow those revenues its very accretive to the bottom line and i think amy mentioned some of that in her prepared remarks how the growth rate weve experienced there over the last five years and that has been meaningful for us on the per cap growth for the quarter typically we break that down into three buckets for you and i think i talked a little bit about those in the prepared remarks too but just to put some numbers to it the pricing on our core items got us about  of per cap growth the food and alcohol rollout got us an additional  and then that was offset as i mentioned by a bit of a decline in our beverage and popcorn volume that offset was about  to get you to the net of  and that decline in the volume really i think is just related a little bit to the film slate we had a really monster volume in q of last year and that often time happens when you have a real event picture like the force awakens and i think this year it was just tough for the per cap to keep pace with that leo kulp  rbc capital markets llc got it thank you very much david h ownby  regal entertainment group thank you operator our next question comes from the line of omar sheikh of the credit suisse group please proceed with your question omar sheikh  credit suisse securities usa llc i nearly got the name right good evening everyone ive just got three questions a couple for david and one for amy if possible david first of all i just wondered if i could just look at the adjusted ebitda reconciliation which you put into the release there is a number of about  million for cash distributions and other nonconsolidated entities i wonder whether you could just explain what that is i havent seen that before that would be helpful and then secondly for david youve talked before or both of you talked before about the irrs youve been getting on the recliner and food and beverage investment on the new theaters that you are refurbishing i wonder whether you could just sort of comment on the trends that youve seen in the last quarter on that front and then if i could just add one for amy going back to the premium vod issue i dont know whether you might be able to just give us some sense of how broadbased the discussions with studio partners are at this point because obviously weve heard from three of the studios but obviously notably disney hasnt really been very public about this and i just wondered whether specifically youd be able to confirm or not that disney are also included in the conversations thank you amy e miles  regal entertainment group no theres nothing that we could confirm or disclose today because just as i tried to convey in my beginning comments theres not a tangible model that we could discuss for you today so any kind of proposals that are just out in the marketplace were not going to provide any comments david h ownby  regal entertainment group and omar with respect to your other two questions the  million that you noted in the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we have multiple joint venture partners fathom dcip dcdc and from time to time we do get cash ill call them cash dividends or cash distributions returns on our equity investments in those ventures and when we receive those in cash we include those in adjusted ebitda and thats the number youre seeing there for the fourth quarter and then as for the irrs on the recliner projects i think weve talked about before that they cover a big range and that depends a lot on what the landlord involvement is i think the range over time has been somewhere – the low end has been about  irr at the pretax irr number the high end has been north of  the sweet spot is kind of in that  to  irr range excuse me and that number has been pretty consistent from the time we started the recliner project a couple of years ago up through this most recent quarter omar sheikh  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thats clear and sorry just on the cash distributions again are you expecting any material number in  david h ownby  regal entertainment group omar i expect over time we will continue to get distributions from those different joint venture entities the exact timing of those is tough to pinpoint omar sheikh  credit suisse securities usa llc thank you very much operator there are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference i would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks amy e miles  regal entertainment group thank you for joining us and we look forward
