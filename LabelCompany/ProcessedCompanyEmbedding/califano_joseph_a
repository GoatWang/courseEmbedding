and sullivan urge tobacco products scientific advisory committee to ban menthol cigarettes october   joseph a califano jr chairman and founder of casacolumbia casa at columbia university and former us secretary of health education and welfare and louis w sullivan md a casa board member and former us secretary of health and human services said that they strongly support a us food and drug administration ban on menthol in cigarettes earlier this year sullivan and califano asked the tobacco products scientific advisory committee to recommend that the fda ban menthol in cigarettes “it is no secret that blacks have long been targeted by marketing campaigns for menthol cigarettes a strategy that has been proven disturbingly effective almost  blacks die each year from smoking related diseases and thousands more are crippled by smoking related ailments more black women get lung cancer than breast cancer and black men are  more likely to get lung cancer compared to white men” said sullivan “masking the harsh flavor and burn of tobacco with a cool minty taste is a surefire way to get children to begin to smoke which is particularly troubling because  of smokers aged  to  and  of black or african american smokers age  or older are smoking menthol cigarettes and we know that  of adult smokers were hooked as teens” said califano “we are disappointed that these organizations that have supported civil rights for black americans have issued statements asking the food and drug administration to continue to allow the tobacco industry to prey on black americans by marketing menthol cigarettes to them it is crucial that the tobacco products scientific advisory committee recommend that menthol be banned from cigarettes for the health and safety of all americans but especially for black americans” added califano and sullivan as former us secretaries of health both califano and sullivan are very conscious of the fact that tobacco addiction disproportionately affects minority populations and have been trying to diminish the marketing of the tobacco industry to blacks and have written opeds addressing the tobacco industry’s targeting the black community with menthol
