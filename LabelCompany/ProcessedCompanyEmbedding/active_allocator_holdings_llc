digital financial advice platforms roboadvice and digital investment managers we assist you to sift through carefully generated choices to create timely specific and actionable recommendations we working with and for you forever transform how your retail clients allocate to and implement actively managed portfolios improves long term strategic asset allocation it has long been widely recognized that the majority of investment returns come from long term asset class strategic asset allocation decisions this simple boring yet extremely powerful insight is unfortunately often glossed over in obsessive search for ‘best products’ or the next hot investment theme the asset allocation module within our portal optimizes on what your client already owns it analyzes your clients aggregate portfolio does a riskreturn based analysis generates numbers and metrics and makes recommendations to reallocate asset classes to improve the portfolio in other cases it suggests the addition of other asset classes such as alternative investments to complement and enhance existing holdings we recognize as you undoubtedly do too yourself that any long term strategic asset allocation or a particular fund recommendation is made at a snapshot in time in the real world your clients circumstances evolve and change continually periodic rebalancing that comes at a price may or may not be an option while many are anchored in a long term view most investors would benefit from refreshing a dated investment allocation model revisit funds that they have allocated to in the past as well as act on changes in markets and include their future assumptions until now this however has been easier said than done for instance each wealth management firm each wire house often each broker dealer periodically arrives at their own future view of asset class expected risk and return yet financial advisors have no easy way to test such comparative views within the specific context of their particular client activeallocator allows you to do this in minutes our portal helps you quickly simulate such scenarios and allows you to quantify revision in views triggering valuable dialog activeallocator in minutes helps you in establishing detailed standardized assessments of your clients existing holdings you will be able to quickly incorporate your clients preferences to develop

to increase the frequency of interactions that your clients have with you  through real time collaboration generating and discussing what if scenarios on the fly in your meetings changing preexisting assumptions on an asset class or a funds future expected risk and return and modeling it as you converse this deepens customer intimacy you benefit along with your clients for such collaboration

financial advisor use in realtime and in the context of a business process the traditional system of record of client portfolio holdings now becomes a system of actionable new investment insight these insights are gleaned from predictive analytics which drives nearly all aspects of its recommendations there is a scarcity of good tools to analyze alternative investments given the absence of standards and recognized benchmarks in the alternative investments space fund investors often lack meaningful performance comparison metrics our portal brings in best practices utilized by the most sophisticated institutional investors to the affluent and mass affluent main street investor our proprietary analytical tools and models will help you better support your clients these include new approaches to alternative asset allocation activeallocator uses multivariable stochastic alternative asset models that go beyond the traditional markowitz meanvariance approach or the treynorblack approach or popular variants of the modified blacklitterman approach for instance allocations may be optimized to have the highest return per unit of specified risk constraint considerations may include investor preferences reducing volatility left skew excess kurtosis maximum drawdown whilst reducing corner solutions new approaches to investing and funds analysis activeallocator is able to extract information from proprietary databases of historical returns performance which serve as input to our stochastic manager selection models it answers questions such as the amount to allocate to single or to multimanager funds choice of fund categories optimum mix of skills based and cheap market beta exposure amongst others models for performance measurement and benchmarking activeallocator algorithms use a variety of means for performance analysis time series and cross sectional peer group comparison estimating measurement error alpha skills attribution the effects of leverage as well as customized performance analysis as you begin using this portal we urge you to contrast this to prevalent simplistic asset allocation approaches we believe that approaches often built off simply

intended to be used a strategicgenerally longer than a five yearinvestment horizon the model does not favor certain securities asset classes or managers over others the results of this optimization

allocator inc the model does not account for taxation does not offer tax advice and urges you to consult a tax advisor for specific advice about the tax implications of an investment portfolio the model does not consider all investment opportunities available to investors other investments not considered may have characteristics similar or superior to those analyzed by the model partial list of assumptions assumption — this model including the constraints and these assumptions is suggestive and may not be appropriate for all assumption — the model outputs are intended to be merely guidelines for asset allocation and should be used to facilitate yours’ and your financial advisor’s judgment and not as a substitute for the exercise of that judgment assumption — your asset allocation guidelines are highly dependent on the financial assumptions that are made for purposes of developing these guidelines we have used the pretax forecasts for returns historical risks and correlations with assumptions assumption — for purposes of deriving correlations among the various asset classes we used between  and  years of data based on our assessment of a range of factors for each asset class including but not limited to data availability stability of parameters and length of the investment cycle assumption — the model relies on index data for many asset classes indices are unmanaged and investors cannot invest directly in an index a variety of factors may cause an index to be an inaccurate benchmark for an asset class or particular investment within an asset class in certain cases the data has been adjusted for certain structural biases in the indices such as serial correlation and reporting biases in addition adjustments for fees have also been made based on approximations actual fees will vary for particular investments a number of other estimates have also been made assumption — the guidelines are intended for use as a strategic as opposed to tactical allocation and should be evaluated over a minimum  year timeframe assumption — we generally assume that there is an ongoing ability to rebalance positions for traditional investments including for liquid alternatives emulating hedged exposures’ except for managed futures generally monthly ability to rebalance hedge funds generally quarterly ability to rebalance and private equity and real estate generally no ability to rebalance regardless of these constraints on the model you should regularly rebalance your overall portfolio when possible assumption — you should review and assess the constraints imposed on the asset allocation guidelines proposed for you assumption — the model assumes that you hold a sufficiently diversified set of investments within each asset class so as to correlate closely enough to the index chosen for the asset class in order to effectively implement the asset allocation guidelines although the determination of whether the investments in an asset class are “sufficiently diversified” will be a function of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding your specific investments investors should strive to ensure that a investments in a given asset class represent the subasset classes or strategies contained in that asset class this can include but is not limited to diversification across geographies trading strategies sectors and in the case of real estate and private equity vintage years in addition for real estate investors should consider diversification across major property types such as retail multifamily office and industrial the model uses multiple underlying types of fixed income to characterize structured credit strategies municipals mortgages bank loans and preferred investors who invest in this asset class should also consider diversification across these collateral types and explore corporate lending b investments in a given asset class are spread across enough managers such that no one manager dominates the overall risk of that asset class the number of managers to be sufficiently diversified depends on the size of the managers as well as on how closely the managers resemble one another and how closely they resemble the index for their asset class the model assumes that traditional asset classes are represented by passive investments in representative indices which provide inherent diversification at any time there is no certainty that products sufficiently diverse to meet these standards will be available even when they are actual performance of the products may vary significantly from the index thus diminishing the effectiveness of the allocation assumption — other than the constraints that you have provided the model does not take into account specific aspects of your financial situation such as your preference for liquidity cash flow requirements or costs of rebalancing your portfolio assumption — the model only considers the types of investments listed in the tables in developing your asset allocation guidelines assumption — we assume that real estate allocations are immediately fully invested although unlike in non traded reits these investments are typically staged over an extended period of several typically three years assumption — probabilities are calculated using a normal distribution ie a symmetric bellshaped distribution which should be viewed as an approximation only and not as a precise reflection of the true structure of possible outcomes probabilities of achieving multiyear returns are based on a lognormal distribution these probabilities assume that the portfolio is being continuously rebalanced and that there are no withdrawals these assumptions are approximations only and therefore the probabilities should be treated as estimates actual probabilities may vary based on the appropriateness of these assumptions in the optimization we have used mean variance skewness kurtosis maximum draw down and tested against mvar assumption — you should review the classification of your current portfolio to ensure you are in agreement differences in categorization can have a material effect on the asset allocation active allocator inc makes no representations concerning the characterization of the current portfolio or its valuation assumption — we have not made assumptions about indicative fee levels which may vary depending on a range of factors including specific product selections time periods size of investments and performance indices for strategic asset allocation assumptions all indexes are unmanaged and an individual cannot invest directly in an index index returns do not include fees or expenses equities the dow jones industrial average is a priceweighted average of  actively traded bluechip us stocks the msci

integrates traditional illiquid and alternative investments within portfolios the activeallocator difference brings institutional quality asset allocation methods to financial advisors who serve mainstream investors built around cutting edge algorithms and software developed by analysts who have been advisors themselves with decades of main and wall street experience far beyond anything offered by emerging digital financial advice platforms or robo advice assists financial advisors to develop and implement sound investment policies to deploy client capital sensibly augments financial advisor and client interactions by bringing in analytics driven fact based product agnostic decision making we are the rational alternative whilst recognizing comfort in past performance we do not place all our faith in it experience in itself is not good enough for us we do not drive all the way home by looking at the rear view mirror neither we hope would you we believe that a factbased approach to investment allocation decisions is often missing in the alternative investments space we are in a sense the “rational alternative“ many of you who invest in alternative investments have a difficult task given lack of transparency in investing given asymmetric information differentiating between results that come from active skills or passive market exposure properly integrating illiquid and liquid investments together absence of analytic tools to arrive at fact based decisions stale prices and subjective asset valuation constrained access to excellent fund managers these challenges are compounded when it comes to investing across a broad range of strategies asset types managers styles and instruments that constitute the alternative investments universe choices choices choices especially wellsuited for alternative investments activeallocator accounts for stale pricing in traditional investing returns are accurate largely marked to market in alternative investments returns for many strategies are not marked to market daily activeallocator algorithms correct data for stale pricing unique risks in traditional investing volatility is an appropriate risk measure as returns data is bell shapednormally distributed this is not so within alternative investing where volatility may misrepresent true risk activeallocator algorithms correct data to arrive at better measures of underlying risk for instance it incorporates extreme but rare downside events illiquidity in traditional investing typically assets are highly liquid as they are traded continuously in markets this is not so in alternative investments where different levels of liquidity restrict exit options activeallocator algorithms make an illiquidity premium adjustment inefficient markets in traditional investing typically assets are traded in efficient public markets whereas alternative investments are often traded in private markets activeallocator algorithms take asymmetric information into consideration and attenuate style drift in long dated investments strategy heterogeneity in traditional investing unlike in alternative investments there is greater homogeneity between sub asset classes activeallocator algorithms are built to resolve greater heterogeneity in substrategies reporting bias in traditional investing one does not have to worry about reporting bias within alternative investments reporting biases create distortion in performance data for example fund managers may cease reporting typically due to poor performance leading to survivorship bias another example is selection bias where a database incorporates the performance of fund managers who choose to report managers who perform better will typically be more likely to report creating an upward bias yet another example is short history bias shorter history may not accurately reflect longer term returns activeallocator algorithms address and resolve such biases serial correlation in returns in infrequently valued illiquid investments such as real estate or private equity serial correlation in returns data causes an understatement in volatility serial correlation occurs when returns are interdependent as opposed to being independent across time the result is risk is understated and the risk adjust return measure overstated also the true correlation between asset classes is altered activeallocator algorithms quantitatively adjust returns data using autoregression techniques to remove serial correlation nonnormal returns distributions in alternative investments illiquid and difficult to trade securities have unmeasured risk securities that are not consistently marked to marked understate risk or volatility moreover extreme event tail risk is difficult to quantify and downside risk capture is difficult to measure activeallocator algorithms are purpose built to address this and make provisions for left tail skew and kurtosis optimization style drift in alternative investments some hedge fund managers do not rigidly limit themselves to one strategy as they pursue market inefficiencies the flexibility to seek out investment opportunities is an advantage but such style drift also poses unique risks for investors activeallocator algorithms group strategies that are correlated as well as have similar statistical return characteristics into baskets to reduce the adverse effect of style drift in portfolios in summary… we help you cut through opacity fund manager claims investment industry jargon to see the investing world in simple terms we use our skills and
