in the final product product design for the environment cepheid has established formal programs to ensure products and packaging undergo design for environment dfe processes to minimize the use of hazardous materials and produce less packaging waste for the consumer additionally cepheid instrument takeback programs foster product lifecycle stewardship sustainable packaging practices have been successfully implemented by several approaches as follows elimination eliminated wood crates by using postconsumer recyclable cardboard for delivery of the genexpert system  eliminated the need for cold shipments of product by shipping at ambient temperatures coldpacks and styrofoam are no longer disposed as waste materials  eliminated the need to ship genexpert modules for calibration modules now undergo remote electronic calibration thus totally eliminating the environmental impact of using shipping materials and transportation for modules previously calibrated in sunnyvale we estimate  million kg of co no longer generated from module transportation reduction reduced nonrecyclable foil packaging  consumable product packaging was reduced  by redesigning the container this significantly reduced packaging materials consumption and transportation weight impact on the environment  the infinity and genexpert module transport package weight was redesigned to reduce shipping weight  and allow reuse of the container this reduces packaging materials consumption and transportation weight impact on the environment product environmental health and safety compliance the cepheid
