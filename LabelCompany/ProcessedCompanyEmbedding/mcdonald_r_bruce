chicago tribune business loss of mcdonalds contract puts small printer in danger john schmeltzertribune staff reporter for more than  years chicagos robert bruce co has been the sole supplier of stationery supplies and business cards for the giant mcdonalds corp and many of its franchisees its business relationship was based for much of that time upon a handshake with the oak brookbased companys founder ray kroc now in a struggle that pits david against the goliath the tiny south side company which last year received twothirds of its  million in sales from mcdonalds is fighting for its futureand has filed suit against the hamburger chain i cant understand why they want to destroy or bankrupt a small company said robert mendez who said the companys name is based upon his first name and the first name of his son bruce mendez in a lawsuit filed in cook county circuit court the company is seeking more than  million in damages including more than  to cover the cost of gift bags cards and various pieces of corporate stationery that robert bruce has been ordered to destroy im not sure we would have spent 0 last year developing a web site that permits them to order supplies electronically if i knew they were going to do this robert mendez said adding that employees are concerned about their future the relationship began unraveling in august when mcdonalds asked robert bruce to deliver  samples of several dozen items two months after the samples were delivered the mendezes said they learned mcdonalds was seeking bids for a new supplier despite assurances that they would be given an opportunity to bid their attorney zane smith says mcdonalds kept secret the awarding of the contract to a st paul firm until early january mcdonalds also formally terminated a trademark license that permitted the robert bruce firm to produce documents bearing mcdonalds worldfamous arches and other symbols and ordered the destruction of the warehouse inventory more puzzling smith said is that mcdonalds blocked robert bruce from continuing to do business with franchisees all of whom under their contracts can go to any supplier for their printing needs a spokesman for mcdonalds denied the company had acted improperly in terminating the robert bruce contract mcdonalds had a mutually beneficial business relationship with robert bruce and we made a business decision to terminate our contract with them and we terminated our contract properly said bill whitman a mcdonalds spokesman robert calvin a professor of entrepreneurship and marketing at the university of chicago graduate school of business said the plight facing the robert bruce firm is one other smallbusiness owners frequently face many small businesses are very dependent upon one or two customers calvin said one of the things we talk about is the need for smallbusiness owners to focus they cant be all things to all people so they have to target their customer and market he said but the flip side of that is that one of the major disadvantages of the strategy is their lack of diversification in either products or customers that is the situation now facing mendez and his son who said they were consumed with servicing their best customer finding new customers isnt going to be easy they said adding that they hope that mcdonalds will relent and allow them to sell to the franchise operators people dont send letters anymore said robert mendez noting that many companies and individuals are now relying almost entirely upon email this really is a dying industry copyright   chicago
