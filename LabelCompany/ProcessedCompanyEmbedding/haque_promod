faithventure capitalist promod haque – called by god to business venture capitalist promod haque – called by god to businessoctober  business leaders entrepreneurs and vcs reason and faith is business a calling  most of us are familiar with people being called by god to become ministers priests or into some other vocational ministry  but does god call some people to a career in business  top silicon valley venture capitalist promod haque believes god called him to a career in business but only after he first felt called to vocational ministry career crisis the year was   haque was ceo of a startup company in minnesota  three and a half years into his work the company was struggling  while haque was reconsidering his career decisions he became aware of the seeker church movement led by bill hybels of willow creek church a mega church located in suburban chicago  as a marketing guy haque sensed that god might be calling him into vocational ministry as a church planter he enrolled at bethel seminary in st paul in their part time mdiv program while continuing as ceo all went well at the seminary until he enrolled in a class on spiritual gifts  as part of that class he took a test to assess his strengths  the professor of the class called haque into his office to go over the test results  much to haque’s surprise the professor told haque “you have no pastoral gifts  you are a business guy and are in the wrong place”  haque comments “it was a blow to hear that  i was depressed and confused  i thought this is what god wanted me to do” haque admits he went through a tough couple of months asking god “what do you want me to do”  he sold his company to a larger company and started looking for jobs and found a position in venture capital with norwest venture partners in silicon valley it was the right fit norwest venture partners haque worked his way up at norwest to become a senior managing partner  in his  years with the firm haque has invested in over  companies producing more than  billion in exit value to date  more than  companies have gone public and many others have been acquired  in  forbes magazine recognized haque as a “hall of fame” investor  he has appeared on forbes’s annual midas list of top venture capitalists  times including in  when he was ranked as the “number one” venture capitalist reflecting on his career haque who is now in his s remarks “god helped and has blessed me in my career  i think that the professor at bethel was led by the lord to get the right message to me” his christian faith faith is central to haque’s life  he views god as is “his ceo” in his business and in his life he remarks i live by his rules and standards which are absolute  and i take issues like justice ethics honesty and integrity seriously  i work at my job as i am working for him not for men  and i fear him as that is the beginning of wisdom haque became a follower of christ at the age of  while in engineering school in india  he grew up in what he calls “a nominal christian family”  but at a youth for christ meeting god got his attention  a pastor challenged him to have a personal relationship with christ “i was convicted of my sins and recognized my need to have a savior who would forgive my sins” says haque  this led haque to investigate the evidence for faith to strengthen his commitment  he not only read the bible but also read history including jewish historian flavius josephus “the fact that jesus’s disciples were martyred for what they witnessed and believed was very convincing to me” says haque faith leads to action faith to haque is more than having a relationship with christ  looking back haque sees that god wanted him in the business and venture capital world  “but god also wanted me to serve him and to be a good steward of what he has given me” remarks haque “one of the things the lord impressed on me was that the wealth i receive is not for me to live a flamboyant lifestyle  he has a claim on it and wants me to give it away for ministry  that is what i am called to do” haque does not promote his generosity but when pressed admits that he gives to many causes including local and foreign charities engaged in discipleship evangelism and social justice  haque’s wife was brought up in a missionary family which served in africa  “she has interests in africa  i have interests in india and china” says haque  “we give to causes in those areas and give locally” haque is active in his church in los gatos and serves on the board of biola university other charities he supports include opportunity international which is focused on helping the poor and the international justice mission a usbased nonprofit organization helping abused people around the world advice to budding entrepreneurs haque has looked at numerous business plans met many entrepreneurs and sits on the boards of several companies  i asked haque what advice he would give to someone who wants to start a business  although businesses and individuals are different he emphasized these points do you have domain experience — “although there are exceptions when we invest we want to make sure the entrepreneur has relevant experience in the domain in which they plan to operate” is the product differentiated — “we invest in companies engaged in domains in which it is difficult for someone to do a ‘me too’ product we avoid companies and domains in which there are other ‘me too’ companies already operating  chances are that only two or three companies will succeed in a domain  others will fail” is there a team with complementary talent — “it is very difficult for one person to do everything  a marketing person teamed with a product person makes a good team  the product person knows how to build the product and the marketing person has the relationships and the talent to talk to perspective customers” are you collaborative – “we want to make sure that the entrepreneur is somewhat collaborative and open to suggestions  if the entrepreneur is not open to suggestions or too highly opinionated he could be difficult to influence and chances are he won’t be able to work with anyone else” perspective on faith in silicon valley haque is part of the leadership team of a group called “transforming the bay with christ” or tbc  tbc has drawn together leading pastors business leaders venture capitalists and nonprofit leaders in an effort to serve the social needs in the community such as homelessness druguse and poverty and to help foster the planting of new churches and the relevance of the christian faith in the area although the bay area is one of the most unchurched areas in the country and has one of the lowest rates of philanthropy haque is optimistic i see god working in san francisco in particular  the city’s being transformed economically and there is an interesting growth of churches in the city  there is a tremendous need for people to come to know jesus as their savior and have richer lives than the materialistic consumerdriven life so many have today  i have great hope for what is happening and see much opportunity for the gospel to move in a very interesting way in the bay
