global value research derek dubner but thank you again and good afternoon to all who are joining us today to discuss our first quarter results we are pleased to report another strong quarter and start to  revenue increased  over prior year to  million gross profit margin increased  basis points over prior year to  and adjusted ebitda increased  over prior year to  million i would like to highlight two overarching industry trends that we believe will drive demand for our products and solutions for the foreseeable future first as i have mentioned previously there has been an explosive proliferation of data over the years from developments and technology such as mobile ecommerce and social businesses and governments are inundated with disparate data both structured and unstructured and continue to struggle to glean intelligence in order to maximize efficiency and to increase indiscernible those that do this successfully will thrive those that don’t will not this challenge knows no bounds affecting businesses of all sizes and in all industries cogint’s products and solutions play right into this trend where we seek to serve this massive market by delivering clarity that organizations need for their decision making prophecies utilizing our technology our data assets and our analytical capabilities we are delivering intelligence applications to our customers to enable better and faster decisions the second overarching trend is the powerful movement of offline to digital with respect to consumer consumption of content and purchasing as you know you cannot go about your day without observing the repercussions of this seismic shift just pick up a newspaper or watch tv or go to the mall and you will see the impact of mobile and ecommerce lone standing prominently branded retail stores are shuttering in mass while consumers are enjoying the benefits of priced shopping and purchasing on their mobile devices while sitting in their living room marketers know that they must commit resources to digital marketing and they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future especially devoting resources where they can obtain measurable results our unique ability to develop custom audience data and to activate it against an increasing amount of addressable media is a fundamental driver of our continued success and traction within the digital market technical difficulty drives our business as we roll out new products further enhance existing products and enter new markets we see continued strong demands for our products we know this multiple ways upon that first call by the sales team we are increasingly seeing awareness by the prospect of who we are and our capabilities we are receiving inbound interest from and are establishing key integrations with various industries specific platforms that offer a suite of third party products including those of our more established competitors to their customers by way of example we announce the integration of the fluent acquisition application with the oracle marketing cloud we have built out our sales team traveling and visiting prospects around the country where we are receiving significant interest in the products excellent customer service and cost efficiencies that we can deliver and we are seeing an increase in not only those customers that want to deploy our products more broadly across their organization but also the scale of customer as we move up from smaller early adopters to those customers that demand greater functionality to execute their daily workflow in fact today we now have  customers that spend over  million per year with us there is heightened anticipation with regard to our product roadmap and as a result we continue to see increased interest and uptake in our subscription products our team of data scientists and developers is working aggressively to meet this demand by executing upon a robust product roadmap that will take us well into the future our information services segment revenue increased  over prior year to  million our performance marketing segment revenue increased  over prior year to  million within our information services segment healthcare revenue increased  over prior year to  million financial services revenue increased  over prior year to  million dollars media and entertainment revenue increased  over prior year to  million within our performance marketing segment strategic growth verticals continued to show increasing demand and strong profitability with continued focus on activation of our unique first party database across new channels mobile app revenue increased  over prior year to  million career and education revenue increased  over prior year to  million and market research revenue increased  over prior year to  million now i will turn it over to dan who will discuss the financials dan maclachlan thank you derek and good afternoon the year has start well for us i am pleased with our strong execution in the first quarter while investing across the business enhancing our technology platforms operating infrastructure and fully integrating the queue interactive business onto our marketing services platform we were able to deliver strong revenue growth on expanded profitability our first quarter results again reaffirm the execution of our business model and pave the way for what we expect to be a very successful year for cogint moving onto our first quarter results revenues were  million a  increase over first quarter  driven by strong growth across both our segments adjusted ebitda was  million a  increase over first quarter  adjusted ebitda margin expanded  basis points to  at compare to first quarter of  continuing to the details of our pnl as mentioned revenues were  million for the first quarter our information services revenue increased  to  million led to strong growth from our healthcare financial services and media and entertainment verticals our performance marketing revenue increased  to  million driven by our strategic growth verticals of mobile app career and education and market research cost of revenues were  million compared to  million for the first quarter  a result of increased data and media costs associated with the increase in revenue partially offset by savings attributed to the optimization of our consumer traffic through more efficient media lines gross margin was  for the first quarter  a  basis point increase over first quarter  sga was  million a  increase over first quarter  driven primarily by increased investment in the expansion of our sales operation infrastructure and technology teams partially offset by lower professional fees the  million in sga for the first quarter consisted primarily of  million of non cash share based compensation  million dollars in employee’s salaries and benefits  million in accounting legal and other professional fees and  million in restructuring costs related to the integration of the q interactive business depreciation and amortization was  million in the first quarter  a  increase over first quarter  the increase was primarily the result of the amortization of tangible assets from the acquisition of q interactive in the second quarter of  as a result of the q interactive integration we wrote off a total of  million in long lived assets for certain intangible and fixed assets including trade names and proprietary technology acquired in the q interactive acquisition net loss was  million for the quarter largely a result of non cash share based payments of  million and the onetime non cash write off of long lived assets i just discussed new loss for the quarter  was  million inclusive a tax benefit of  million for the first quarter  we recognize a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and as a result did not book nay tax benefit in the period we expect to be in a full allowance position for the remainder of the year and do not expect to book a tax benefit in  we reported a loss of  cents per share for the first quarter based on a weighted average share count of  million shares moving on to the balance sheet cash and cash equivalent were  million at march   compared to  million at december   total debt including the current portion of long term debt which was used to finance a portion of the fluid acquisition was  million at march   an increase of  million from december   a result of a conditional incremental term loan current assets were  million at march   compared to  million at december   current liabilities exclusive of the current portion of long term debt were  million at march   compared to  million at december   moving on to the statement of cash flows for the quarter ending march   cash provided by operating activities was  million compared to  million for the same period  the  million provided by operating activities was primarily the result of generating current income of  million after adjustments for non cash items totaling  million cash used in investing activities was  million for the quarter ended march   mainly the result of  million used for software developed for internal use cash provided by financing activities was  million for the quarter ended march   a result of  million in net proceeds from the incremental term loan partially offset by the repayment of  million in long term debt for the trailing  months ending march   our leverage ratio was  times net debt to adjusted ebitda as we discussed our indiscernible allocation strategy during our last call and our ability to extract tremendous operating leverage from the execution of our business model we wanted to position the company in a manner so as to seize upon the abundance of opportunities we have on our product road map should we choose to from time to time in that regard we secured a  million term loan from our lending partner in the first quarter of  on substantially the same terms as our existing debt with our expanding margins and continued strong cash flows we expect the leveraging throughout the year continuing to focus on strong organic growth also on our last earnings call or learning’s call i took some time to reflect on and discuss our strategic acquisition of q interactive in  q interactive provided an excellent strategic acquisition opportunity that allowed us to expand out data assets customer base and thought leadership after analyzing the synergies and identifying the capabilities that drive the greatest roi within our marketing business we commenced and completed in the first quarter  the integration of the q interactive business leveraging the best capabilities across the organization and realizing cost technology and resource synergy that will translate into material profitability we expect little or no customer or revenue attrition associated with the integration incurred restructuring cost included in sga in the amount of  million as a result of the integration during the period beginning in the second quarter  we expect to realize approximately  million in annualized saving and sga as a result of the post integration cost synergies  i will now turn it over to derek to conclude our prepared remarks derek dubner thanks dan in closing we are off to a great start to the year we have demonstrated over the last couple of years that we are building a company for the long term with a strong foundation comprised of next generation cloud based platforms a massive data repository containing holistic views of over  of the us consumer population intelligent applications and analytical applications to drive products well into the future we are driven by innovation and our customers we are focused on ai implementation or artificial intelligence layering our platforms with machine learning so as to extract knowledge otherwise unobtainable and combined with the overall themes that we discussed we have tremendous opportunities that lie ahead we are very well positioned for the rest of  and thereafter our operator will now open the line for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jim mcilree with chardan your line is now open jim mcilree derek i think in your remarks you talked about three verticals within both the performance marketing and information services businesses and i’m curious were those three just the largest three verticals in each of those groups or the ones with the greatest growth rate or the ones that you’re focusing on going forward or some or all or some combination of that derek dubner those are the verticals we’re focused on right now as i mentioned on the last call where we’re devoting our resources where we see we can get kind of exponential gain those that we can make the most traction in and that we’re very excited about and that’s why we’ve chosen those verticals to highlight and of course because of the progress in those verticals it’s because of the attention we’re giving them jim mcilree and as far as the size of those verticals relative to anything else they could be random or they’re some of the bigger ones dan maclachlan so when we looked at these verticals we’ve called them out on the performance marketing side over the past few quarters these are those strategic growth verticals where we see the most amount of strategic leverage if you will going into the next few quarters we’ve put a lot of resource into growing these verticals so as it relates to kind of historical growth these are the verticals we see growing over the next few quarters relative to size of some of the other verticals they’re more of the emerging side that are growing quickly the other verticals are relatively stable in regards to kind of historical revenue jim mcilree and dan every time we speak i think i ask you about seasonality so i don’t want to disappoint you this time was q a seasonally weak quarter for information services and performance marketing or both dan maclachlan so i would expect nothing less than to get the seasonality question so we’ve discussed previously that the marketing side of the business performs well on the fourth and first calendar quarters and the risk management side of the business really performs well the first through third calendar quarters looking at the overall business if the marketing business represents a substantial portion of our revenue we do still expect seasonal pressure as the result however we’re layered on multiple strategic growth initiatives into our business model both on the performance and information services side and fully expect to leverage that growth over the next two quarters jim mcilree and the last one at the very end dan you threw in a  million in annual sga savings beginning in q i just want to make sure i’m understanding that correctly so if i look at extra write off  let’s just do a sga and sales and marketing extra the write off so you’re at what  million right now so is it fair to say then a year from now it will be  million less the  million plus whatever growth is required to support the business is my math kind of right dan maclachlan yes that’s the way to look at it as a growth company we’ll continue to invest in the infrastructure sales and technology teams from a headcount perspective but the way to look over the normalized sga is to take out the  million on an annualized basis so looking at where we’re at today at  million in sga you can expect over the next year that  million would be removed from that number offset by some initiatives to grow the business operator our next is from jim goss with barrington research your line is open jim goss following up a little bit on mr mcilree’s first question the information services categories you highlighted don’t really match up with the areas i’d think you’d be going into with idi core so i gather they would relate more to the fluent sort of a spin off is you will is that correct or are some of the financial services areas primarily related to the idi core operations dan maclachlan yes when you look at the product suite and solutions that we have on the risk management side of the business you’re going to see a tremendous amount of those solutions fall into the financial services bucket you’ll also see a good portion of the solutions fall into healthcare when you call out the media and entertainment as it sits today a good portion of the marketing business will fall into that bucket jim goss can you provide any update on the idi core progress to this point i know it was a smaller category but a promising one so where does that stand right now derek dubner we’re doing great in that business but as i’ve mentioned previously and believe me i with could give more transparency than i am it’s just highly competitive and we know our competition feels us we are testing head to head with them with customers and winning tests on our data and we’re growing the business so i can’t give any metrics of on boarded users or customer adoption but as i can tell you that i mentioned in my notes that we’re seeing continued growth in the subscription products meaning the contractual revenue versus transactional and again just to highlight for you and anyone else who is unaware from previous calls that’s a reverse of what we’ve experience in the industry given where we are in the early stages of development we are getting customers that understand where we’re going in this product road map and they’re wanting to lockin in long term subscription contracts in order to lock in price and take advantage of the efficiencies that we’re bringing to them today we are i can say in fact winning larger customers than we were in the smaller early adopters and we’re very excited by that and we continue to make progress as i mentioned in my notes we built out our outside sales team and those are really a bit of a longer sales cycle but they’re knocking on doors of the bigger larger companies again it takes a little time to get that traction as opposed to a small business but we’re very excited about that and we’re not integrating with many of the platforms that are out there by way of example in the collections market there are platforms that offer their customers access to a variety of products and they might be competitive products of course but now when we get that phone call from them saying i’m being told by my customers they want access to you on my platform so let’s bring you onboard that tells us that we’re making traction in the market and so that’s just one of those indicators that we follow and we’re very encouraged jim goss and with the groupings in the performance marketing segment can you talk about which of those aggregate more to the traditional fluent business versus the q interactive business or was there a lot overlap in each of those dan maclachlan so when we look at the q interactive business one of the things we looked at when we talked about kind of strategic acquisitions and we talked a little bit about it last quarter it is from an acquisitions stand point we really looked at the opportunistically inquisitive looking for those assets that ever have misplaced or underappreciated and that can synergistically expand our capabilities and exploit our business model all while having an acquisition cost that is significantly lower than the targets extrinsic value so when we looked at q interactive we knew that we were one of the few potentially only strategic that could extract meaningful value from that asset and as you know q interactive revenue has been declining for several years however we saw tremendous value in the client relationships data and thought leadership because of the already superior platform we had with the indiscernible asset as we integrated the business shared clients and grew the customer base we lost visibility in to the segregation if you will of the indiscernible q business verses the current overall business however what i will say is the growth of our marketing business came off the growth of our fluent platform i would say very little growth in those verticals would be attributed to the legacy q interactive business jim goss okay maybe that lastly are there any other small acquisitions you could make that would either be along the same lines or maybe adjacent to it so that it might extend that traditional business dan maclachlan so jim we’ve made a policy on not to comment on any acquisitions in the likes but i will reiterate my comment that i have made many times we are very intently focused on creating shareholder value and we will always be looking for opportunities if that expands the customer base if that expands our technologies or advances the road map and we are especially interested in assets like you where they might be mispriced or misunderstood where we can make that acquisition that we know it significantly increases shareholder value and is synergistic with the business so i will leave it at that operator our next question is from monish bahl with mhb capital your line is now open monish bahl thank you and congratulations just a couple quick questions with regard to the long term debt of the sequential basis its spiked up  million dollars will you talk about that quickly dan maclachlan sure so again we talked a little bit about it on our last call but what we’ve seen over the last few quarters as we have initiated some of these strategic initiatives is we saw a tremendous amount of opportunity in our products road map and our pipeline and at any given time we want to position ourselves well to basically act upon when necessary on those initiatives to really drive the business as a result of that we reached out to our lending partner and in the first quarter of  brought in an additional net proceeds of  million dollars from an additional term loan on substantially the same terms as our current debt monish bahl okay got it and then back to the health care vertical that showed very robust growth can you talk about what is driving that growth and what sustainable growth rate you could achieve within that vertical thank you dan maclachlan sure and we talk about these growth verticals either where we’re really putting our strategic initiative and see a tremendous amount of ability to leverage not only the data assets that we have on the information services side but also leverage or ability to build custom audience on the marketing side so what that health care vertical really includes is hospitals and medical facilities that look for data validation due diligence on the risk management side we’ll also see on the marketing side vitamin and health supplement marketing companies durable medical equipment buyers pharmacy saving cards and etcetera i can think that market has plenty of room and opportunity for growth we feel that is one of our potential strategic growth verticals we initiated that in the third quarter of this past year and have seen a tremendous amount of capability to grow that vertical and see that to continue throughout  in to  leveraging our ability to build custom audiences that target the need of this particular vertical operator our next question is from sam schaefer with global value research your line is now open sam schaefer derek in the prepared remarks you mentioned the product roadmap over the next several quarters i was hoping you could expand on this and really when we’ll start to see this evolve derek dubner sure sam thanks for the question what i can tell you today is that it is already evolving quite significantly it has been over the last few quarters we have these product enhancements within various solutions that we believe differentiate us from the market place quite significantly and those are indiscernible well in to ‘ where we have defined objectives that we are very excited about that we will cross off one at a time making our products better and better so we have significant initiatives that we will roll out in the next two quarters that we believe will have a very meaningful impact on revenue and so that excites us and then again we have sort of these aspirations i’ll say but you know aspirations makes me sound as if we will not accomplish and we will but their objectives let’s say that are better than what we see in the market and we are very excited about executing upon those later in the year after these first parts of the list are taken out sam schaefer all right you cut out part of the ways through there so i hope i’ll be able to read the answer in the transcripts become available derek dubner sure no i apologize sam i mean in a nutshell i guess i can tell you is that we’ve been executing for the last couple of quarters on that road map well we have been for a long time but we’ve really upped the technology team and our other developers and other locales have been executed upon that plan we have released many of the initiatives they are enhancements within our products that our customers are loving in a nutshell and we will continue to roll out very meaningful initiatives over the next couple of quarters that we believe with have a direct impact on revenue sam schaefer great and i know in the past you were keeping fluent data separated from idi i believe in the last call that you mentioned that really the integration of fluent date into idi core was going to start duly providing update on that integration derek dubner sure i can tell you that fluent data is fully integrated in to idi core and we are very excited about that and our customers are all  sam schaefer i’m hoping to get an update on the multiple trans lawsuits i believe the one was finalized i was curious if we have provided them with the source code or if we’re still in possession of that derek dubner yeah sam you know i

newsletter join pinow sponsor spotlight idi inc august   by kimberly faber technology business tools tweet if you are a pi news roundup subscriber youve probably been introduced to a product called idibasic idibasic is a quality verification and location information product available to investigators in our latest sponsor spotlight derek dubner coceo of idi inc takes our qa and shares details about the company its foundation products and future  who is idi dd idi an acronym for “interactive data intelligence” is an information solutions provider focused on the data fusion industry our founders and management were instrumental in building the leading products in the industry today accurint and tloxp ole poulsen our chief science officer was the primary systems architect of seisint with its product accurint and tlo product tloxp prior to their being acquired by reed elsevier’s lexisnexis and transunion respectively during the past  years i had the pleasure of working with hank asher in his two previous ventures seisint and tlo and i watched his passion for creating great investigative products for the pi industry we at idi have assembled a worldclass team to continue that mission  can you give us a short summary of the current products you have available to private investigators and what they offer dd private investigators may not know that idi through its subsidiary interactive data llc has served as an information solutions provider for over a decade centered primarily in the collections industry we are now devoting time and resources to expand our offerings to serve the investigative markets leveraging our expertise and long history in the verification and location of individuals for debt collection purposes we recently added massive new data sets and released idibasic™ a simple intuitive and costeffective location and verification product this was a very deliberate offering resulting from extensive feedback from several industries including private investigators as you know investigators have many cases that require only verification location or skip tracerelated data legacy providers continue to raise prices on already high fees by packaging skip tracing data with additional unnecessary information at  per hit idibasic is meant to give investigators only what they need for simple skip tracing through an easy to use interface at a price point that makes sense  what products and resources do you see idi offering in the future dd while idibasic serves the simplest of use cases our full investigative system idicore™ is currently in development and set for release in stages throughout the remainder of  with proprietary linking technology and an advanced systems architecture we believe idicore will quickly become the system of choice for private investigators seeking comprehensive views of and the connections between people businesses and assets we are not building just “another system” but truly what we believe to be the nextgeneration investigative platform  from your experience in the data industry where are other products failing in areas that idi is going to excel dd it is our view that many of the difficulties surrounding legacy systems today are related to when they were developed the supporting infrastructure and the business philosophies of organizations previous systems were built as early as  that is a lifetime ago when speaking about technology programming hardware and infrastructure have changed dramatically over the years thus the landscape has changed linking algorithms can become outdated due to the enormous growth in the volume of available data and evolving uses of this data in this changing environment rigid rules or static software will lead to extinction if these legacy systems don’t evolve with these fundamental industry changes there can be actual degradation of the quality of results produced by data fusion systems idi is attacking this problem by using modern data science techniques – a great example of this is machine learning – to develop a system that constantly adapts and gets smarter as time goes on further it’s very difficult to consistently offer costeffective services when a company has invested in and must maintain a vast capitalintensive infrastructure necessary to support the processing of these massive data sets this used to entail investing tens of millions of dollars building a massive data room acquiring thousands of servers and maintaining the personnel to support it once such a capital intensive commitment has been made it is problematic and in some instances impossible to modify the system to take advantage of advancements in today’s technology today’s massive migration by companies of all sizes to cloudbased infrastructures is a perfect example by designing this nextgeneration system from inception idi benefits from the structural changes in data processing and storage that have taken place in recent years resulting in our ability to offer more costeffective services to our customers lastly due to the evolution of this industry current offerings are now run by very large organizations while idi is a publiclytraded company our primary focus will always be the customer our management team and board of directors understand that constant innovation is the key to properly serving the investigative industry we are committed to developing great products at a great price  you touched on key team members having a background in the data space would you walk us through some core team members and their backgrounds as well as how this sets idi apart from the competition dd as i mentioned on the technology side we are extremely pleased to have ole poulsen as our chief science officer ole served as the primary systems architect of both the accurint and tloxp systems and is one of the few individuals in this field to have unique knowledge of how these systems work and more importantly how to design the nextgeneration system for today’s uses additionally ole handpicked a worldclass team of data scientists and engineers from top organizations such as microsoft disney and boeing all based in our seattle office that are knowledgeable experienced and dedicated to creating powerful solutions for the industries we serve on the business side we have several members of the team that have lived and breathed the data fusion and investigative industries for years  how do you see idi continuing to provide value to the private investigation customers in the future dd the investigative market is extremely important to us many of the key features included in today’s investigative systems are a direct result of input from this industry we are dedicated to listening to our customers as well as forging alliances within the industry to better understand trends needs and concerns that can be addressed we are committed to advancing our technology enhancing functionality of our systems and continually increasing the breadth of our data  is there anything you would like to add about your products what’s coming or what’s next for the data world from idi dd the platform we are building today will be crossfunctional so that our powerful systems can drive data analytics across end user databases in other words end users from both the public and private sectors will be able to layer our systems over their massive disparate data sets to glean unattainable insights we will deliver this massive search engine to their door step but i guess this topic is for another day… about derek dubner coceo of idi inc derek

by ezra marbach follow   jul     pm edt tweet comment email print tweetcomment stock quotes in this article idi cocp yhoo efx this column is about a smallcap stock with market capitalization below  million smallcap trading ideas are highly risky but present an opportunity for significant payoff if they work such ideas are sometimes characterized as lottery tickets and are for only the most risktolerant investors as the potential for  loss is high short sellers play an important role in any public equity market that said as a recent new yorker article correctly points out short sellers are often wrong and according to idi idi chairman michael brauser ceo derek dubner and largest shareholder dr phillip frost an article published yesterday by an anonymous blogger about idi is not only wrong but is completely devoid of facts rather than attacking the anonymous blogger management chose to address the articles main points heres our conversation from last night e hi mike idi chairman mike brauser derek dubner ceo of idi is also on the line e great why dont we just address the summary points of the article brauser sure e quoting summary points from anonymous blog post frost mixed up with the wrong crowd as barry honig and michael brauser have spun a tiny struggling debt collections business acquired with m cash into temporarily inflated m shell how do you respond to that brauser i cant judge myself as the wrong crowd and im not exactly sure what that means so thats difficult for me to address e and dr frost has been a partner of yours for a long time brauser dr frost has been a partner of mine for  years weve worked together weve socialized together and weve had multiple successful deals together weve also had deals that have either been his legacy deals or others that weve worked with and have turned them around into successful companies e any examples you can provide brauser yes by way of example dr frost introduced me to biozone which is mentioned in the body of the article biozone had some technology he was interested in we closed on the company and bought it and as we dove further into the company we found that the founder had misrepresented tremendous amounts about the company including a lot of liabilities the ownership of the technology and his position within the company he was eventually removed from the company was quite bitter about that and started to throw out multiple lawsuits throwing out allegations against dr frost and everyone associated with him the long and short of it is we ended up in federal court where he lost his claims he was bought out of his stock at a nominal amount and had no further claims to pursue against the company so from my position he lost because he sued for s of millions of dollars and ended up walking away with something less than a millions dollars e and none of the allegations proved true brauser none of the allegations he went to every investigative body he could trying to stir up as much trouble he then tried to sue everyone associated with it in fact he attempted to blackmail dr frost and myself by having a friend of his whos a writer for a very wellknown magazine threaten to publish a negative article i was able to get him to put that in writing that he would kibosh that article if wed pay him a certain amount of money i showed that to the federal judge in court in sf and really set him back quite a bit and got him into a bit of trouble further to that the company biozone has now become a company called cocrystal cocp it has a large marketcap the stock rose from  to  it trades with good volume and they have significant science and scientists involved with it so there was a story that this author of this article anonymous blog tries to show that we were bad guys and stole the company and did all these horrible things in fact we saved the company and created significant shareholder value so thats just one example ive been working with dr frost for a long time hes obviously a man of very significant character e hes not going to work with just anybody brauser no he wouldnt and im proud to be associated with him from my own view id never do anything that would hurt or harm that relationship because i do cherish it e did you speak to him recently brauser i did i spoke to him today hes very supportive i know that hes a very significant shareholder and i look forward to him participating in the activity of the stock in the short term e so nothing has changed from dr frost brauser no nothing has changed hes fully supportive of the company i can tell you that we have very significant plans together for the companys future i want to emphasize that dr frost and i have significant plans that weve been working on together that will be transformational to the success of this company e and in his mind the allegations are  hes known you for a long time he knows your history youve partnered on deals  brauser sure and i can go one step further in the body of the article the author claims that i was a mere board member of interclick in fact i happen to be one of the founders of interclick  myself and barry honig were founders and i was chairman of the board not just a board member that was one of the first deals i did with dr frost and i brought him into the company where he had a tremendous return on his investment the author of the article seems to be misleading on the stock price and where we ended up selling the company we sold the company at its alltime high there were no shareholders that could have lost any money on this sale and i will say even further to that i was personally responsible and personally handled the transaction with yahoo yhoo and dealt with them with the smallest of details to the closing of the transaction  i was intimately involved in every step of the way i was very proactive as chairman of the board in the success of the company as well as the sale e and what can you say about barry honig brauser barry honig was instrumental as well in the success of the company barry was very supportive was able to raise substantial capital for the company from significant investors helped us execute the vision and build the company when barry and i founded e barry is one of your partners brauser yes in a variety of deals barry honig and i are investors and partners we coinvest in some deals e and dr frost knows him well as well brauser yes he does barry was cochairman of the company for some period of time as well brauser for the record when we founded the company it was doing  a month when we sold it was doing  million e the one you sold to yahoo brauser yes interclick which the author claims i had nothing to do with the next bullet point quoting from the article chairman brausers biography has interesting omissions including bankruptcy wipeout and fraud lawsuits with equifax suing him alleging fraudulent misrepresentations with softbank lawsuit alleging various frauds i think this deserves significant attention i have never had a bankruptcy in my life ive never been part of any bankruptcy ive never taken a company bankrupt so i dont know where he creates these false claims and allegations they are false and cant be substantiated whereby i was a party to any bankruptcy anywhere i dont know what the term wipeout means ive wiped out on a set of skis ive probably wiped out on a bicycle here and there and even on a surfboard but ive never wiped out a company as far as fraud lawsuits it needs to be very clear i did sell a company to equifax efx it was a very successful company after i left the company the management did not do as good as a job as i did and the company declined its revenues and its profits declined equifax did sue me and i did go through a long drawn out litigation with them at the end of the day i ended up winning the lawsuit  they received no compensation from me whatsoever and i was paid by the funds such as softbank  where the author of the blog claims that i misrepresented i was paid a significant settlement i michael brauser was paid by them i didnt pay them anything so if i were guilty of anything it would be very strange for them to pay to settle with me next bullet point quoting from the blog idi stock temporarily inflated from extensive yahoo message board stockpumping scheme touting idi across dozens of boards with interconnected aliases similar to halted and bankrupt fnrg e theres not a lot of discussion that happens on yahoos idi message board brauser i cant help what people talk about but the fact of the matter is they should be very excited about this company because this is the company thats going to have significant impact e and any knowledgeable person knows you dont rely on information thats posted on yahoo finance message boards brauser correct nor do i ever go on them myself so i cant comment on that now this is the most interesting one referring to the bullet point in the article idis transunion lawsuit could mean instant  for stock as idi future apparently based on ip they dont own which transunion acquired when idi cso poulsens last company went bankrupt the author claims if we were to lose the lawsuit  this deserves discussion our ip is not the ip that transunion is using were developing now our own proprietary intellectual property ip and software that will drive our products were building it with our chief scientific officer ole poulsen ole poulsen works for our company and ole poulsen has claimed ownership and in fact developed the ip that transunion is now using for their tlo branch ole poulsen never sold that to tlo never gave them source codes our company idi did buy that technology from ole were not using it what weve done is we alerted transunion that theyre in fact using our ip and that we may be entitled to royalties from their use of our ip transunion then went to the bankruptcy court and asked them to rule on the fact that they owned the ip the bankruptcy court could not make that ruling the bankruptcy court in fact has opened this up for discovery as it seems to me today we believe were the rightful owners of that ip and that transunion is at risk of losing either the rights to use it or the potential to have to pay us royalties but in no way shape or form  if we were to lose our claim that we dont own that ip it would not cause any damage or deter our company from building our products were building today it would not affect the future of our business so this authors claim that it would mean an instant  is absurd its not based on facts and i would highly recommend that if he were to read the court records he would find that were sitting in a very good position and were very comfortable that we have a good shot at winning this case which would only benefit us additionally but would not hurt us e and this is exactly what you told me when i interviewed you a few weeks ago brauser correct that being said the rest of the article is based on false claims our valuation today is based on the fact that we have the team that has created a multibillion dollar industry working for us the software and ip that was created for accurant and reed elsevier that team is working for us the software that is working for transunions tlo division that team is working for us we feel were in a very strong position we feel our company has a tremendous future and were very excited about it todays stock action is a snapshot in a very long movie its just one frame in my opinion its the authors of the article ability to make some money by shorting this stock as he states in the opening of his article and he got away with it e of course theres a place for shorts in the market assuming they have their facts straight brauser in fact im going to plagiarize a line from dr frost shorts will turn out to be our best friends and that could be for more than one reason they may learn not to be short and go long and when they do have to buy back their stock because of our inevitable success it will only increase value to our shareholders thereby they become a very good friend to the company e and none of you guys did any selling today brauser no to be very clear i chairman of the board of idi im an insider im chief principal officer as well and i bought stock today because i find the stock price very compelling here e and dr frost didnt do any selling today brauser no dr frost did not sell any shares i suspect he may be an acquirer but i have not confirmed that e and none of the management sold today brauser i believe other management members including our ceo acquired stock today derek dubner ceo of idi i can confirm that i did acquire stock today brauser so derek dubner the ceo acquired stock today there has been no insider selling that were aware of  certainly not today e and derek nothing happened today or yesterday that would lead to the stock plummeting as it did correct dubner ceo of idi absolutely not there were no company events that led to this today e and youre just as bullish on this company as youve always been dubner absolutely unequivocally e and nothing you learned today about mike brauser concerns you dubner no absolutely not brauser every day that goes by the company gets a little bit better the company is better today than it was yesterday will be better tomorrow e because youre busy building the product brauser exactly every day were once step closer to releasing a product that will change the industry e and derek you support everything that mike just said dubner yes absolutely e derek im assuming you read the article is there anything you feel you need to respond to dubner there isnt much to respond to other than our legacy purchase of interactive data was a very deliberate purchase it was not to buy a debt collection business some small nothing player it was a business that has been around for many years in the risk management industry it has very well established relationships with data suppliers  brauser im going to jump off the call and you can call me back i have dr frost and i need to speak to him e sure dubner ceo of idi as i was saying the legacy purchase of interactive data has long standing relationships with the data suppliers that are very important to being in the risk management industry and of utmost importance it has all the security certifications and infrastructure in place to manage and maintain sensitive consumer information it was a very intentional purchase these claims throughout the article that theres no rd whatsoever is completely fabricated we have had our next generation systems since we formed the company and brought on our cso ole poulsen and our team today continues to build that nextgeneration system and we continue to invest in that so thats false in any event were going to continue doing what were doing building a very big company here and were very excited about the opportunity and everybody involved nothing has changed mike brauser chairman of idi im back on the call i just got off the phone with dr frost whos wildly supportive my suspicion is hell be in the market acquiring shares he actually felt that the article was so off base and such a personal attack that he wanted to speak to counsel about potentially suing them for libel  slander e so he remains supportive bullish and its possible hell buy stock brauser yes e and hes  supportive of you and the company brauser yes e thank you get an email alert each time i write an article for real money click the follow next to my byline to
