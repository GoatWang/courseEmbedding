historyedit baker hughes is the combination of many companies that have developed and introduced technology to serve the petroleum service industry their combined history dates back to the early s during its history baker hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including brown oil tools ctc edeco and elder oil tools completions milchem and newpark drilling fluids exlog mud logging eastman christensen and drilex directional drilling and diamond drill bits teleco measurement while drilling tristate and wilson fishing tools and services aquaness chemlink and petrolite specialty chemicals western atlas seismic exploration well logging bj services company pressure pumping hughes tool companys oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown houston  the hughes tool company was founded in  by business partners walter benona sharp and howard r hughes sr father of howard r hughes jr that year hughes sr and sharp developed the first twocone drill bit designed to enable rotary drilling in harder deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits they conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in goose creek texas each time hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor pulled the bit from a locked wooden box and then his associates ran the bit into the hole the drill pipe twisted off on the first test but the second was extremely successful in  the sharp  hughes bit was granted a us patent in the same year the partners formed the sharphughes tool company in houston texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring  by  ft  mcitation needed after walter sharp died in  hughes purchased sharps half of the business the company was renamed hughes tool company in  and hughes jr inherited it after his fathers death in  through the s and s hughes tool company remained a private enterprise owned by hughes while hughes was engaged in his hollywood and aviation enterprises managers in houston such as fred ayers and maynard montrose kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion in  the engineering and research laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments such as a direct reading spectrometer and xray diffractometer in  hughes introduced selflubricating sealed bearing rock bits after collecting data from thousands of bit runs hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in   saw the introduction of the xline rock bits combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets baker international was formed by reuben c baker who developed a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling in july  rc baker a yearold inventor and entrepreneur in coalinga california was granted a us patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells this innovation launched the business that would become baker oil tools and baker hughes incorporated mr baker had arrived in the california oilfield in  with  cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the los angeles oil boom subsequently he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment in  baker casing shoe company changed its name to baker oil tools inc to reflect its product line of completion cementing and fishing equipment in early  during one of the most successful periods in the companys history reuben c baker retired as president of baker oil tools a few weeks later he died after a brief illness at the age of  and was succeeded by his longtime associate ted sutter although he only had three years of formal education mr baker had been granted  patents in  mr sutter was succeeded by eh hubie clark who would become the first baker hughes chairman of the board in  during its year history before the baker hughes merger baker had only three chief executives inteq also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of baker hughes which consisted of milpark and others this division was called inteq drilling fluids which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids in  these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of baker hughes drilling fluids bhdf with inteq continuing as the drilling and evaluation de company inteq provides directional drilling mwdlwd surface logging mudlogging and coring services the companys flagship brand has been the autotrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the companys relatively strong market share in the past few yearswhen introduced in  with agip spa the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the powerdrive and the geopilot employing the hybrid technique  of pushing and pointing vectoring the bit rather than only pointing the bit or only pushing the bit in  baker international acquired and merged with hughes tool company to form baker hughes incorporated shortly after in  baker hughes acquired christensen diamond products and merged it with hughes tool company to form the drilling and evaluation division hughes christensen after the merger hughes christensen introduced the ar series the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional pdc bits ar series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through lowfriction gauge pads by  hughes christensens gold series pdc line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge reducing the energy required to remove the rock a year later patented chipmaster pdcs known for their efficiency and durability were built on the success of the eggbeater product line hughes christensen next introduced the genesis hcm bits for steerable motors with patented ezsteer depthofcut control technology this same technology was adapted to genesis hcr bits for rotary steerable systems such as the baker hughes autotrak rotary closed loop system genesis zx pdcs followed with new zenith cutters joint venture with schlumbergeredit in  baker hughes and schlumberger formed a joint venture called westerngeco the joint venture was signed for a period of five years and merged bakers western geophysical and schlumbergers gecoprakla the two leading seismic interpretation companies of the time due to diminishing exploration markets new marginal oil fields and low barrel prices the worldwide business of seismic exploration was surviving on just the corporate strength of the two big service companies the only new technology that was being introduced at the time was the dimensional seismic survey monitoring in  baker hughes announced it was selling its  share of the westerngeco joint venture to schlumberger for  billion in cash petroskills allianceedit in  baker hughes joined the petroskills alliance member companies came together to create detailed skill and competency maps which act as a guide for the  short courses taught to industry professionals in over  locations worldwide competency maps are an analysis tool and software

developed and introduced technology to serve the petroleum service industry their combined history dates back to the early s during its history baker hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including brown oil tools ctc edeco and elder oil tools completions milchem and newpark drilling fluids exlog mud logging eastman christensen and drilex directional drilling and diamond drill bits teleco measurement while drilling tristate and wilson fishing tools and services aquaness chemlink and petrolite specialty chemicals western atlas seismic exploration well logging bj services company pressure pumping hughes tool companys oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown houston  the hughes tool company was founded in  by business partners walter benona sharp and howard r hughes sr father of howard r hughes jr that year hughes sr and sharp developed the first twocone drill bit designed to enable rotary drilling in harder deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits they conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in goose creek texas each time hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor pulled the bit from a locked wooden box and then his associates ran the bit into the hole the drill pipe twisted off on the first test but the second was extremely successful in  the sharp  hughes bit was granted a us patent in the same year the partners formed the sharphughes tool company in houston texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring  by  ft  mcitation needed after walter sharp died in  hughes purchased sharps half of the business the company was renamed hughes tool company in  and hughes jr inherited it after his fathers death in  through the s and s hughes tool company remained a private enterprise owned by hughes while hughes was engaged in his hollywood and aviation enterprises managers in houston such as fred ayers and maynard montrose kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion in  the engineering and research laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments such as a direct reading spectrometer and xray diffractometer in  hughes introduced selflubricating sealed bearing rock bits after collecting data from thousands of bit runs hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in   saw the introduction of the xline rock bits combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets baker international was formed by reuben c baker who developed a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling in july  rc baker a yearold inventor and entrepreneur in coalinga california was granted a us patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells this innovation launched the business that would become baker oil tools and baker hughes incorporated mr baker had arrived in the california oilfield in  with  cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the los angeles oil boom subsequently he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment in  baker casing shoe company changed its name to baker oil tools inc to reflect its product line of completion cementing and fishing equipment in early  during one of the most successful periods in the companys history reuben c baker retired as president of baker oil tools a few weeks later he died after a brief illness at the age of  and was succeeded by his longtime associate ted sutter although he only had three years of formal education mr baker had been granted  patents in  mr sutter was succeeded by eh hubie clark who would become the first baker hughes chairman of the board in  during its year history before the baker hughes merger baker had only three chief executives inteq also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of baker hughes which consisted of milpark and others this division was called inteq drilling fluids which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids in  these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of baker hughes drilling fluids bhdf with inteq continuing as the drilling and evaluation de company inteq provides directional drilling mwdlwd surface logging mudlogging and coring services the companys flagship brand has been the autotrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the companys relatively strong market share in the past few yearswhen introduced in  with agip spa the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the powerdrive and the geopilot employing the hybrid technique  of pushing and pointing vectoring the bit rather than only pointing the bit or only pushing the bit in  baker international acquired and merged with hughes tool company to form baker hughes incorporated shortly after in  baker hughes acquired christensen diamond products and merged it with hughes tool company to form the drilling and evaluation division hughes christensen after the merger hughes christensen introduced the ar series the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional pdc bits ar series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through lowfriction gauge pads by  hughes christensens gold series pdc line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge reducing the energy required to remove the rock a year later patented chipmaster pdcs known for their efficiency and durability were built on the success of the eggbeater product line hughes christensen next introduced the genesis hcm bits for steerable motors with patented ezsteer depthofcut control technology this same technology was adapted to genesis hcr bits for rotary steerable systems such as the baker hughes autotrak rotary closed loop system genesis zx pdcs followed with new zenith cutters joint venture with schlumbergeredit in  baker hughes and schlumberger formed a joint venture called westerngeco the joint venture was signed for a period of five years and merged bakers western geophysical and schlumbergers gecoprakla the two leading seismic interpretation companies of the time due to diminishing exploration markets new marginal oil fields and low barrel prices the worldwide business of seismic exploration was surviving on just the corporate strength of the two big service companies the only new technology that was being introduced at the time was the dimensional seismic survey monitoring in  baker hughes announced it was selling its  share of the westerngeco joint venture to schlumberger for  billion in cash petroskills allianceedit in  baker hughes joined the petroskills alliance member companies came together to create detailed skill and competency maps which act as a guide for the

entered talks with halliburton over a merger deal valued at  billion if carried out it would have been the largest merger in the history of the industry halliburton proposed the acquisition of baker hughes which would unite two of the largest us providers of oil field services under the terms of the transaction baker hughes shareholders would have received  shares of halliburton common stock and  in cash for each share of baker hughes stock they own the merger was approved by both companies stockholders and was waiting on approval from several jurisdictions such as the us department of justice on concerns on how it will affect the level of competition prices and consumer welfare for the global oilfield service providing industry undoubtedly the merger would have led to increased consolidation in the oil services market also officials believed that the asset sale would not help the combined company retain competitiveness as smaller buyers would not utilize their larger rivals’ assets efficiently the merger had a deadline of the end of april  after which if a decision had not been made both companies could walk away from the deal if they chose at the beginning of may  the

history dates back to the early s during its history baker hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including brown oil tools ctc edeco and elder oil tools completions milchem and newpark drilling fluids exlog mud logging eastman christensen and drilex directional drilling and diamond drill bits teleco measurement while drilling tristate and wilson fishing tools and services aquaness chemlink and petrolite specialty chemicals western atlas seismic exploration well logging bj services company pressure pumping hughes tool companys oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown houston  the hughes tool company was founded in  by business partners walter benona sharp and howard r hughes sr father of howard r hughes jr that year hughes sr and sharp developed the first twocone drill bit designed to enable rotary drilling in harder deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits they conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in goose creek texas each time hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor pulled the bit from a locked wooden box and then his associates ran the bit into the hole the drill pipe twisted off on the first test but the second was extremely successful in  the sharp  hughes bit was granted a us patent in the same year the partners formed the sharphughes tool company in houston texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring  by  ft  mcitation needed after walter sharp died in  hughes purchased sharps half of the business the company was renamed hughes tool company in  and hughes jr inherited it after his fathers death in  through the s and s hughes tool company remained a private enterprise owned by hughes while hughes was engaged in his hollywood and aviation enterprises managers in houston such as fred ayers and maynard montrose kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion in  the engineering and research laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments such as a direct reading spectrometer and xray diffractometer in  hughes introduced selflubricating sealed bearing rock bits after collecting data from thousands of bit runs hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in   saw the introduction of the xline rock bits combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets baker international was formed by reuben c baker who developed a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling in july  rc baker a yearold inventor and entrepreneur in coalinga california was granted a us patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells this innovation launched the business that would become baker oil tools and baker hughes incorporated mr baker had arrived in the california oilfield in  with  cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the los angeles oil boom subsequently he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment in  baker casing shoe company changed its name to baker oil tools inc to reflect its product line of completion cementing and fishing equipment in early  during one of the most successful periods in the companys history reuben c baker retired as president of baker oil tools a few weeks later he died after a brief illness at the age of  and was succeeded by his longtime associate ted sutter although he only had three years of formal education mr baker had been granted  patents in  mr sutter was succeeded by eh hubie clark who would become the first baker hughes chairman of the board in  during its year history before the baker hughes merger baker had only three chief executives inteq also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of baker hughes which consisted of milpark and others this division was called inteq drilling fluids which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids in  these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of baker hughes drilling fluids bhdf with inteq continuing as the drilling and evaluation de company inteq provides directional drilling mwdlwd surface logging mudlogging and coring services the companys flagship brand has been the autotrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the companys relatively strong market share in the past few yearswhen introduced in  with agip spa the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the powerdrive and the geopilot employing the hybrid technique  of pushing and pointing vectoring the bit rather than only pointing the bit or only pushing the bit in  baker international acquired and merged with hughes tool company to form baker hughes incorporated shortly after in  baker hughes acquired christensen diamond products and merged it with hughes tool company to form the drilling and evaluation division hughes christensen after the merger hughes christensen introduced the ar series the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional pdc bits ar series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through lowfriction gauge pads by  hughes christensens gold series pdc line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge reducing the energy required to remove the rock a year later patented chipmaster pdcs known for their efficiency and durability were built on the success of the eggbeater product line hughes christensen next introduced the genesis hcm bits for steerable motors with patented ezsteer depthofcut control technology this same technology was adapted to genesis hcr bits for rotary steerable systems such as the baker hughes autotrak rotary closed loop system genesis zx pdcs followed with new zenith cutters joint venture with schlumbergeredit in  baker hughes and schlumberger formed a joint venture called westerngeco the joint venture was signed for a period of five years and merged bakers western geophysical and schlumbergers gecoprakla the two leading seismic interpretation companies of the time due to diminishing exploration markets new marginal oil fields and low barrel prices the worldwide business of seismic exploration was surviving on just the corporate strength of the two big service companies the only new technology that was being introduced at the time was the dimensional seismic survey monitoring in  baker hughes announced it was selling its  share of the westerngeco joint venture to schlumberger for  billion in cash petroskills allianceedit in  baker hughes joined the petroskills alliance member companies came together to create detailed skill and competency maps which act as a guide for the  short courses taught to industry professionals in over

historyedit baker hughes is the combination of many companies that have developed and introduced technology to serve the petroleum service industry their combined history dates back to the early s during its history baker hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including brown oil tools ctc edeco and elder oil tools completions milchem and newpark drilling fluids exlog mud logging eastman christensen and drilex directional drilling and diamond drill bits teleco measurement while drilling tristate and wilson fishing tools and services aquaness chemlink and petrolite specialty chemicals western atlas seismic exploration well logging bj services company pressure pumping hughes tool companys oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown houston  the hughes tool company was founded in  by business partners walter benona sharp and howard r hughes sr father of howard r hughes jr that year hughes sr and sharp developed the first twocone drill bit designed to enable rotary drilling in harder deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits they conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in goose creek texas each time hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor pulled the bit from a locked wooden box and then his associates ran the bit into the hole the drill pipe twisted off on the first test but the second was extremely successful in  the sharp  hughes bit was granted a us patent in the same year the partners formed the sharphughes tool company in houston texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring  by  ft  mcitation needed after walter sharp died in  hughes purchased sharps half of the business the company was renamed hughes tool company in  and hughes jr inherited it after his fathers death in  through the s and s hughes tool company remained a private enterprise owned by hughes while hughes was engaged in his hollywood and aviation enterprises managers in houston such as fred ayers and maynard montrose kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion in  the engineering and research laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments such as a direct reading spectrometer and xray diffractometer in  hughes introduced selflubricating sealed bearing rock bits after collecting data from thousands of bit runs hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in   saw the introduction of the xline rock bits combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets baker international was formed by reuben c baker who developed a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling in july  rc baker a yearold inventor and entrepreneur in coalinga california was granted a us patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells this innovation launched the business that would become baker oil tools and baker hughes incorporated mr baker had arrived in the california oilfield in  with  cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the los angeles oil boom subsequently he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment in  baker casing shoe company changed its name to baker oil tools inc to reflect its product line of completion cementing and fishing equipment in early  during one of the most successful periods in the companys history reuben c baker retired as president of baker oil tools a few weeks later he died after a brief illness at the age of  and was succeeded by his longtime associate ted sutter although he only had three years of formal education mr baker had been granted  patents in  mr sutter was succeeded by eh hubie clark who would become the first baker hughes chairman of the board in  during its year history before the baker hughes merger baker had only three chief executives inteq also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of baker hughes which consisted of milpark and others this division was called inteq drilling fluids which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids in  these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of baker hughes drilling fluids bhdf with inteq continuing as the drilling and evaluation de company inteq provides directional drilling mwdlwd surface logging mudlogging and coring services the companys flagship brand has been the autotrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the companys relatively strong market share in the past few yearswhen introduced in  with agip spa the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the powerdrive and the geopilot employing the hybrid technique  of pushing and pointing vectoring the bit rather than only pointing the bit or only pushing the bit in  baker international acquired and merged with hughes tool company to form baker hughes incorporated shortly after in  baker hughes acquired christensen diamond products and merged it with hughes tool company to form the drilling and evaluation division hughes christensen after the merger hughes christensen introduced the ar series the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional pdc bits ar series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through lowfriction gauge pads by  hughes christensens gold series pdc line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge reducing the energy required to remove the rock a year later patented chipmaster pdcs known for their efficiency and durability were built on the success of the eggbeater product line hughes christensen next introduced the genesis hcm bits for steerable motors with patented ezsteer depthofcut control technology this same technology was adapted to genesis hcr bits for rotary steerable systems such as the baker hughes autotrak rotary closed loop system genesis zx pdcs followed with new zenith cutters joint venture with schlumbergeredit in  baker hughes and schlumberger formed a joint venture called westerngeco the joint venture was signed for a period of five years and merged bakers western geophysical and schlumbergers gecoprakla the two leading seismic interpretation companies of the time due to diminishing exploration markets new marginal oil fields and low barrel prices the worldwide business of seismic exploration was surviving on just the corporate strength of the two big service companies the only new technology that was being introduced at the time was the dimensional seismic survey monitoring in  baker hughes announced it was selling its  share of the westerngeco joint venture to schlumberger for  billion in cash petroskills allianceedit in  baker hughes joined the petroskills alliance member companies came together to create detailed skill and competency maps which act as a guide for the  short courses taught to industry professionals in over  locations worldwide competency maps are an analysis tool and software

shareholders would have received  shares of halliburton common stock and  in cash for each share of baker hughes stock they own the merger was approved by both companies stockholders and was waiting on approval from several jurisdictions such as the us department of justice on concerns on how it will affect the level of competition prices and consumer welfare for the global oilfield service providing industry undoubtedly the merger would have led to increased consolidation in the oil services market also officials believed that the asset sale would not help the combined company retain competitiveness as smaller buyers would not utilize their larger rivals’ assets efficiently the merger had a deadline of the end of april  after which if a decision had not been made both companies

christensen and drilex directional drilling and diamond drill bits teleco measurement while drilling tristate and wilson fishing tools and services aquaness chemlink and petrolite specialty chemicals western atlas seismic exploration well logging bj services company pressure pumping hughes tool companys oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown houston  the hughes tool company was founded in  by business partners walter benona sharp and howard r hughes sr father of howard r hughes jr that year hughes sr and sharp developed the first twocone drill bit designed to enable rotary drilling in harder deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits they conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in goose creek texas each time hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor pulled the bit from a locked wooden box and then his associates ran the bit into the hole the drill pipe twisted off on the first test but the second was extremely successful in  the sharp  hughes bit was granted a us patent in the same year the partners formed the sharphughes tool company in houston texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring  by  ft  mcitation needed after walter sharp died in  hughes purchased sharps half of the business the company was renamed hughes tool company in  and hughes jr inherited it after his fathers death in  through the s and s hughes tool company remained a private enterprise owned by hughes while hughes was engaged in his hollywood and aviation enterprises managers in houston such as fred ayers and maynard montrose kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion in  the engineering and research laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments such as a direct reading spectrometer and xray diffractometer in  hughes introduced selflubricating sealed bearing rock bits after collecting data from thousands of bit runs hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in   saw the introduction of the xline rock bits combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets baker international was formed by reuben c baker who developed a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling in july  rc baker a yearold inventor and entrepreneur in coalinga california was granted a us patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells this innovation launched the business that would become baker oil tools and baker hughes incorporated mr baker had arrived in the california oilfield in  with  cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the los angeles oil boom subsequently he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment in  baker casing shoe company changed its name to baker oil tools inc to reflect its product line of completion cementing and fishing equipment in early  during one of the most successful periods in the companys history reuben c baker retired as president of baker oil tools a few weeks later he died after a brief illness at the age of  and was succeeded by his longtime associate ted sutter although he only had three years of formal education mr baker had been granted  patents in  mr sutter was succeeded by eh hubie clark who would become the first baker hughes chairman of the board in  during its year history before the baker hughes merger baker had only three chief executives inteq also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of baker hughes which consisted of milpark and others this division was called inteq drilling fluids which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids in  these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of baker hughes drilling fluids bhdf with inteq continuing as the drilling and evaluation de company inteq provides directional drilling mwdlwd surface logging mudlogging and coring services the companys flagship brand has been the autotrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the companys relatively strong market share in the past few yearswhen introduced in  with agip spa the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the powerdrive and the geopilot employing the hybrid technique  of pushing and pointing vectoring the bit rather than only pointing the bit or only pushing the bit in  baker international acquired and merged with hughes tool company to form baker hughes incorporated shortly after in  baker hughes acquired christensen diamond products and merged it with hughes tool company to form the drilling and evaluation division hughes christensen after the merger hughes christensen introduced the ar series the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional pdc bits ar series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through lowfriction gauge pads by  hughes christensens gold series pdc line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge reducing the energy required to remove the rock a year later patented chipmaster pdcs known for their efficiency and durability were built on the success of the eggbeater product line hughes christensen next introduced the genesis hcm bits for steerable motors with patented ezsteer depthofcut control technology this same technology was adapted to genesis hcr bits for rotary steerable systems such as the baker hughes autotrak rotary closed loop system genesis zx pdcs followed with new zenith cutters joint venture with schlumbergeredit in  baker hughes and schlumberger formed a joint venture called westerngeco the joint venture was signed for a period of five years and merged bakers western geophysical and schlumbergers gecoprakla the two leading

is the combination of many companies that have developed and introduced technology to serve the petroleum service industry their combined history dates back to the early s during its history baker hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including brown oil tools ctc edeco and elder oil tools completions milchem and newpark drilling fluids exlog mud logging eastman christensen and drilex directional drilling and diamond drill bits teleco measurement while drilling tristate and wilson fishing tools and services aquaness chemlink and petrolite specialty chemicals western atlas seismic exploration well logging bj services company pressure pumping hughes tool companys oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown houston  the hughes tool company was founded in  by business partners walter benona sharp and howard r hughes sr father of howard r hughes jr that year hughes sr and sharp developed the first twocone drill bit designed to enable rotary drilling in harder deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits they conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in goose creek texas each time hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor pulled the bit from a locked wooden box and then his associates ran the bit into the hole the drill pipe twisted off on the first test but the second was extremely successful in  the sharp  hughes bit was granted a us patent in the same year the partners formed the sharphughes tool company in houston texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring  by  ft  mcitation needed after walter sharp died in  hughes purchased sharps half of the business the company was renamed hughes tool company in  and hughes jr inherited it after his fathers death in  through the s and s hughes tool company remained a private enterprise owned by hughes while hughes was engaged in his hollywood and aviation enterprises managers in houston such as fred ayers and maynard montrose kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion in  the engineering and research laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments such as a direct reading spectrometer and xray diffractometer in  hughes introduced selflubricating sealed bearing rock bits after collecting data from thousands of bit runs hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in   saw the introduction of the xline rock bits combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets baker international was formed by reuben c baker who developed a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling in july  rc baker a yearold inventor and entrepreneur in coalinga california was granted a us patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells this innovation launched the business that would become baker oil tools and baker hughes incorporated mr baker had arrived in the california oilfield in  with  cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the los angeles oil boom subsequently he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment in  baker casing shoe company changed its name to baker oil tools inc to reflect its product line of completion cementing and fishing equipment in early  during one of the most successful periods in the companys history reuben c baker retired as president of baker oil tools a few weeks later he died after a brief illness at the age of  and was succeeded by his longtime associate ted sutter although he only had three years of formal education mr baker had been granted  patents in  mr sutter was succeeded by eh hubie clark who would become the first baker hughes chairman of the board in  during its year history before the baker hughes merger baker had only three chief executives inteq also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of baker hughes which consisted of milpark and others this division was called inteq drilling fluids which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids in  these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of baker hughes drilling fluids bhdf with inteq continuing as the drilling and evaluation de company inteq provides directional drilling mwdlwd surface logging mudlogging and coring services the companys flagship brand has been the autotrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the companys relatively strong market share in the past few yearswhen introduced in  with agip spa the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the powerdrive and the geopilot employing the hybrid technique  of pushing and pointing vectoring the bit rather than only pointing the bit or only pushing the bit in  baker international acquired and merged with hughes tool company to form baker hughes incorporated shortly after in  baker hughes acquired christensen diamond products and merged it with hughes tool company to form the drilling and evaluation division hughes christensen after the merger hughes christensen introduced the ar series the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional pdc bits ar series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through lowfriction gauge pads by  hughes christensens gold series pdc line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge reducing the energy required to remove the rock a year later patented chipmaster pdcs known for their efficiency and durability were built on the success of the eggbeater product line hughes christensen next introduced the genesis hcm bits for steerable motors with patented ezsteer depthofcut control technology this same technology was adapted to genesis hcr bits for rotary steerable systems such as the baker hughes autotrak rotary closed loop system genesis zx pdcs followed with new zenith cutters joint venture with schlumbergeredit in  baker hughes and schlumberger formed a joint venture called westerngeco the joint venture was signed for a period of five years and merged bakers western geophysical and schlumbergers gecoprakla the two leading seismic interpretation companies of the time due to diminishing exploration markets new marginal oil fields and low barrel prices the worldwide business of seismic exploration was surviving on just the corporate strength of the two big service companies the only new technology that was being introduced at the time was the dimensional seismic survey monitoring in  baker hughes announced it was selling its  share of the westerngeco joint venture to schlumberger for  billion in cash petroskills allianceedit in  baker hughes joined the petroskills alliance member companies came together to create detailed skill and competency maps which act as a guide for the  short courses taught to industry professionals in over  locations worldwide competency maps are an analysis tool and software

shareholders would have received  shares of halliburton common stock and  in cash for each share of baker hughes stock they own the merger was approved by both companies stockholders and was waiting on approval from several jurisdictions such as the us department of justice on concerns on how it will affect the level of competition prices and consumer welfare for the global oilfield service providing industry undoubtedly the merger would have led to increased consolidation in the oil services market also officials believed that the asset sale would not help the combined company retain competitiveness as smaller buyers would not utilize their larger rivals’ assets efficiently the merger had a deadline of the end of april  after which if a decision had not been made both companies could walk away from the deal if they chose at the beginning of may  the day after the deadline expired baker hughes and halliburton announced the termination of the merger agreement acquisition by

history dates back to the early s during its history baker hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including brown oil tools ctc edeco and elder oil tools completions milchem and newpark drilling fluids exlog mud logging eastman christensen and drilex directional drilling and diamond drill bits teleco measurement while drilling tristate and wilson fishing tools and services aquaness chemlink and petrolite specialty chemicals western atlas seismic exploration well logging bj services company pressure pumping hughes tool companys oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown houston  the hughes tool company was founded in  by business partners walter benona sharp and howard r hughes sr father of howard r hughes jr that year hughes sr and sharp developed the first twocone drill bit designed to enable rotary drilling in harder deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits they conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in goose creek texas each time hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor pulled the bit from a locked wooden box and then his associates ran the bit into the hole the drill pipe twisted off on the first test but the second was extremely successful in  the sharp  hughes bit was granted a us patent in the same year the partners formed the sharphughes tool company in houston texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring  by  ft  mcitation needed after walter sharp died in  hughes purchased sharps half of the business the company was renamed hughes tool company in  and hughes jr inherited it after his fathers death in  through the s and s hughes tool company remained a private enterprise owned by hughes while hughes was engaged in his hollywood and aviation enterprises managers in houston such as fred ayers and maynard montrose kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion in  the engineering and research laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments such as a direct reading spectrometer and xray diffractometer in  hughes introduced selflubricating sealed bearing rock bits after collecting data from thousands of bit runs hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in   saw the introduction of the xline rock bits combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets baker international was formed by reuben c baker who developed a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling in july  rc baker a yearold inventor and entrepreneur in coalinga california was granted a us patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells this innovation launched the business that would become baker oil tools and baker hughes incorporated mr baker had arrived in the california oilfield in  with  cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the los angeles oil boom subsequently he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment in  baker casing shoe company changed its name to baker oil tools inc to reflect its product line of completion cementing and fishing equipment in early  during one of the most successful periods in the companys history reuben c baker retired as president of baker oil tools a few weeks later he died after a brief illness at the age of  and was succeeded by his longtime associate ted sutter although he only had three years of formal education mr baker had been granted  patents in  mr sutter was succeeded by eh hubie clark who would become the first baker hughes chairman of the board in  during its year history before the baker hughes merger baker had only three chief executives inteq also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of baker hughes which consisted of milpark and others this division was called inteq drilling fluids which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids in  these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of baker hughes drilling fluids bhdf with inteq continuing as the drilling and evaluation de company inteq provides directional drilling mwdlwd surface logging mudlogging and coring services the companys flagship brand has been the autotrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the companys relatively strong market share in the past few yearswhen introduced in  with agip spa the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the powerdrive and the geopilot employing the hybrid technique  of pushing and pointing vectoring the bit rather than only pointing the bit or only pushing the bit in  baker international acquired and merged with hughes tool company to form baker hughes incorporated shortly after in  baker hughes acquired christensen diamond products and merged it with hughes tool company to form the drilling and evaluation division hughes christensen after the merger hughes christensen introduced the ar series the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional pdc bits ar series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through lowfriction gauge pads by  hughes christensens gold series pdc line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge reducing the energy required to remove the rock a year later patented chipmaster pdcs known for their efficiency and durability were built on the success of the eggbeater product line hughes christensen next introduced the genesis hcm bits for steerable motors with patented ezsteer depthofcut control technology this same technology was adapted to genesis hcr bits for rotary steerable systems such as the baker hughes autotrak rotary closed loop system genesis zx pdcs followed with new zenith cutters joint venture with schlumbergeredit in  baker hughes and schlumberger formed a joint venture called westerngeco the joint venture was signed for a period of five years and merged bakers western geophysical and schlumbergers gecoprakla the two leading seismic interpretation companies of the time due to diminishing exploration markets new marginal oil fields and low barrel prices the worldwide business of seismic exploration was surviving on just the corporate strength of the two big service companies the only new technology that was being introduced at the time was the dimensional seismic survey monitoring in  baker hughes announced it was selling its  share of the westerngeco joint venture to schlumberger for  billion in cash petroskills allianceedit in  baker hughes joined the petroskills alliance member companies came together to create detailed skill and competency maps which act as a guide for the  short courses taught to industry professionals in over

looking for firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
