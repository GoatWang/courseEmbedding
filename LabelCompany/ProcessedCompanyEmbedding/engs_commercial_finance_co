the owner operator’s dilemma june   engs commercial financeblogleave a comment when you first considered becoming a trucker the image that came to mind was a big tractor trailer on the open road right  well a growing percentage of trucking is moving into what is categorized as “short haul” trucking meaning under  mile delivery radius over the last few decades larger carriers are introducing more depots throughout major routes giving them greater capacity and increasing the number of short haul loads between depots  with this shift in infrastructure opportunities abound for owner operators to cash in on a local route allowing them to carry more loads in a week and making tractor maintenance and repairs a more consistent—and convenience—part of their calendar key advantages of short haul trucking reduced foodtravel expenses there is a propensity to eat out more on the road which can impact one’s health as well as the bottom line  it takes discipline but eating at home and bringing snacks from your local grocery store instead of a truck stop is certain to help you save money more loads per week with the benefit of shorter runs and more than likely an exemption from the hours of service rule it’s possible to pick up more loads in a day for the short hops consistent familiar service area especially true when working with a single large carrier you’ll likely inherit dedicated routes so when detours or unscheduled backups accidents emergency maintenance occur you will likely be able to reroute on your own terms better worklife balance the trucking life is notorious for straining family relationships  with long hours and unpredictable schedules long haul trucking can be challenging for loved ones versatile tractor options with short haul trucking you are free to use more affordable trucks since a sleeper cab is not typically required  the shorter trips also helps justify the purchase of a used big rig instead of new since mileage likely won’t add up as quickly if you’re enjoying your career as a trucker however long for something that gets you back to your family regularly short haul trucking just might be the right fit for you  if you’re investigating the opportunity be sure to take advantage of some of the benefits of short haul trucking such as reduced trucking insurance premiums and planned fueling stops which can improve your bottom line leave a

an established owner operator or manage a small fleet and you’re looking to purchase a new truck you have a few options for financing a truck however just starting out purchasing your first truck can be difficult due to lack of established business credit lets begin with financing a truck for established businesses funding new or gentlyused semi truck purchases generally fall into  categories cash purchase loan lease buy a big rig with cash whether you’re business is thriving or it’s a capital investment from your personal account or friends  family throwing allcash at a depreciating asset may feel good to have it paid off however if it leaves you cashpoor you’re missing opportunities to grow your business in other ways instead tying your capital up to maintain the current business size  even if you have a healthy bank account maintaining that fund for a rainy day or for various growth strategies is an excellent option while also putting a larger down payment down on your next rig finance with a semi truck loan rates are pretty favorable right now so borrowing can be cheap and give you the cash flow flexibility you need to see a positive return on your investment  the challenges with a loan include borrower credit corporate credit vehicle age and mileage and intended purpose  many generalist lenders who aren’t familiar with the industry will have arbitrary rules in place for funding purchases of transportation equipment used for particular purposes  by choosing a truck and trailer finance specialist you’re working with a team who understands your needs cash flow potential and can make a better assessment and recommendations for your loan lease your new truck and trailer similar to loans leases rely on credit ratings and the current prime rate however generally have a lower monthly bill and have a buyout option at the end  the flexibility of new equipment at lower payments helps considerably during leaner times or when working capital is tied up in another venture owner operator lease purchase programs lease purchase programs are a helpful tool for both new owner operators as well as recruitment tools for larger fleets to bring new drivers to drive under their brand  a simple way of thinking of it is a new operator subleasing a truck from their leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked

caught the headline and were intrigued either searching for business growth strategies or are a regular reader of our posts  one item to note there is no “silver bullet” approach to business growth except through smart decisions hard work and a little luck  what we’ve pulled together is a handful of tips to enhance the “smart decisions” area of your business’ growth track  know thy customer whether you’re just starting out or an established and growing business understanding who your customer is or should be through thorough market research and segmenting your primary market into groups of customers for targeted marketing campaigns  prospective customers may be segmented by demographical and geographical data points or if you’re spanning industries segment by industry type  seek funding for business growth in a season of growth managing cash flow while you expand may be difficult and “bootstrapping” the business may either make operations tight or hamper growth through available capital  look at the growing expenses for your business—is it general increase in overhead or new capital investments in equipment  if the latter work with an equipment finance company who specializes in your industry  consider them the experts in providing funding through equipment leases and loans designed to help your business grow taking into account market volume and any seasonal influences  discover ancillary products  services to sell while it’s important to keep focus on your target market include in your growth plan the research and discovery of additional products and services that you can provide as an addon sale to existing customers creating additional revenue with minimal investment and may provide a little more insulation from economic fluctuation bonus

your operations  for a trucking business this may mean working with multiple service yards or changing fuel card programs  regardless of your product or service offering growth will create new vendor

factoring to support backoffice needs of our customers one thought on “ tips for growing businesses” i like what this article mentions about business growth and how it generally involves a lot of financial changes it makes sense that a small business that experiences a lot of growth will also have a lot of financial changes that could get a lot more complicated having a professional financial

financeblogleave a comment for years you’ve been dreaming of hitting the open road being your own boss and making a solid living and now you’re ready  cdl in hand vision of launching your own trucking company but you need to get your feet wet with a larger carrier to learn the ropes and get some revenue  while you are picking a company to work for the culture extends beyond the typical to get the inside scoop learning about the culture and inner workings of a company can be easier when looking at large companies though depending on the size of your trucking driving school and past networking opportunities it’s likely you’ll have a first or seconddegree connection to a driver inside the company who should be able to give you a degree of insight into what to expect from this firm do your homework review the company’s reputation not just from what employees you know are saying but do they have a good track record retaining drivers  do they offer and support opportunities for employees to become contracted owneroperators  are they equipped with any truck lease or loan programs to help drivers launch their businesses other helpful information to research includes getting a read on the company’s age and financial health  do they have longstanding relationships and nocontest contracts with load managers and freight customers or is every load bid out through a broker or load board location depending on your future plans you’ll want to be sure to choose a carrier who maintains healthy operations near your preferred service area whether it’s your home base for overtheroad trucking or local or regional freight  if you are planning to incorporate as an owneroperator in the future looking at the incorporation fees schedule and tax implications depending on state will be an important consideration tractor equipment offered as an employee or even contracted driver you will be provided a tractor to drive look into the track record of that equipment in case you are required to bear the cost of any of the maintenance or should there be reliability concerns that will impact your uptime and takehome pay compare with others it’s helpful to build a matrix of several trucking companies to help you better examine the pros and cons of each  it’s difficult to find negatives when only examining a single firm  by pulling in a few competitors in your evaluation you may be surprised by the company offering the greatest career opportunity if your decision is still unclear after personal research consider reaching out to a trucking industry recruiter  they are paid by the hiring trucking company so there is virtually no risk for the driver on the hunt leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email

probably familiar with the process you walk into your local car dealership peruse the lot and are pounced on by an eager salesperson  after a bit of chitchat you take the car out for a test drive pop the hood and you might even do some quick research online on your phone to see if you’re getting a deal or the right packages with the car  a bit of haggling later you shake hands and start signing papers  if you’re financing the car you can use the inhouse lender or go back to your bank and get a loan for the balance less deposit andor tradein  easy right semi truck purchases are quite different from buying a sedan from your local dealer most definitely when it comes to financing the purchase  big rig financing falls somewhere between a business loan and vehicle loan and most banks don’t deal with truck loans or aren’t equipped to appropriately determine terms and payments  many semi truck dealers have preferred vendors inhouse who can provide funding however you want to be sure you’re signing up with a financing company and payment terms that work for your business choose a truck financing specialist it’s true not every big bank in town will fund semi truck purchases however there are a number of commercial finance companies who specialize in funding truck loans and leases  a trucking industry loan specialist understands more about your industry than simply a credit score

the owner operator’s dilemma june   engs commercial financeblogleave a comment when you first considered becoming a trucker the image that came to mind was a big tractor trailer on the open road right  well a growing percentage of trucking is moving into what is categorized as “short haul” trucking meaning under  mile delivery radius over the last few decades larger carriers are introducing more depots throughout major routes giving them greater capacity and increasing the number of short haul loads between depots  with this shift in infrastructure opportunities abound for owner operators to cash in on a local route allowing them to carry more loads in a week and making tractor maintenance and repairs a more consistent—and convenience—part of their calendar key advantages of short haul trucking reduced foodtravel expenses there is a propensity to eat out more on the road which can impact one’s health as well as the bottom line  it takes discipline but eating at home and bringing snacks from your local grocery store instead of a truck stop is certain to help you save money more loads per week with the benefit of shorter runs and more than likely an exemption from the hours of service rule it’s possible to pick up more loads in a day for the short hops consistent familiar service area especially true when working with a single large carrier you’ll likely inherit dedicated routes so when detours or unscheduled backups accidents emergency maintenance occur you will likely be able to reroute on your own terms better worklife balance the trucking life is notorious for straining family relationships  with long hours and unpredictable schedules long haul trucking can be challenging for loved ones versatile tractor options with short haul trucking you are free to use more affordable trucks since a sleeper cab is not typically required  the shorter trips also helps justify the purchase of a used big rig instead of new since mileage likely won’t add up as quickly if you’re enjoying your career as a trucker however long for something that gets you back to your family regularly short haul trucking just might be the right fit for you  if you’re investigating the opportunity be sure to take advantage of some of the benefits of short haul trucking such as reduced trucking insurance premiums and planned fueling stops which can improve your bottom line leave a

news help contact us customer service center dealer login  tips for growing businessesengs commercial finance  blog   tips for growing businesses may   engs commercial financeblog comment you no doubt caught the headline and were intrigued either searching for business growth strategies or are a regular reader of our posts  one item to note there is no “silver bullet” approach to business growth except through smart decisions hard work and a little luck  what we’ve pulled together is a handful of tips to enhance the “smart decisions” area of your business’ growth track  know thy customer whether you’re just starting out or an established and growing business understanding who your customer is or should be through thorough market research and segmenting your primary market into groups of customers for targeted marketing campaigns  prospective customers may be segmented by demographical and geographical data points or if you’re spanning industries segment by industry type  seek funding for business growth in a season of growth managing cash flow while you expand may be difficult and “bootstrapping” the business may either make operations tight or hamper growth through available capital  look at the growing expenses for your business—is it general increase in overhead or new capital investments in equipment  if the latter work with an equipment finance company who specializes in your industry  consider them the experts in providing funding through equipment leases and loans designed to help your business grow taking into account market volume and any seasonal influences  discover ancillary products  services to sell while it’s important to keep focus on your target market include in your growth plan the research and discovery of additional products and services that you can provide as an addon sale to existing customers creating additional revenue with minimal investment and may provide a little more insulation from economic fluctuation bonus identify and engage new vendors offering services to a larger market or territory requires additional funding but also will often require working with bigger or a larger number of vendors to support your operations  for a trucking business this may mean working with multiple service yards or changing fuel card programs  regardless of your product or service offering growth will create new vendor opportunities be it volume discounts or a switch entirely  have this understanding going in keeps you proactive rather than reactive to the realities of supply and demand we’ve funded equipment loans and leases for more than  years serving transportation industrial and construction industries with unique financing solutions driving business on the frontend and now offering insurance and invoice factoring to support backoffice needs of our customers one thought on “ tips for growing businesses” i like what this article mentions about business growth and how it generally involves a lot of financial changes it makes sense that a small business that experiences a lot of growth will also have a lot of financial changes that could get a lot more complicated having a professional financial consultant or manager could be very beneficial to ensure there aren’t mistakes made that could set the company back significantly reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be

different from buying a sedan from your local dealer most definitely when it comes to financing the purchase  big rig financing falls somewhere between a business loan and vehicle loan and most banks don’t deal with truck loans or aren’t equipped to appropriately determine terms and payments  many semi truck dealers have preferred vendors inhouse who can provide funding however you want to be sure you’re signing up with a financing company and payment terms that work for your business choose a truck financing specialist it’s true not every big bank in town will fund semi truck purchases however there are a number of commercial finance companies who specialize in funding truck loans and leases  a trucking industry loan specialist understands more about your industry than simply a credit score and asset depreciation which are certainly important but also is familiar with the type of equipment you’re purchases load types certain restrictions and seasonal and economic influences that will impact your ability to pay  you’re not simply choosing a truck finance company—you’re choosing a strategic financing partner for your business understand your creditworthiness just like any other loan a truck financier will look at the purchaser’s credit history and score which will influence borrowing limit rate and terms on a repayment schedule  if you walk into the lending office or phone call with this information you’ll be prepared to have a more direct conversation with your potential lender often leading to either better rates more tailored payment schedule or possibly both  at the end of the day you’re looking to be behind the wheel hauling loads and earning money  picking a strategic lending partner up front can put you in the cab faster and keep you there for the road ahead one thought on “financing your first big rig” i really like that you touch on how important it is to understand how a lender will view you it makes sense that your credit score history etc will all have an effect on how a lender views you as loan worthy this could be particularly helpful to understand for such a large loan like for a big rig because it can be a very delicate situation reply leave a

financeblogleave a comment for years you’ve been dreaming of hitting the open road being your own boss and making a solid living and now you’re ready  cdl in hand vision of launching your own trucking company but you need to get your feet wet with a larger carrier to learn the ropes and get some revenue  while you are picking a company to work for the culture extends beyond the typical to get the inside scoop learning about the culture and inner workings of a company can be easier when looking at large companies though depending on the size of your trucking driving school and past networking opportunities it’s likely you’ll have a first or seconddegree connection to a driver inside the company who should be able to give you a degree of insight into what to expect from this firm do your homework review the company’s reputation not just from what employees you know are saying but do they have a good track record retaining drivers  do they offer and support opportunities for employees to become contracted owneroperators  are they equipped with any truck lease or loan programs to help drivers launch their businesses other helpful information to research includes getting a read on the company’s age and financial health  do they have longstanding relationships and nocontest contracts with load managers and freight customers or is every load bid out through a broker or load board location depending on your future plans you’ll want to be sure to choose a carrier who maintains healthy operations near your preferred service area whether it’s your home base for overtheroad trucking or local or regional freight  if you are planning to incorporate as an owneroperator in the future looking at the incorporation fees schedule and tax implications depending on state will be an important consideration tractor equipment offered as an employee or even contracted driver you will be provided a tractor to drive look into the track record of that equipment in case you are required to bear the cost of any of the maintenance or should there be reliability concerns that will impact your uptime and takehome pay compare with others it’s helpful to build a matrix of several trucking companies to help you better examine the pros and cons of each  it’s difficult to find negatives when only examining a single firm  by pulling in a few competitors in your evaluation you may be surprised by the company offering the greatest career opportunity if your decision is still unclear after personal research consider reaching out to a trucking industry recruiter  they are paid by the hiring trucking company so there is virtually no risk for the driver on the hunt leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email

an established owner operator or manage a small fleet and you’re looking to purchase a new truck you have a few options for financing a truck however just starting out purchasing your first truck can be difficult due to lack of established business credit lets begin with financing a truck for established businesses funding new or gentlyused semi truck purchases generally fall into  categories cash purchase loan lease buy a big rig with cash whether you’re business is thriving or it’s a capital investment from your personal account or friends  family throwing allcash at a depreciating asset may feel good to have it paid off however if it leaves you cashpoor you’re missing opportunities to grow your business in other ways instead tying your capital up to maintain the current business size  even if you have a healthy bank account maintaining that fund for a rainy day or for various growth strategies is an excellent option while also putting a larger down payment down on your next rig finance with a semi truck loan rates are pretty favorable right now so borrowing can be cheap and give you the cash flow flexibility you need to see a positive return on your investment  the challenges with a loan include borrower credit corporate credit vehicle age and mileage and intended purpose  many generalist lenders who aren’t familiar with the industry will have arbitrary rules in place for funding purchases of transportation equipment used for particular purposes  by choosing a truck and trailer finance specialist you’re working with a team who understands your needs cash flow potential and can make a better assessment and recommendations for your loan lease your new truck and trailer similar to loans leases rely on credit ratings and the current prime rate however generally have a lower monthly bill and have a buyout option at the end  the flexibility of new equipment at lower payments helps considerably during leaner times or when working capital is tied up in another venture owner operator lease purchase programs lease purchase programs are a helpful tool for both new owner operators as well as recruitment tools for larger fleets to bring new drivers to drive under their brand  a simple way of thinking of it is a new operator subleasing a truck from their leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked

comment a commute to work can be stressful—more so if your commute is your job  dealing with stopandgo traffic unpredictable weather irresponsible and dangerous drivers maintenance and repair concerns and managing a delivery schedule can compound into a nauseating career indeed  fortunately you don’t face these challenges alone  we’ve assembled a handful of tips to help you deal with common stressors as a professional trucker or delivery driver enhance your mood with music music is a powerful influencer and not necessarily with regard to the lyrics  the important factor to note is the style and speed of the music as this can either hype up your anxiety or relax and soothe you  stanford university study  shows shows that music at roughly  beats per minute bpm will allow your brainwaves to subconsciously synchronize with the music getting you into a calming rhythm without putting you to sleep  a simple yet effective way to take the edge off of a stressful route know your route often we’re asked to make new deliveries sometimes in areas we’re unfamiliar with  take a few minutes with a map ahead of time to identify the potentially troublesome areas and make mental or paper notes of landmarks or cross streets leading up to an important intersection in the age of the smartphone and gps it doesn’t hurt to set up the destination in your device but do note that sometimes road closures construction or redevelopment may be different than the latest map update in your device  it doesn’t hurt to also have mental notes of roads in the region as previously mentioned stay hydrated to combat stress many of us drink coffee or tea when we get up to get a caffeine jolt and when available we consume various forms of caffeine throughout the day  instead try starting your day with caffeine to get you moving but shift to water or a lowcalorie hydration drink  drinking water hydrates your organs including the brain helping it function optimally which in turn studies have shown decreases the concentration and production of cortisol the stress hormone  drinking water has numerous health benefits beyond coping with stress and the only down side is maybe a few more pit stops along the way—a welcome break to stretch picking the right partners a significant stressor for any business owner is finances  we want more than to simply keep the doors open we want to grow and thrive  with trucking a sizable portion of expense goes into our equipment and funding the purchase or lease of a new truck can be overwhelming  another way to beat stress as a trucker is to choose a truck and trailer financing company who knows the industry and is in your corner providing sensible financing options that will help you acquire the equipment you need to grow
