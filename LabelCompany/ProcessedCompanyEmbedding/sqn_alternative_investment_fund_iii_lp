infrastructure industry news march   sqn alternative investment fund iii lp  k  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations edgar glimpses via acquire media newsedge overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed on march   we operate a fund in which the capital invested by our limited partners is pooled together this pool of capital is then used to invest in businessessential revenueproducing or costsaving equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and in many cases associated revenue streams the pooled capital contributions are also used to pay fees and expenses associated with our organization and to fund a capital reserve our principal investment strategy is to invest in businessessential revenueproducing or costsavings equipment with high inplace value and long relative to the investment term economic life we expect to achieve our investment strategy by making investments in equipment already subject to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment which will include i purchasing equipment and leasing it to thirdparty end users ii providing equipment and other asset financing iii acquiring equipment subject to lease and iv acquiring ownership rights residual value interests in leased equipment at lease expiration from time to time we may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to our leasing customers many of our investments are and we anticipate will continue to be structured as full payout or operating leases full payout leases generally are leases under which the rent over the initial term of the lease will return our invested capital plus an appropriate return without consideration of the residual value and where the lessee may acquire the equipment or other assets at the expiration of the lease term operating leases generally are leases under which the aggregate noncancelable rental payments during the original term of the lease on a net present value basis are not sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equipment or other assets leased under the lease we commenced our operating period on june   with our first equipment transaction during the operating period we will invest most of the net offering proceeds in items of equipment that are subject to leases equipment financing transactions and residual ownership rights in leased equipment after the net offering proceeds are invested additional investments will be made with the cash proceeds generated from our initial investments to the extent that cash is not needed for expenses reserves or distributions to limited partners the investment in additional equipment in this manner is called reinvestment current business environment and outlook we believe that  will continue to present attractive opportunities for equipment lease and asset finance investments while interest rates have been at historical lows we expect rates to increase later in the year increasing interest rates generally result in increased returns on asset based investments but it also increases the cost of leverage so we do not see much of a net effect on our gross margins on the leverage portions of our portfolios our single investor leases and loans should benefit from any increase in interest rates over the long term in the short term we are seeing a lot of downward pressure on returns in certain of the asset classes that we have historically invested in in the united kingdom specifically alternative energy products tied to uk government subsidies such as solar installations and led lighting specialty finance firms have raised a tremendous amount of capital targeted toward these asset classes which has driven down financing rates across the sector the competitive environment is firming up with a few large participants exiting the market but with a growing number of well capitalized new participants prepared to absorb market share as the market settles we think there is more opportunity than there has been in years to acquire season portfolios of equipment leases we also think that there may be opportunity for consolidation in the next year or two overall we think that companies have a positive outlook for growth in  and we anticipate capital asset and equipment acquisition will be an essential part of that growth current industry trends according to the equipment leasing and finance foundations  equipment leasing and financing us economic outlook the us economy is expected to grow  in  the fastest pace since the  recession economic growth will be driven by a number of positive factors such as a strong housing market recovery falling natural gas prices robust auto sales record high household wealth steadily improving credit availability and improving employment however these positive trends are counterbalanced by high oil prices slow international growth moderating fiscal consolidation and the continued threat of policy uncertainty more dependable economic growth will help to generate stronger overall investment in equipment and software additionally a rising interest rate environment could induce companies to lock in lower rates overall these trends could yield a positive result for the equipment finance industry  recent significant transactions investment in sqn echo llc on december   we formed sqn echo llc echo a joint venture with an affiliate sqn aif iv lp fund iv to purchase a junior collateralized participation in two portfolios of various equipment leases echo paid approximately  in cash and

by delta recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to part ii item  financial statements and supplementary data note  summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements in our financial statements included in this annual report on form k critical accounting policies an understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our general partner and our investment manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates primarily include the determination of allowance for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment losses and the estimated useful lives and residual values of the leased equipment we acquire actual results could differ from those estimates  lease classification and revenue recognition each equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease which is determined at lease inception based upon the terms of each lease or when there are significant changes to the lease terms we capitalize initial direct costs associated with the origination and funding of lease assets initial direct costs include both internal costs eg labor and overhead and external broker fees incurred with the origination costs related to leases that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as incurred as acquisition expense for a finance lease initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the lease term using the effective interest rate method for an operating lease the initial direct costs are included as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term for finance leases we record at lease inception the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination the initial direct costs related to the lease if any and the related unearned income unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value minus the cost of the leased equipment unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method for operating leases rental income is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value rental income received in advance is the difference between the timing of the receivables billed and the income recognized on a straightline basis for leases subject to equipment notes receivable specific payment terms were reached requiring payments which resulted in the recognition of interest income this income is recognized over the course of the lease agreement our investment manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction as part of its process the investment committee determines the residual value if any to be used once the investment has been approved the factors considered in determining the residual value include but are not limited to the creditworthiness of the potential lessee the type of equipment considered how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessees business the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy the residual value assumes among other things that the asset is utilized normally in an open unrestricted and stable market shortterm fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets if held in quantity simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly the residual value is calculated using information from various external sources such as trade publications auction data equipment dealers wholesalers and industry experts as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators asset impairments the significant assets in our investment portfolio are periodically reviewed no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value if there is an indication of impairment we estimates the future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows if an impairment is determined to exist the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a longlived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the statement of operations in the period the determination is made the events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are i the estimated fair value of the underlying equipment is less than its carrying value ii the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and iii it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual value in the asset the preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates including the level of future rents or receipts from the sale of the residual value investment estimated downtime between releasing events and the amount of releasing costs the investment managers review for impairment will include a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third party appraisals published values for similar assets recent transactions for similar assets adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset  equipment notes receivable equipment notes receivable are reported in our balance sheets as the outstanding principal balance net of any unamortized deferred fees premiums or discounts on purchased loans costs to originate loans if any are reported as other assets in our balance sheets income is recognized over the life of the note agreement on certain equipment notes receivable specific payment terms were reached requiring prepayments which resulted in the recognition of unearned interest income unearned income discounts and premiums if any are amortized to interest income in the statements of operations using the effective interest rate method equipment notes receivable are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when payments are more than  days past due additionally the investment manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than  days based upon the investment managers judgment accounts may be placed in a nonaccrual status accounts on a nonaccrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable revenue on nonaccrual accounts is recognized only when cash has been received cost method of accounting we record our investment in sqn delta at cost under the cost method of accounting for investments dividends are the basis for recognition by an investor of earnings from an investment we recognize as income dividends received that are distributed from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition the net accumulated earnings of the investee subsequent to the date of investment are recognized by us only to the extent distributed by the investee as dividends dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions of cost of the investment delta recognized approximately  in investment income for its ownership of the participation agreement in the cargo ship portfolio we consolidate the activity of delta for financial reporting purposes equity method of accounting we record our investment in sqn echo using the equity method since we own a  investment in sqn echo according to generally accepted accounting principles a company that holds  or greater investment in another company could potentially exercise significant influence over the investee companys operating and financing activities and should therefore utilize the equity method of accounting depreciation we record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease in order to calculate depreciation we first determine the depreciable equipment cost which is the cost less the estimated residual value the estimated residual value is our estimate of the value of the equipment at lease termination depreciation expense is recorded by applying the straightline method of depreciation to the depreciable equipment cost over the lease term results of operations for the year ended december    versus the year ended december    at december   we were in both our offering period and our operating period our offering period terminated on march   after which time we no longer accepted limited partner capital contributions during the offering period the majority of our cash inflows were from limited partners purchasing our units after the termination of our offering period the majority of our cash inflows are expected to come from rental payments interest payments and sales proceeds from our various equipment investments  during our operating period we use the net offering proceeds to make our initial investments which include i purchasing equipment and leasing it to thirdparty end users ii providing equipment and other asset financing iii acquiring equipment subject to lease and iv acquiring ownership rights residual value interests in leased equipment at lease expiration as our investments mature we anticipate reinvesting the cash proceeds to the extent that the cash will not be needed for expenses reserves and distributions to our limited partners in additional investments in leased equipment and financing transactions additionally we expect to see our rental income and finance income increase as well as related expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense revenue for  and  is summarized as follows for the year ended december    revenue rental income     finance income   gain on asset sales   investment income from participation interest   interest income   total revenue   for the year ended december   we earned

transactions during  that did not exist in  we had a total of seventeen lessees in  from which we earned revenue versus nine lessees from which we earned revenue during  during  we increased our rental income by  this increase was due to the following i  of rental income earned by bravo which was formed in june  ii  of rental income earned by newly formed entity delta and iii during the year  one of the fund iii residual value investments expired and entered into a new operating lease earning  of rental income during  we increased our finance income by  from  this increase was due to the increase in finance lease transactions we entered into during  in fund iii and bravo at the start of  we had eight finance leases compared to the twelve finance leases we had at december   the  increase in interest income was due to an increase in equipment notes receivable advances made during the year earning approximately  of interest income one of these equipment notes was fully repaid during  resulting in approximately  annual return prorated for months outstanding in addition during  we purchased a convertible note which earned  of interest income we also earned  of investment income through our investment in sqn delta in which the partnership acquired a participation interest in an  portfolio of limited partnership interests in two newly commissioned shipping vessels under

partner we enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications our maximum exposure under these arrangements is not known in the normal course of business we enter into contracts of various types including lease contracts contracts for the sale or purchase of lease assets and management contracts it is prevalent industry practice for most contracts of any significant value to include provisions that each of the contracting parties in addition to assuming liability for breaches of the representations warranties and covenants that are part of the underlying contractual obligations to also assume an obligation to indemnify and hold the other contractual party harmless for such breaches and for harm caused by such partys gross negligence and willful misconduct including in certain instances certain costs and expenses arising from the contract generally to the extent these contracts are performed in the ordinary course of business under the reasonable business judgment of our general partner and our investment manager no liability will arise as a result of these provisions our general partner and our investment manager knows of no facts or circumstances that would make our contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial transactions between businesses accordingly we believe that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice and that any potential liability under our similar commitments is remote should any such indemnification obligation become payable we would separately record andor disclose such liability in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

primary economic benefits of ownership the partnership’s consolidation policy requires the consolidation of entities where a controlling financial interest is held as well as the consolidation of variable interest entities in which the partnership has the primary economic benefits all material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation                use of estimates – the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the general partner and investment manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates primarily include the determination of allowances for doubtful lease notes and loan accounts depreciation and amortization impairment losses estimated useful lives and residual values actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents – the partnership considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of funds maintained in checking and money market accounts held at financial institutions the partnership’s cash and cash equivalents are held principally at one financial institution in the united states of america and at times the balances may exceed federally insured limits   the partnership has placed these funds in an international financial institution in order to minimize risk relating to exceeding insured limits the partnership through summit asset management limited maintains an unrestricted bank account at a major financial institution in the united kingdom for purposes of receiving payments and funding transactions in pound sterling at september   the partnership did not have any cash and cash equivalents held in a bank in the united kingdom at december   the partnership had £  applying exchange rates at december   respectively of cash and cash equivalents held in two banks in the united kingdom   credit risk – in the normal course of business the partnership is exposed to credit risk credit risk is the risk that the partnerships’ counterparty to an agreement will at some point either have an inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments concentrations of credit risk with respect to lessees are dispersed across different industry segments throughout the united kingdom and the united states of america although the partnership does not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these lessees lease payments are dependent upon the financial stability of the industry segments in which they operate   asset impairments – assets in the partnership’s investment portfolio which are considered long lived assets are periodically reviewed no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value if there is an indication of impairment the partnership estimates the future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows if an impairment is determined to exist the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a longlived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the statement of operations in the period the determination is made the events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are i the estimated fair value of the underlying equipment is less than its carrying value ii the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and iii it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset the preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates including the level of future rents or receipts from the sale of the residual value investment estimated downtime between releasing events and the amount of releasing costs the investment manager’s review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third party appraisals published values for similar assets recent transactions for similar assets adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset                lease classification and revenue recognition – the partnership records revenue based upon the lease classification determined at the inception of the transaction and based upon the terms of the lease or when there are significant changes to the lease terms   the partnership leases equipment to third parties and each such lease may be classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease for a finance lease for an operating lease initial direct costs are included as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated   for finance leases the partnership records at lease inception the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment upon lease termination the initial direct costs if any related to the lease and the related unearned income unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value minus the cost of the leased equipment unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method   for operating leases rental income is recognized on the straight line basis over the lease term billed and uncollected operating lease receivables will be included in accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value rental income received in advance is the difference between the timing of the cash payments and the income recognized on the straight line basis   for leases subject to equipment notes receivable specific payment terms were reached requiring payments which resulted in the recognition of interest income this income is recognized over the course of the lease agreement   the investment manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease financing transaction and lease acquisition as part of this process it determines the unguaranteed residual value if any to be used once the acquisition has been approved the factors considered in determining the unguaranteed residual value include but are not limited to the creditworthiness of the potential lessee the type of equipment being considered how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee’s business the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates unguaranteed residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the partnership’s policy relating to impairment review   the residual value assumes among other things that the asset will be utilized normally in an open unrestricted and stable market shortterm fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets if held in quantity simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly the residual value is calculated using information from various external sources such as trade publications auction data equipment dealers wholesalers and industry experts as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators   finance lease receivables and allowance for doubtful lease notes and loan accounts — in the normal course of business the partnership provides credit or financing to its customers performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses these credit or financing transactions are normally collateralized by the equipment being financed in determining the amount of allowance for doubtful lease note and loan accounts the investment manager considers historical credit losses the past due status of receivables payment history and other customerspecific information including the value of the collateral the past due status of a receivable is based on its contractual terms expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance for doubtful lease note and loan accounts receivables are written off when the investment manager determines they are uncollectible at september   an allowance for doubtful lease notes and loan accounts is not currently provided since in the opinion of the investment manager all accounts recorded are deemed collectible                equipment notes receivable — equipment notes receivable are reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements as the outstanding principal balance net of any unamortized deferred fees premiums or discounts on purchased loans costs to originate loans if any are reported as other assets in the condensed consolidated financial statements income is recognized over the life of the note agreement on certain equipment notes receivable specific payment terms were reached requiring prepayments which resulted in the recognition of unearned interest income unearned income discounts and premiums if any are amortized to interest income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest rate method equipment notes receivable are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when payments are more than  days past due additionally the investment manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than  days based upon the investment manager’s judgment accounts may be placed in a nonaccrual status accounts on a nonaccrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and the partnership believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable revenue on nonaccrual accounts is recognized only when cash has been received   initial direct costs — the partnership capitalizes initial direct costs associated with the origination and funding of lease assets these costs are amortized on a lease by lease basis over the actual contract term of each lease using the effective interest rate method for finance leases and the straightline method for operating leases upon disposal of the underlying lease assets both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved costs related to leases that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as incurred as acquisition expense   cost method — the partnership records its investment in participation interests at cost under the cost method of accounting for investments dividends are the basis for recognition by an investor of earnings from an investment the partnership recognizes as income dividends received that are distributed from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition the net accumulated earnings of the investee subsequent to the date of investment are recognized by the partnership only to the extent distributed by the investee as dividends dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the investment   income taxes — as a partnership no provision for income taxes is recorded since the liability for such taxes is that of each of the partners rather than the partnership the partnership’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the federal and state taxing authorities and changes if any could adjust the individual income tax of the partners   per share data — net income or loss attributable to limited partners per weighted average number of limited partnership interests outstanding is calculated as follows the net income or loss allocable to the limited partners divided by the weighted average number of limited partnership interests outstanding during the period   foreign currency transactions — the partnership has designated the united states of america dollar as the functional currency for the partnership’s investments denominated in foreign currencies accordingly certain assets and liabilities are translated at either the reporting period exchange rates or the historical exchange rates revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period and all transaction gains or losses are reflected in the period’s results of operations   depreciation — the partnership records depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease in order to calculate depreciation the partnership first determines the depreciable equipment cost which is the cost less the estimated residual value the estimated residual value is the estimate of the value of the equipment at lease termination depreciation expense is recorded by applying the straightline method of depreciation to the depreciable equipment cost over the lease term which varies from one to five years                recent accounting pronouncements   in february  the
