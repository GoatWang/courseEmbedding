range cc cash c million total liabilities c million the hottest province for mining exploration is not ontario quebec or even the yukon it is actually newfoundland where a staking rush has quietly taken over the province until now newfoundland has largely been overlooked but definitely not for its geology much of the island was simply inaccessible accompanied by an archaic concession system that locked up much of the land until the s most of the roads in newfoundland was limited to the coastal areas where the majority of the population lived this is true with the railroad as well built in the late s it followed the coast with the occasional cut across a peninsula where it was easier to build the reid newfoundland company founded by sir robert gillespie reid of scotland built newfoundland’s railroad in  as a condition of operating the railway reid was compensated with  acres of crown land per mile operated in  reid was commissioned to build another railway and similar to the first contract was compensated  acres of land for every mile he built the railway opened up vast tracts of land spurring interest in newfoundland’s natural resources reid was the primary benefactor eventually owning  acres including the timber mineral and surface rights these “reid lots” were akin to modern day patented claims and made the reid newfoundland company the largest landowners in the province he became a pulp and paper as well as mining tycoon until the mids the newfoundland concession system granted companies large areas of land that included exclusivity companies can only explore so much thus the majority of the land under the concession system remained untouched and unexplored it was not until the mids the last of the concessions was finally released including the “reid lots” which were taxed away or converted to claims with the other concessions with such a small group holding onto the majority of the prospective land for decades its no wonder newfoundland remained underexplored through the various gold cycles richmont mines – leaving a lot of gold behind in may  richmont mines tseric mkt cap cm made its foray into newfoundland first acquiring a  interest in the nugget pond gold project then the remaining  in january  after spending  million in development work the nugget pond gold mine is located on the baie verte peninsula of newfoundland spanning  acres on december   the ore reserves totaled  tons at a grade of  gt source rambler metals nugget pond began commercial production in april  and produced a total of  ounces depleting its reserves by  having a perfectly good mill richmont mines simply needed more feed in anticipation of the depletion at nugget pond richmont acquired the nearby hammerdown property in march  for  millionincluding work performed by richmont hammerdown saw close to  drill holes over  meters  a trenching program led to the discovery of another deposit in rumbullion hammerdown was subsequently mined between  during which a total of  tonnes of ore were mined and milled at an average grade of  gt au recovering a total of  ounces of gold richmont opted to cease production due to low gold prices  per ounce even with mineralization remaining fast forward to present day the ore and mill still remain and maritime resources is poised to restart production and further explore the green bay gold property which in addition to hammerdown is home to three more deposits and over  million ounces of gold resources green bay property  the nugget pond mill source corporate presentation hammerdown – aftertax npv of  million – optimization  exploration upside coming maritime originally acquired  of the green bay property from commander resources in  through the issuance of  million shares and by spending  on the property in  maritime exercised its option to acquire  through the issuance of  million more shares the nugget pond mill is now owned and operated by rambler metals a company maritime has an engineering and evaluation study agreement with that agreement includes the first right for toll milling it is important to note that rambler acquired  million shares of maritime in february  and owns  of the company it is in the best interest of rambler to see maritime to production the company recently released a pfs study on hammerdown which was headlined by an aftertax irr of  and npv of  million producing  ounces per year for  years the study confirms that hammerdown is not just viable but very economic in today’s gold environment due to the existing mill there is low upfront capital and a very short rampup to gold production and since the operation is scheduled to run at  tpd over a fiveyear period permitting for the reopening will be straightforward it will not require federal government’s blessing hammerdown currently has  ounces of gold in reserves but also has another  ounces of inferred that can be converted with more drilling as mentioned earlier the green bay property has three other deposits that will be utilized in the future orion muddy shag hammerdown  rumbullion source maritime resources the rumbullion deposit remains open for at least  meters to the northeast with gold veins exposed and tested on surface the hammerdown deposit is faultedoffset to the southwest and is untested at  meters at depth lastly the orion deposit is

hottest province for mining exploration is not ontario quebec or even the yukon it is actually newfoundland where a staking rush has quietly taken over the province until now newfoundland has largely been overlooked but definitely not for its geology much of the island was simply inaccessible accompanied by an archaic concession system that locked up much of the land until the s most of the roads in newfoundland was limited to the coastal areas where the majority of the population lived this is true with the railroad as well built in the late s it followed the coast with the occasional cut across a peninsula where it was easier to build the reid newfoundland company founded by sir robert gillespie reid of scotland built newfoundland’s railroad in  as a condition of operating the railway reid was compensated with  acres of crown land per mile operated in  reid was commissioned to build another railway and similar to the first contract was compensated  acres of land for every mile he built the railway opened up vast tracts of land spurring interest in newfoundland’s natural resources reid was the primary benefactor eventually owning  acres including the timber mineral and surface rights these “reid lots” were akin to modern day patented claims and made the reid newfoundland company the largest landowners in the province he became a pulp and paper as well as mining tycoon until the mids the newfoundland concession system granted companies large areas of land that included exclusivity companies can only explore so much thus the majority of the land under the concession system remained untouched and unexplored it was not until the mids the last of the concessions was finally released including the “reid lots” which were taxed away or converted to claims with the other concessions with such a small group holding onto the majority of the prospective land for decades its no wonder newfoundland remained underexplored through the various gold cycles richmont mines –

includes the first right for toll milling it is important to note that rambler acquired  million shares of maritime in february  and owns  of the company it is in the best interest of rambler to see maritime to production the company recently released a pfs study on hammerdown which was headlined by an aftertax irr of  and npv of  million producing  ounces per year for  years the study confirms that hammerdown is not just viable but very economic in today’s gold environment due to the existing mill there is low upfront capital and a very short rampup to gold production and since the operation is scheduled to run at  tpd over a fiveyear period permitting for the reopening will be straightforward it will not require federal government’s blessing hammerdown currently has  ounces of

the western segment of the deposit orion west drilling by maritime resources in  between the two zones confirmed continuity of gold mineralization making orion at least  metres long in strike extent the deposit is completely open down plunge to the northeast property geology and gold vein systems the green bay property is host to  gold deposits these four zones are contained within a  kilometre long deformationstrain zone locally called the hammerdown deformation zone the hammerdown deformation zone is superimposed on or near the northern boundary of a small greenstone belt the catchers pond greenstone belt consists of a series of lower ordovician felsic to mafic volcanics interbedded with sequences of fine grained arenaceous and chemical sediments it is located in northcentral newfoundland in a mineralrich district the greenstones are related to the buchans greenstones located  km to the south which produced base and precious metals from rich volcanogenic deposits for over  years the green bay gold deposits lie within a northeast trending  metre wide high strain zone structural corridor of strong ductile to brittle shearing that can be traced from orion northeastward for approximately four kilometres this structural corridor hosts the hammerdown rumbullion muddy shag and orion gold deposits plus several other gold mineralized zones as shown on figs  and  the corridor straddles the contact between the catchers pond group and the hammerdown basalt though is mainly developed within the uppermost units of the catchers pond group several detailed structural studies at the hammerdown and rumbullion gold deposits have been undertaken dubé et al  gaboury et al  the results of which are applicable to orion and muddy shag as well click to enlarge green bay property geology with gold and base metal deposits click to enlarge the hammerdown gold deposit hammerdownrumbullionmuddy shag vein system the hammerdown gold deposit consists of a series of stacked gold vein zones situated within a  metre long section of an  metre long shear zone in the northern portion of the hammerdown deformation zone its eastern boundary is the rumbullion fault a northeasterly trending fault to the east of which is the rumbullion gold zone which hosts several narrow high grade gold vein zones to the west the hammerdown vein system pinches out approximately  metres to the southwest of a strong flexure in the shear zone which rotates the shear from eastwest at hammerdown to southwesterly this southwest trending shear extends for several hundred metres and hosts the muddy shag gold zone containing two or three gold veins at depth the entire shear zone including most gold zones are cut off by the extensive captain nemo fault which is a north dipping normal fault with some strike slip movement geological interpretation indicates downdrop of the hammerdown area to be several hundred metres as the captain nemo fault cuts through the hammerdown shear at an oblique angle veins are cut off at depths varying from  to  metres click to enlarge the hammerdown gold vein system at hammerdown a total of nine gold bearing veins have shown sufficient grade and continuity to be included in reserves an additional six to eight small or weak vein systems have been identified in the hammerdown zone several of these have developed into small ore shoots at rumbullion seven veins have ore lenses along part of their strike extent the gold bearing veins consist essentially of vein quartz with  percent pyrite occurring as massive stringers and dense disseminations base metal sulphides total about one percent with zinc content equalling combined copper and lead values minor bismuth occurs as native metal as well as the sulphosalt hammarite gold is intimately associated with all sulphide phases occurring as discrete grains within sulphides at sulphide grain boundaries and occasionally in quartz fractures near sulphide grains there is a direct relationship between sulphide content and gold grade in veins the gold is always fine grained with  percent being of grain size less than  microns and the largest grain size is slightly over  microns considering the high grades relatively little visual gold occurs in the deposit at hammerdown the main vein systems designated ml and m are respectively located along the north and south contacts of a fairly continuous dyke felsic porphyry body with the enclosing sheared mafic volcanics the m vein is the stronger of the two in places offshoot veins within the porphyry close to the m vein are included in m reserves the hammerdown hangingwall veins designated from south to north n  p and q mostly occur in relatively undeformed mafic volcanics with a minor iron formation component and leucoxenebearing mafic dykes other felsic porphyry sillsdykes are present but do not influence the siting of the veins like the porphyry associated with ml and m the veins have longer strike lengths compared to the main veins the footwall veins labelled from north to south l k and j are hosted by strongly sheared mafic and felsic volcanics invaded by felsic porphyry sills at least four other vein sets li kl k jl are present as with the main zone the porphyries play a significant role in localizing the veining with the strongest veins occurring along the southern contact of the sills dips are

steep to the north just east of the rumbullion fault the rumbullion vein system continues in an easterly direction for about  metres where an abrupt flexure rotates the vein system sharply to the northeast at the regional  degree direction the vein system continues to the ne for at least  metres however the number ore lenses seems to reduce in this direction mainly due to lack of drilling the veins also separate further to the east making them more difficult to explore and define this  metre strike length with several known veins over a  metre stratigraphic section has significant exploration opportunity this area is swamp covered yet has a number of gold soil anomalies and has not been covered with detailed em surveys the captain nemo fault also splits into a north and south

extending over  metres muddy shag gold veins at muddy shag two subvertical dipping quartz vein zones with a strike of oare hosted within moderately to strongly sheared mafic to felsic volcaniclastics and minor black cherty sediments both zones are goldbearing although of lower grade than hammerdown and rumbullion two main vein zones mm mm show significant vertical and lateral geological continuity within which several lenses reach ore grades a third vein the j vein is present only in the eastern region of muddy shag near the hammerdown flexure and yields exceptionally high gold values muddy shag contains an inferred resource of  tonnes grading  gt au or  ounces gold the orion gold deposit click to enlargegeology of the orion gold deposit orion gold deposit geology stratigraphy the orion gold deposit is situated at the southern portion of the hammerdown deformation zone and is hosted by strongly deformed steeply dipping metavolcanic and metasedimentary units a major reverse fault zone horsehead fault has thrust this assemblage over younger volcanics to the west this northerly striking fault dips  to the east and terminates the orion gold zones to the west as the fault trends oblique to the ne strike of the orion vein system the base of the gold zones plunge about  to the northeast recent drilling has encountered high grade gold in the veins close to the fault indicating a possible structural relationship of high grade gold with the plunge of the horsehead fault the orion gold veins are completely open in this plunge direction and to the east intruding the stratigraphy are numerous silllike lenses of quartzfeldspar porphyry up to  metres thick and a myriad of mafic dykes and sills up to  metres thick structure and alteration the rocks hosting the deposit have undergone a protracted history of complex deformation including both folding and brittle faulting at least three deformational events influenced vein emplacement and overall geometry of the mineralized zones click to enlargecross section along l w of orion gold deposit looking grid west discovery vein zone the discovery zone as the name suggests was the first to be discovered at the deposit the zone is situated near the transition from the mixed maficfelsic schist see crosssection fig  this vein zone consists of single to multiple cm quartzcalcite veins mainly cm with  pyrite locally to  and minor amounts of light coloured sphalerite and chalcopyrite one vein bb contained  grains of visible gold but otherwise visible gold is generally rare the hosting schists often have a distinct yellow ochre sericite developed adjacent to the veining silicification is also common geochemically the zone has twice the zinc and copper content compared to the orion main zone but similar though very low amounts of silver and lead click to enlargeorion gold vein system oblique plan view main vein zone the main vein zone is situated within the final felsic schist generally  metres northwest of the discovery zone like the discovery zone it can be traced along strike for  metres the zone consists of multiple cm quartzcalcite veins mainly cm and strong patchy silicification with  disseminated pyrite up to  and minor though locally abundant chalcopyrite and sphalerite visible gold was observed in two drill holes the host schists are strongly sericitic silicified and locally display salmoncoloured bleaching ems zone the ems zone is the smallest of the three significant zones at the deposit like the discovery and main zones it is contained within a distinct stratigraphic interval in this case the graphitic cherty sedimentsvolcanic turbidite unit the zone has a much shorter strike of  metres while better grade mineralization is confined to only about a  metre strike between  and  metres below surface the zone occurs approximately  metres southeast of the discovery zone the grade x thickness longitudinal section shows a slightly steeper easterly plunge ° compared to the two zones described above gold exploration potential untested gold potential  rumbullion to lochinvar click to enlarge a hammerdownrumbullion eastern extension the hammerdownrumbullion vein system has significant gold exploration potential eastward from its current resource delimitation early drill testing of eastward extending rumbullion veins when gold prices ranged from   ounce found less and less ore grade zones exploration drilling therefore ended in this direction in the midlate s when richmont reached out to mine the higher grade lenses at east rumbullion in the early s with gold prices still low the cost of long haulage drifts soon overcame profitability of mining the extended lenses and their exploration in this direction ceased at the eastern end of the property major general resources discovered several continuous gold veins north of the lochinvar base metal deposit and encountered some relatively high grade gold intersections a small gold resource  oz was calculated for one of these veins but shelved due to low gold prices these lochinvar hanging wall veins see map above are identical to rumbullion veins and occur in the same structure and rock sequences scattered drill holes between rumbullion and lochinvar veins have encountered narrow gold veins so the system is known to be continuous it is therefore considered likely that additional gold resources can be developed in this  metre long extension east of hammerdownrumbullion veins drilling here will be shallow near surface holes b orion deeps extension maritimes first drill program at green bay in  significantly increased gold resources at the orion deposit this drilling not only closed the gap between the old orion east and west zones it also encountered some of the highest grade gold intervals at orion this new drilling when combined with earlier drill results clearly shows a higher grade gold zone plunging northeasterly at about  degrees as this plunge direction is parallel to a strong regional fault for several hundred metres it is considered that the two controls are related the orion downplunge gold opportunity is completely open at depth and has never been drill tested a deep drill hole program is required to test the extent of the orion deposit to the northeast c hammerdown down fault block the possible extension of the hammerdown gold deposit has always been limited by the captain nemo fault which removed the lower extension of the vein system in an unknown direction the veins are terminated between  m and  m depth by this very sharp fault fragments of the ore grade veins were actually encountered in the fault during mining operations by richmont mines however they only drilled two deep holes in search for continuation of the veins the direction and distance of the fault offset has never been resolved however geological and magnetic mapping of the property indicates it has not been moved more than several s of metres in late  maritime completed a deep searching geophysical survey to the south of the captain nemo fault and located a target at depth there has been preliminary testing of this target and it remains available for
