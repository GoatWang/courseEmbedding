cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn

transforming health care improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc in fact research has shown nearly twothirds of nslcs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers like dr zeiher  percent of medications currently in the

patients thrive share tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are

what happenedshares of inovio pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq ino a clinicalstage biotech with a focus on cancer and infectious diseases fell  during wednesdays session an announcement on tuesday that outlined an upcoming share offering didnt sit well with the marketso what  without any approved drugs to sell inovio needs to fund its operations with debt or equity although there wasnt any longterm debt on the companys balance sheet it decided to visit the equity tap once again the company intends to raise a combined  million from the public and the offerings underwriters which at todays closing price would raise its outstanding share count roughly  higherimage source getty imagesraising equity to fund new drug development is standard practice in this industry but inovio has been doing it for a long time inovios share count has risen about  over the past decade which means longterm shareholders slice of any future profits has been reduced to a tiny slivernow whatinovio sparked a rally in may after announcing positive earlystage results for its experimental hiv vaccine more recently news that the fda would allow the companys only latestage clinical trial to continue lifted the stock a bit further beyond these two the company has more candidates in clinicalstage development than most biotechs several times its size which isnt cheap inovio recorded research and development expenses of  million during the first three months of the year alonethe company received about  million in the form of grants and collaboration revenue but it still burned through  million during the first quarter adding the likely proceeds of this upcoming share offering to whatever remains of the  million in cash and shortterm investments on its balance sheet at the end of march will lengthen its runway somewhat until inovio has an application ready to submit to the fda though investors should remain braced for more share offerings ahead  stocks we like better than inovio pharmaceuticalswhen

announced the publication of data from a preclinical study of the companys plasmid dnaencoded monoclonal antibody dmab to protect against influenza infections results showed that a single dose of two dmab products targeting influenza a and b provided complete protection in mice from a lethal challenge with multiple viruses  these dmab products are in contrast to dna vaccines which would incite the production of antibodies through the immune system  while a dmab product could provide immediate and shortterm protection a dna vaccine may provide longterm immune memory and protection thus these two categories of approaches may complement each other phase  trial for inovios vgx in cervical dysplasia gets fda goahead  now that the fda has lifted its clinical hold on phase  study of inovio

highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesions in the wake of this update we reiterate our buy rating jason mccarthy maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced that the clinical hold on the phase iii program evaluating vgx for the treatment of cervical dysplasia has been lifted and the company will immediately begin enrolling patients  while inovio has continued to advance multiple earlierstage dnabased immunotherapies forward providing incremental catalysts for the stock our focus has remained on the start of the phase iii program for vgx in highgrade cervical dysplasia  vgx is the key driver of inovio with the clinical hold now lifted inovio has transformed into a pivotal company ram selvaraju hc wainwright  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced the second collaboration study involving the company�s ino tcell activating immunotherapy  genentech a member of roche holding ag will supply tecentriq to be used in combination with ino and ino in an openlabel phase b trial

that its hiv vaccine evoked almost  immune response rates in a clinical study  inovio�s share price has outperformed the zacks categorized medical  biomedical and genetics industry in the past one year    evaluated participants demonstrated an env specific antibody response these responses were not observed in any of the participants treated with a placebo  the governmentsponsored study conducted by inovio and its collaborators was funded through a  million niaid contract awarded in  with an additional grant of  million in  for the development of a hiv vaccine ram selvaraju hc wainwright  co  inovio pharmaceuticals announced that its hiv vaccine pennvaxgp had produced an antibody humoral immune response as well as a t cell cellular immune response in a phase  trial in healthy and uninfected adults  these early results are very encouraging but not surprising as they are in line with results from the companys trials of other dna vaccines including ebola zika and mers  we believe further studies would be conducted to determine whether pennvaxgp can safely and effectively prevent hiv infection the motley fool  shares of inovio pharmaceuticals inc gained as much as  today due to a positive earlystage readout for its experimental hiv vaccine called pennvaxgp  this experimental hiv vaccine just produced some of the strongest immune responses ever observed in a human clinical trial  if inovio can capture even a sliver of this multibilliondollar market it would be a ginormous win for shareholders especially in light of the companys present market cap of only  million  inovio may be able to monetize this promising clinical asset sooner rather than later stay tuned jason mccarthy maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced that pennvaxgp a dnabased hiv vaccine demonstrated  immune response rates in healthy subjects including both t cell and b cell antibody responses  the immune responses demonstrated by pennvaxgp are among the highest responses shown for an hiv vaccine  inovio now has a more clear path forward in the hiv space and the stage is set for a larger clinical program   we are focused on the vgx program and the start of the p program in cervical dysplasia which we expect in mid charles duncan piper jaffray  co  inovio pharmaceuticals incs ino can induce a tcell response in a small group of hpvassociated hn cancers we see this as positive proofofconcept data for the mechanistic rationale underlying inovios platform technology but we appear a long way from latestage clinical efficacy data in this and other tumor types  we expect medimmune to begin an openlabel phase ii study of �  durvalumab in q jason mccarthy maxim group  the key driver for inovio pharmaceuticals inc in our view remains vgx  the company announced that medimmune has initiated a combination study of medio vgx  il and durvalumab pdl in metastatic head and neck cancer inovio also initiated a p program of vgx in vulvar precancer  inovio continues to advance multiple immunotherapy studies forward which should provide incremental catalysts for the stock as data emerges zacks equity research  inovio pharmaceuticals incs vgx an hpv immunotherapy

pharmaceuticals inc is generating data with the cellectra� psp delivery device in order to satisfy the fdas requirement regarding the shelflife of its disposable components so that the clinical hold on the phase  pivotal study of vgx for the treatment of hpv related high grade cervical dysplasia could be lifted  we note that vgx would be the first candidate within the companys extensive pipeline to enter a pivotal study in the wake of this update we reiterate our buy rating and  price target jason mccarthy maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals incs vgx study should start in h multiple catalysts

throughout  we are upgrading to a buy rating charles duncan piper jaffray  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc reported q revenues of m rd of m and sga of m revenues and rd were slightly above our projections  the biotech indices demonstrated positive growth in the last month perhaps representing a relief rally strong fundamental stories can clearly still deliver value creation despite a noisy political environment and drug pricing pressures zacks equity research  inovio pharmaceuticals incs vgx is the most advanced candidate in the company�s pipeline  it now expects the program to be delayed until the first half of  pending resolution of the fda�s requests  apart from vgx inovio has several other candidates in its pipeline in early to midstage development  the company is working on the development of ebola zika and middle east respiratory syndrome virus vaccines  investor focus should remain on pipeline updates as many such events are lined up along with the company�s plans related to the development of its ebola and zika vaccines ram selvaraju hc wainwright  co  preliminary data show immune responses in  of zikavaccinated and  of mersvaccinated human subjects  both

the prevention of mers and zika infections which have no approved vaccines or treatments   earlier this month inovio entered into a license agreement that provides apollobio corporation with the exclusive right to develop and commercialize vgx in greater china jason mccarthy maxim group  the data generated from inovio pharmaceutical incs advance of earlierstage dnabased vaccines like the mers and zika vaccines are positives but in our view represent only incremental catalysts our focus remains on vgx and the start of the pivotal program in cervical dysplasia  end of phase ii meetings with both the fda and ema have given inovio a path forward for a pivotal study of vgx in hpv related cervical dysplasia inovio is in the process of finalizing the trial protocol and details  inovio

this trial was recently put on hold due to a stability issue with updated disposable parts  the issue should be easily resolvable the company anticipates a resolution by year end but does delay the start of the trial by three to six months  the company has a large portfolio of cancer immunotherapy targets including head  neck and prostate ino psma and psa both of which will read out phase i data in q nick hodges early advantage  inovio pharmaceuticals inc took a slide after the fda placed a hold on its proposed phase iii program for vgx  the program hadnt started nor had patients been recruited and for assurance the fda has not cancelled the study it has simply requested more information which inovio will supply  expect the phase iii study to advance after this brief delay the motley fool keith speights  inovios stock was slammed recently by the fdas decision to place a clinical hold on a planned latestage study of experimental cervical dysplasia vaccine vgx  i think this shouldnt be a huge setback for inovio  the primary catalysts that could help inovios stock rebound include a green light from the fda to move forward with testing vgx and positive news from inos zika vaccine  i wont be surprised if both catalysts combine to help the biotechs stock double by this time next year ram selvaraju hc wainwright  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc currently estimates that the fdarequested data should be available in december  and the phase  study should be initiated in h instead of q as originally planned though this clinical hold is a bump in the road it does not change our overall view on the efficacy and safety of vgx in treating high grade cervical dysplasia nor does it have a meaningful impact on our valuation of the product  we reiterate our buy rating and  price target jason mccarthy maxim group  inovio announced that the fda has placed a clinical hold on the proposed phase iii study of vgx in patients with hpvrelated cervical dysplasia a formal letter from the fda with complete information regarding the clinical hold is expected within  days  our focus continues to be on vgx and the start of the pivotal program as the next major event now potentially in  charles duncan piper jaffray  co  this morning inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced that its phase iii program of vgx in cervical dysplasia has been placed on clinical hold the hold is due to fda�s request for additional data on its cellectra delivery device  if the request is limited to additional data from cellectra parts we believe the program can get back on track fairly quickly with a trial initiation as soon as h as inovio had already begun pretrial activities such as site selection and early site preparation zacks equity research  inovio pharmaceuticals inc is working on a preventive zika vaccine  the company recently started a study on the vaccine in puerto rico where the zika virus outbreak has been declared a public health emergency  this is the second zika vaccine study being conducted by inovio and its collaborators the first study is being conducted in sites across the us and canada with results due by year end  positive data would allow the company to meet regulatory authorities next year to determine the development path forward jason kolbert maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced the initiation of a small clinical study of its zika vaccine gls being developed with geneone life sciences in puerto rico it is estimated by the cdc that the zika virus could infect more than  of the population of puerto rico by ye  with the zika virus spreading including to the us there remains an urgent need for a vaccine inovio continues to demonstrate that the companys dnabased vaccine approach is safe and can rapidly transition to human studies  more data from the gls studies should emerge later this year ram selvaraju hc wainwright  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced that it has initiated a second clinical study of its preventive zika vaccine gls in puerto rico where zika virus infections have been declared a public health emergency this trial follows the companys first human trial of gls in the us and canada which was initiated in june  and has fully enrolled and dosed  subjects  the successful development of a preventive zika vaccine could meet the immediate needs of regions with high infection rates and provide additional upside to our current  price target and reiterate our buy rating jason kolbert maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced that the phase i study of ino ebola vaccine in healthy subjects will expand to include  more subjects to determine the best immunization strategy using intradermal vaccination  intradermal administration has been shown in several inovio studies to be more effective at driving antigenspecific antibody responses antibodies are critical for clearing viral infections as they bind to and neutralize viral particles in the circulation as well as viral antigens on infected cells to either kill them directly or label them for other immune cells to come in and kill them ram selvaraju rodman  renshaw  inovio pharmaceuticals inc reported its q financial results total revenue was m beating our projection due to an increase in development payments from the company�s darpa ebola grant  importantly management has indicated that both the fda and the european medicines agency ema have provided an affirmative path for vgx to treat hpvrelated highgrade cervical dysplasia in a pivotal phase  registration study  this is encouraging news in our view charles duncan piper jaffray  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc ended the quarter with m in cash we project this cash will fund pipeline progress through h inclusive of significant progress on the soontostart phase  in cervical dysplasia and advancement to latestage trials for a broadening set of infectious disease and oncology programs including zika mers cervical cancer with medimmune and potentially other tumors  in advance of increasingly visible clinical progress expected across the platform over the next  months we reiterate ow overweight rating charles duncan piper jaffray  co  we remain encouraged specifically for the correlation between in vivo generation of antigenspecific cd tcells and clinical response observed in the phase iib trial with vgx in cd  this study has informed phase iii plans

pharmaceuticals inc has the ability to respond quickly to these mutations utilizing a proprietary dna based sequencing model designed to target and treat specific areas of cancer and infectious disease  inovio is the only immunotherapy company that has reported generating tcells in vivo in high quantity that are fully functional and whose killing capacity correlates with relevant clinical outcomes with a favorable safety profile  the next six months will be a busy period for investors to digest with several data sets slated for public dissemination  an investment in the longterm future for inovio is a solid investment choice jason kolbert maxim group  inovio continues to demonstrate that its dnabased vaccination platform can transition from preclinical to clinical in a relatively short period of time the ability to respond quickly to a rapidly emerging public health threat like zika virus zika is now present in  countries with a dnabased vaccine candidate could be an ideal approach for controlling disease spread sadif research  inovio pharmaceuticals inc is a high quality company with a neutral outlook inovio has strong business growth  when compared to its closest peer ani pharmaceuticals inc inovio shows greater undervaluation and is equally likely to outperform the market  the companys share price has risen sharply over the past year but we believe underlying fundamentals to be the primary determinant of longterm performance biotech research group seeking alpha  inovio pharmaceuticals inc in collaboration with geneone life sciences has found itself in an enviable position as the leader in developing a vaccine to combat the prolific zika virus  the vaccine resulted in seroconversion which is the development of detectable and specific antibodies in the

zika jason mccarthy maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals incs zika vaccine candidate generated robust antizika immune responses in nonhuman primates human trials to follow  the vaccine induced seroconversion with the production of antizika antibodies as well as antizika t cells responses this is positive as it suggests the immune system is being activated  inovio continues to show a robust vaccine development platform that is both rapid and flexible that can play a vital role in the world of vaccines as these crisis ebola mers and now zika emerge as threats ram selvaraju hc wainwright  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced its q financial results total revenues were m most of which were development payments from the darpa ebola grant  importantly inovio announced that it held meetings last month with both the fda and the european medicines agency to discuss the phase  results of vgx for the treatment of hpv related high grade cervical dysplasia and the design of the pivotal phase  trial for this candidate  the company is finalizing details for the trial and is on track to commence the phase  study in  we reiterate our buy rating and  price target charles duncan piper jaffray  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc recently reported positive interim data from the ebola phase i study triggering additional funding from the m darpa grant and its zika vaccine is still guided to enter the clinic by ye in advance of increasingly visible clinical execution in both immunotherapy and infectious diseases we reiterate our overweight rating and  price target jason mccarthy maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc continues to advance multiple programs forward and is heading towards a pivotal trial this year vgx in our opinion the data flow from multiple studies in

from bioject medical technologies  in addition inovio has been recently granted a k award to develop the noninvasive needlefree technology from the us army small business innovation research program  the needlefree platform will continue to be developed and in the longterm could be a paradigm shifting technology in vaccine delivery for vaccinating large populations rapidly and more costeffectively jason mccarthy maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced a partnership with both the national cancer institute and mayo clinic to develop ino a dnabased immunotherapy targeting hcv  what differentiates inovios immunotherapies is that the t cells generated are active and specific for the antigens that were encoded in the vaccine  while the hcv space has been dominated by blockbuster antivirals like harvoni and sovaldi their high cost is and will likely remain a factor that limits access  a more costeffective alternative would be a vaccine approach like ino which beyond initial viral elimination would also induce immune memory potentially guarding against reinfection ram selvaraju hc wainwright  co  inovio pharmaceuticals inc expects to initiate human trials of its zika virus vaccine gls by the end of   in late march  the company announced that its ebola vaccine ino had generated strong t cell and antibody responses in a phase  study of  healthy subjects  these

group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc continues to drive multiple oncology programs forward including vgx which is heading to phase  for hpvdriven cervical dysplasia in mid the immune data from vgx and early data from ino gives us confidence that combination studies with medimmune could generate similar if not more robust responses jason kolbert maxim group  inovio pharmaceuticals inc announced preclinical data showing that a dnabased monoclonal antibody dmabs targeting the chikungunya virus induced  protection against lethal challenge in mice  the dmab approach offers the potential for rapid protection to clear the virus during an outbreak a dnabased vaccine could then be administered to induce permanent longterm protection from reinfection inovio is developing both platforms and its not just for chikv its also for ebola and other viruses biotech research group seeking alpha  inovio has positioned itself for a transformative year in   demonstrating the ability to attract major

and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall

granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan
