positive cnh d class a affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class a affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class a affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class b upgraded to aaasf from aasf outlook revised to stable from positive key rating drivers the affirmation of the class a notes in both transactions reflects loss coverage levels consistent with the current ratings the upgrades to the class b notes is largely attributable to growing hard credit enhancement ce levels since close and strong loss performance to date both transactions are forecasting below fitchs initial base case loss proxies the outlook stable designation for all notes reflects fitchs expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the transactions amortize rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxies which would impact available loss coverage lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transactions the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to x
