battle road research ltd operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the cognex first quarter  earnings call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionand answer session and instructions will follow at that time as a reminder this conference is being recorded id like to introduce your host for todays conference john curran chief financial officer sir you may begin john j curran  cognex corp thank you and good evening everyone im john curran cognexs new cfo with me on todays call are dr bob shillman cognexs chairman and rob willett cognexs president and ceo id like to point out that our earnings release and quarterly report on form q are available on the cognex website at wwwcognexcom both contain highly detailed information about our financial results during the call we may use a nongaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to nongaap in exhibit  of the earnings release any forwardlooking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based on information that we believe to be true as of today things often change and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated you should refer to the companys sec filings including our most recent form k for a detailed list of these risk factors now id like to turn the call over to dr bob dr robert j shillman  cognex corp yeah thanks john and hello everyone welcome to our first quarter conference call for  as shown in the news release that we issued just today cognex reported simply outstanding results for q of  we set new records for first quarter revenue net income and earnings per share and we were highly profitable reporting an aftertax margin of an incredible  helped of course by significant tax savings right now im in our san diego office and everyone else on the call is in our natick headquarters so for details of the quarter im going to hand the microphone back to my partner rob willett and i will stay on the line and ill be available to answer any questions you may have for me at the end of the call during the qa rob the microphone is yours robert j willett  cognex corp thank you dr bob good evening everyone im pleased with our start to  our results were significantly better than the already strong guidance we gave to investors in february demand from all major regions strengthened even more than expected as we moved through the quarter we also made substantial progress by increasing the number of large customers in consumer electronics and logistics as a result q revenue grew  yearonyear and we reported operating margin expansion and an earnings increase revenue also grew on a sequential basis which is contrary to our typical seasonal experience in q our willingness to consistently invest in rd is paying off since the beginning of the year we introduced important new products that will help drive future growth the new cognex products hitting the market today are more powerful and easier to use than ever before we launched the new insight  series the next generation of our highly successful vision systems product line were pleased with the very positive early reviews the insight  is receiving from initial customers and distributors incorporating our most advanced vision tools like patmax redline the insight  delivers marketleading performance is simple to set up and has flexible image acquisition capabilities for todays increasingly complex production processes we also introduced insight profiler our first d product to leverage the successful insight software platform insight easybuilder is an intuitive interface that can be used to broaden our d customer base beyond the vision experts currently applying our d technology this significant launch brings cognex d products to a larger audience and sets the foundation for future easytouse d products and we expanded our id product portfolio with the dataman  series delivering our latest barcode reading algorithms in a compact package ideal for mounting in tight spaces the dataman  is the highest performance value line reader available supplementing our engineering efforts we continued our recent activity in ma closing two acquisitions in april first was vidi systems a swissbased startup specializing in deep learning software for industrial applications vidis proven technology significantly improves our machine vision capabilities for defect inspection which is increasingly important to our customers vidis tools are based on artificial intelligence in that they learn the rules for finding defects on the surfaces of discrete items such as cellphone cases by being shown examples of those defects vidi not only brings to cognex exciting technology that complements our industryleading vision algorithms it also adds to our team four highly skilled engineers with significant experience in applying deep learning to machine vision in april we also completed the acquisition of gvi ventures a small solutions provider for common automotive applications this acquisition helps increase our ability to serve some of our larger automotive customers with – automotive customers with a product that leverages the power of cognex visionpro with that as backdrop lets now turn to john for details of the first quarter john j curran  cognex corp thank you rob i have to say that i couldnt have possibly picked a better quarter for my first earnings call as cfo the company is setting new records and i should thank rob and the cognex team for making my job so easy this quarter without further ado lets get into the numbers our revenue of  million was  million above the top end of the range we gave to investors in february sales were better than expected across a range of industries including consumer electronics and automotive gross margin was strong at  representing an increase over last years q due to manufacturing efficiencies resulting from higher volume total operating expenses for q were  million an  increase yearoveryear we invested in engineering and our sales organization absorbed costs related to four acquisitions we closed in  and recorded higher commissions as a result of our revenue growth operating margin expanded to  from  a year ago this increase reflects the substantial leverage that incremental revenue has on our business model net income benefited from a  million discrete tax credit from the exercise of stock options during the quarter excluding all discrete tax items earnings were  per share which is  higher than the thomson reuters first call consensus estimate this excellent result was driven by our top line performance and excellent fall through to the bottom line looking at factory automation which is our largest market revenue grew by  yearonyear from an end market perspective growth was led by consumer electronics and automotive geographically all major regions increased over q a year ago asia was by far our fastestgrowing region with factory automation revenue doubling yearonyear our business in greater china and the rest of asia demonstrated exceptionally strong performance europe made a large contribution to our factory automation revenue growth increasing more than  yearonyear and finally in the americas factory automation revenue increased midteens yearonyear as the business improvement that began at the end of  continued in the first quarter now ill hand the microphone back to rob robert j willett  cognex corp thanks john in summary cognex had an exceptionally strong start to  in regard to specific guidance for q we believe that revenue will be between  million and  million this range represents midteen growth yearonyear despite less revenue from consumer electronics additional larger consumer electronics orders are expected to turn to revenue later in  unlike last year when large electronics orders were evenly split between q and q gross margin is expected to be in the mid to high  range somewhat lower than reported for q operating expenses are expected to increase by up to  from q as a result of our continued investments in engineering and sales the effective tax rate is expected to be  excluding discrete tax items now lets open the call up for your questions operator we are ready to take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from jagadish iyer from summit redstone your line is open jagadish k iyer  summit redstone partners llc yeah thanks for taking my question rob and dr bob and john so my first question is on large orders that you talked about on the consumer electronics is it just the timing or can you give some more color in terms of what kind of magnitude are we looking at compared to last year and then i have a followup please robert j willett  cognex corp sure hi jagadish welcome back to your coverage of cognex so i would say the underlying demand is very strong particularly in asia from consumer electronics devices that were seeing and it looks like our consumer electronics growth will be strong this year we dont discuss specific customers but we have a nice portfolio of large consumer electronics customers developing and we also have a good base business consisting of many customers who are supplying components and other items for electronic products weve seen a strong demand particularly from those component suppliers early in the year and we have a good visibility later in the year that gives us confidence that well see some good revenue growth from consumer electronics this year now just to reiterate large orders from consumer electronics are typically recognized as revenue in the middle of the year but unlike last year when revenue from large orders was more evenly split between q and q we expect large consumer electronics orders to turn to revenue in the second half of this year jagadish k iyer  summit redstone partners llc okay fair enough then as a followup on the topic of automotive weve been hearing some kind of a mixed bag in terms of things are starting to beat so i just was wondering what are your thoughts as we progress through the year in terms of how your exposure to autos are going to be changing any insight would be great thank you robert j willett  cognex corp yeah thanks so we see automotive as a large and important market for cognex it represents about a third of our business in terms of end user markets and overall we think of that business in the longterm as sort of a more steady grower maybe around our  growth rate over the long run but we have seen significantly higher growth rates in the last couple of quarters so weve certainly seen that its difficult to say how long that kind of higher growth rate in this case in the last quarter slightly more than  how much that kind of growth rate is sustainable over the long run we dont think it is but were certainly experiencing strong growth right now perhaps ill give you a little more detail if you look at automotive by region europe provided the largest contribution in absolute dollars asia automotive grew at the fastest rate led by china and our tier  automotive suppliers in the americas are spending at a higher rate than in recent years so those trends were seeing are often driven by electric vehicles for instance and supplying of electric components specifically into automotive were seeing those pretty widespread across all regions but i think rather like you by the sound of it we were surprised by quite how strong the demand was in the quarter that were just reporting jagadish k iyer  summit redstone partners llc thank you operator and our next question comes from paul coster from jpmorgan your line is open paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc yes just a little bit of color please on the consumer electronics space what is – how do you define a large customer what are the applications that these customers are taking is it uniform across the industry and is this starting to be a sort of trickle turning to a flood meaning theyre coming to you rather than you having to kind of evangelize at this point in the adoption cycle robert j willett  cognex corp yes hi paul so we sell those to component suppliers and to large brand owners in that space and id say we see a broadbased strengths across those customers historically over the last few years weve had one extremely large customer in the space but were now seeing other customers develop in that space that have the potential to be bringing tens of millions of dollars to our business on an annual basis so were seeing that were also seeing the adoption of new technologies as in other years where weve seen new technologies coming into smartphone design obviously theres a great deal of spend going on an investment going on in displays organic led displays and other displays certainly which is helping and where cognex can just add future value with the performance and precision and speed of applications like inspection and alignment of those materials so all of that looks good weve seen but more of that component level investment earlier in the year with signs of continued strength in the end user application more in the final assembly part later in the year im shaping up to make this another good growth year for cognex in consumer electronics paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and two other really quick questions first off the opex was up  and you said it was investment in engineering and sga and so on it was unrelated to the acquisition so this isnt just expenses kind of jumping up owing to taking on new staff from the acquired companys question john j curran  cognex corp yeah this is john yeah there was absolutely some increase in our operating spend due to the acquisitions we closed last year that was one of the elements of our growth in expenses from q to q so there was some impact to that paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc with seasonally stronger sequential growth in opex than we typically see is there any reason for that is it just that you view prospects in the second half justify john j curran  cognex corp its part of our investment cycle we are continuing to invest in sales and engineering resources our future prospects look good and were investing to support it robert j willett  cognex corp and this is rob i mean obviously when were growing the top line  were going to see extra sales commissions and expenses kind of coming in there extra around bonus kind of accruals so i think those are kind of normal things we expect plus were seeing – we have a lot of confidence in near term and longerterm capabilities giving us confidence doing that paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc got it and my last question is insight software platform you said its broadening the markets for you by some investments youve made there can you elaborate little bit so we can understand why its broadening adoptions robert j willett  cognex corp yes so weve had a very very successful product range known as insight which is at this point i believe about  years old and its much the most widely used environment in factory automation for programming vision systems and its very userfriendly and very wellunderstood and used its kind of the industry standard so were doing a number of things and investing in that to make it easier to use better design but also better functionality and what i mentioned earlier was were bringing that user interface from the d environment where its very strong into the world of d and traditionally d has been much more difficult to program but we launched a product which is a profiler so instead of a full d picture built up its a slice kind of crosssection of whats being looked at and then it uses the easybuilder insight environment to make it – to program and its very very easy to do so it kind of makes it much easier and its not only easier to implement its also a lot easier to sell so we expect the sales cycles and the capabilities of our sales team to be much enhanced with that easy user interface paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you very much operator and our next question comes from joe ritchie from goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co thanks good afternoon everyone robert j willett  cognex corp hey joe joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co so i guess my first question was there – in q clearly the growth rate was very strong i was just wondering was there any pull forward in demands into q and then maybe talk a little bit more about your confidence on the consumer electronics large project orders are those orders enhanced and whats causing that shift into a later portion of the year robert j willett  cognex corp yes so certainly there was some pull forward on our part i think probably our customers from what i can see felt more confident about investing so in less good economic environments we see customers deferring orders or delaying investment decisions were sort of seeing the opposite now where i think theyre moving to accelerate and they have more confidence about the outlook but certainly from our perspective no while we dont talk about backlog i would say that we exited q with a very very healthy backlog in relation to your consumer electronics question really our – the timing of revenue recognition depends on really whats going on in that market concerning when technology is being adopted and deployed and that has to do with when we recognize revenue and there is certain criteria we have to fulfill to – in all of our business actually to recognize revenue and that historically if we go back to  has meant weve recognized large pieces of consumer electronics revenue from large customers in different quarters in  q was the big quarter in  i believe q was and last year  it was evenly spread the big chunks broadly speaking between q and q this year were telling you second half of the year is when we expect that larger consumer electronics revenue to hit really has to do with whats going on with our customers and our own revenue recognition criteria joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co got it thats very helpful rob and i guess maybe one more followon question if we just kind of focus on q for a moment and you talked a little bit about the automotive end markets but would be helpful to have some additional color on the type of growth rates that you saw both in electronics and also in logistics as well robert j willett  cognex corp yes so in automotive we saw our stronger growth than weve seen historically on the order a little over  which is very strong electronics we saw our huge growth i dont think were going to talk about specific numbers and then we also saw a growth in logistics i think our logistics business looks like its – while it was decent in q the timing of revenue looks like its coming more in q so we do expect some strong logistics revenue flowing through in revenue that well recognize in the second quarter joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co perfect thank you very much operator and our next question comes from richard eastman from robert w baird your line is open richard eastman  robert w baird  co yes thank you rob dr bob john just to be clear rob can you tell us – or perhaps john could you just tell us if the large customer that you have identified in the past through the k filings was the revenue to that customer up or down in the first quarter yearoveryear robert j willett  cognex corp yeah rick we really cant give you specific information on that only really whats in the k which is annual in nature but we wouldnt be able to report you information on quarterly situations richard eastman  robert w baird  co is it directionally okay and then other asia exjapan exchina was up substantially can you just maybe flag the country that that came out of and maybe also the end market robert j willett  cognex corp yes so other asia is a region that includes korea actually japan as well india and asean which includes countries like thailand et cetera so though weve seen strong growth broadly across those regions but certainly the market thats really moved its results is korea and thats been very responsive as weve invested in it over the last two years we got a great sales team making big inroads in both consumer electronics and automotive in that market richard eastman  robert w baird  co okay and then maybe just for dr bob this bidding system could you just kind of speak to the opportunities set in this deep learning algorithms or software on the website you can see they kind of started in the factory automation market but im just curious as to what the opportunity set is there dr robert j shillman  cognex corp sure rick thanks for the question and its an important one up until now the vast majority of our bookings and revenue came from companies who had problems that we call the something somewhere problem in other words well let me back up and machine vision can be broken into – every machine vision problem can be broken into two types of problems theyre both difficult one is the something somewhere problem and the other is the anything anywhere problem our expertise from the founding of the company was in this something somewhere problem and an example of that is when a razor blade is made the customer the manufacturer wants to know if the edge of the blade is in the correct position our systems are trained by our engineers to know what an edge – what the cutting edge looks like and we train the system we write software when the customer configures a system to tell it where approximately that cutting edge should be then the camera captures the image and the software goes in finds the edge and measures the angle of the edge and the position of the edge very accurately and determines if its within spec or not so thats the something somewhere we know what it is we are supposed to be looking at its the cutting blade and we know approximately where its supposed to be something somewhere most machine vision problems until this time on discrete items items that you can pick up are the something somewhere problem in manufacturing are the buttons on the cellphone in the right place the system is trained to know what the buttons look like and where the buttons supposed to go but very recently – most recently in variety of factory automation applications in particular consumer electronics the manufacturers are very much concerned with the aesthetics of the product not just are all the parts in the right place and is the assembly correct and the screen correct and the screen brightness right but are there flaws or defects on the case either inside the case before the items are being put into the case because thats very important if there are flaws in the surfaces of the inside of the aluminum or plastic or whatever is the case they can make very big changes and the phone wont operate they could perhaps damage the battery if there are bumps some place so theyve come to us our customers have come to us many customers and asked for the ability to detect anything anywhere now anything anywhere means a scratch or a flaw if you look in the dictionary of the definition of flaw it can be anything its something that isnt supposed to be there in our cases the manufacturing its typically a surface defect on a discrete item such as the cellphone case or any kind of consumer item that – it could be a watch face and it could be a scratch or a defect extra paint or something thats not supposed to be there and until now we didnt have very good technology or tools for defining those defects to tell the computer what to look for so fortunately we found these very very smart guys in europe called vidi and there are many applications of deep learning and ai but most of them or the ones that we have the most of the ones weve seen have nothing to do with really machine vision they have to do with recognizing faces and photographs is this really my dog not your dog is this a cat and those are very interesting but they dont apply to factories vidi on the other hand we found specialized in the application of ai deep learning selflearning systems specifically to the kinds of things our customers want so in the way this operates is the customer it shows various examples of what they consider defects what they consider defects and the system then trains on these and by itself through this very very intensive software determines what it means is it a scratch of this length is it a whip all sorts of things that our engineers used to pull their hair out to actually write code for and now they dont have to the code exists in this deep learning system selflearning system to automatically look at this range of defects that the customers shown and by itself come up with the descriptions for what it is and then it uses those – thats called the training phase and then it uses those in the run mode of the system so once its been trained by the factory engineers – not by cognex were not going to be doing that we ship standard products as you know once the system has been trained by the manufacturer on what those defects are the system then is set to run mode and operates and we believe in our tests far better than any human could do and far better than our own engineers could previously do writing their own software so its – this is truly a breakthrough for us because it adds this kind of capability and it opens new opportunities for us where we previously couldnt go so now we have a full suite of tools i shouldnt say full suite were always expanding them we have tools that cover the something somewhere problem which weve been selling since  and now we will be able to offer the anything anywhere for discrete manufacturing items around the world does that answer your question its a long answer but its an educational one i used to be a professor so sorry for the longwinded response did you get it dr robert j shillman  cognex corp i dont know what happened robert j willett  cognex corp maybe rick get muted dr robert j shillman  cognex corp did you guys get it at least robert j willett  cognex corp we got it we loved it dr robert j shillman  cognex corp okay operator whats the next question operator and our next question comes from joe giordano from cowen your line is open joseph giordano  cowen  co llc hey guys thanks for the questions dr bob the rest of us did hear what you just said so thanks for that dr robert j shillman  cognex corp thank god thank you because its too hard i give this lecture and nobody answers right thank you joseph giordano  cowen  co llc just kind of related to that though is solving an anywhere anything – anything anywhere problem a higher revenue higher margin type of problem from a cognex perspective than your more traditional software packages dr robert j shillman  cognex corp well we havent yet decided on a price for it though it is very valuable it will be an addon i believe at some point to our insight product it will probably be a special software purchase and it is very valuable regarding the size of the market i cant tell you yet i dont think its as large of course as the something somewhere but its going to be growing and were going to look for more opportunities outside consumer electronics for using this joseph giordano  cowen  co llc great i also wanted to talk on d it seems like theres a lot more buzz around moving to d and i dont know if theres potentially more competition in that space now so i was just curious to see what your trends are specifically there whether youre seeing upselling your existing customers moving some applications from d to d and how you kind of view the competitive landscape today maybe versus when we talked at investor day or something like that or maybe over the last couple years dr robert j shillman  cognex corp so rob why dont you get that its a great – good question robert j willett  cognex corp yes yes yeah okay thank you joe so yes so d is an important space for cognex and one were investing heavily in both in our own engineering of products but also through acquisitions and like a lot of cognex business in the early days of business its slow and then it starts to really pick up were certainly seeing our d business grow substantially at the moment our d vision products grew nearly  in  but were still a small player in the  million market for d displacement sensors so and d is less than  of our overall business and will be this year as well weve made a recent acquisition the enshape and chiaro which brings us powerful data acquisition technology as called snapshot sensors that are complementary to our d displacement sensing products and we see a lot of growth potential in both those displacement sensing products but also snapshot sensing and we see the technology being applied broadly to many different applications as i mentioned early too our insight profiler brings that d technology to our d displacement products to a larger audience by making it much easier to program and sell so this is a major growth area for us one where we are expecting and seeing substantial growth and expect to continue that journey joseph giordano  cowen  co llc and if i could just sneak in one more you mentioned logistics maybe more of a q growth than q but thats been growing kind of in the   range on a fullyear basis for you is that something thats realistic this year or for the next few and then just maybe if you wanted to bring any comments out on the mx i know we spoke about it in the last couple quarters so robert j willett  cognex corp sure yeah so our journey into logistics is a few years underway at this point and its a market where we have the potential to grow at  per year for the foreseeable future and were confident about that currently in the current market were in and we expect strong sequential growth from logistics to come in q as we mentioned growth will come both from large orders and smaller and mediumsized logistics accounts we made meaningful progress in q to increase the number of our large customers in logistics certainly in that space and we see a number of our customers emerging who could represent many millions of dollars of revenue annually for cognex in the logistics space so revenue can be a little lumpy in that space there can be some larger orders that can hit in some quarters and not in others so although q was good it wasnt exceptional we expect q to be pretty significant and more exceptional i would say in terms of that – the logistics business now you asked also about the mx our breakthrough product for the mobile terminal market thats a product we launched last year and have been showing to customers in the market as i think of kind of when cognex enters a new space just like when we entered d or when we entered logistics it takes time to kind of win the confidence and understanding of customers so were still in the stage with that product where were showing it and demonstrating it and having early orders from customers who are evaluating the product we have had some significant wins that we told you about in the past but at this point were more evaluating the technology with customers and what were hearing is very encouraging and were hearing that from a broad base of customers who could be very significant in future so i think were still near the bottom at that sort of scurve of adoption but were very confident were going to be moving up that curve in the future joseph giordano  cowen  co llc thanks guys appreciate all the color operator and our next question comes from jim ricchiuti from needham  company your line is open jim ricchiuti  needham  company llc thank you good afternoon dr robert j shillman  cognex corp hey jim jim ricchiuti  needham  company llc rob i just wanted to follow up on the comments you made about the logistics market it sounds like youre seeing broader coverage in that market is there any way – and i realize you cant name customers but can you give us a sense if you look at the top   or so players in that market to what extent youre penetrating them robert j willett  cognex corp yeah i think were known to all i think the large logistics purchases particularly in the ecommerce space which is where really most of our growth and success is occurring at the moment were known to those players really in america and europe and were having good success of winning the majority of that business i would say and yeah in terms of numbers yes we have some very large customers both significant customers and others that we see developing into that kind of field where we can have – be doing millions of dollars per year i dont think i can really get specific about obviously customer names or specific dollar numbers for customers jim ricchiuti  needham  company llc understood does that opportunity extend into asia as well into some of the newer players there or is that more challenging robert j willett  cognex corp well i think as often with cognex were kind of learning and rolling out our technology in america and then we extend to europe were now making very significant inroads in china where clearly there would be many – or a number of very very significant ecommerce logistics purchases at machine vision technology theyre earlier in their adoption of technology and were wellknown to them and in evaluation but certainly in terms of bookings or revenue the china business is still relatively small in comparison to the success were seeing in americas and europe jim ricchiuti  needham  company llc okay and looking at the consumer electronics market youve talked on a number of occasions about seeing opportunities as it relates to the oled market were in a fairly significant investment cycle in that market that extends not just in korea but into other asian display makers outside of korea to what extent is this becoming a real meaningful driver for you in the consumer electronics market and is your competitive position as strong as it is in some other areas of the business robert j willett  cognex corp thanks its a good question yeah so display technology including organic leds is definitely seeing huge investment in automation billions of dollars in capex going into the production of those – that technology and those technologies in general so its major and were working both with end user companies that are manufacturing that technology which is then consumed by companies that actually sell the products we buy right and but also importantly with oems or machine builders who take vision technology and help the manufacturing process for that technology and sell into the big plants where its manufactured in a number of markets including korea vietnam and other markets china so were certainly seeing big big big pickup in that business i think its well understood by us our sales teams are wellknown and our application engineers and capabilities on the ground there are i would say with confidence the best in the world you asked a bit about kind of how competitive our actual technology is some of the applications that are required in that space are alignments so youre aligning very fragile and sensitive material to very high precision also inspection where youre looking at what is complex matrix of material that has to be integrated and looking for defects so both of those are things that we excel at as a company and so were very wellpositioned so i would say its certainly helping our growth and our reputation and the inroads were making into those major electronic suppliers and their machine builders jim ricchiuti  needham  company llc great thanks very much operator and our next question comes from bobby burleson from canaccord your line is open robert joseph burleson  canaccord genuity inc yeah good afternoon just going back to the mx i understand you guys are gearing up your sales force there for some – to sell more directly and im wondering kind of what the progress is so far are you seeing results from that and just tacking on to that just – youve got several customers that are at a kind of few hundred units each and theyre it sounds like going through some kind of evaluation phase before a more broad deployment wondering how long of an evaluation phase youre expecting and what a significant deployment would look like relative to the few hundred units that theyre at now thanks robert j willett  cognex corp yeah thanks bobby well building on my earlier comments mobile terminals is an exciting market where we expect to bring significant change were really introducing a different design concept which brings the power of cognex vision and the ease of use and power of a smartphone operating system to a market that hasnt really seen that before and its pretty entrenched with products really from two – the two big market leaders honeywell and what was the former symbol business motorola so what were seeing is that customers who see kind of the end of the road with the end of the microsoft industrial operating system which will no longer be supported after  and then also a lot of companies are using both those old industrial products and smartphones in their trucks and their supply chain and their warehouses so theyre seeing our technology which solves the problem for them and their – the response were seeing from many is very interested and very excited and wed like to evaluate it so one of the largest retailers in america met with us last week and was very very – bought large team to review the products and was very excited and is looking to implement it one of the largest trucking organizations in the country we met with their ceo recently about the potential deployment where theyre using two devices today would like to use one so were really seeing a lot of high potential funnel starting to build its too early to say when that funnel would turn into revenue i think at cognex were more we believe in sort of bringing high technology advantage solutions to a market and working kind of tirelessly until it gets adopted and youve seen us doing that in a number of markets logistics being a good example d being another were confident thats what were going to see in the mx market and were going to get it right so watch for discussions in future quarters im not quite sure which quarters were really going to see it take off robert joseph burleson  canaccord genuity inc okay great and then you mentioned bringing d to a larger audience im wondering that  million tam youve talked about theoretically how do you see that expanded by some of the progress youve made there robert j willett  cognex corp i dont see us resizing that  million market anytime soon not certainly in the next quarter or so were – but that market itself is growing so if we were to expand it it might be the fact that were seeing growth rate of about  and we probably gave you those numbers back in december of last year but what i will say is those applications within that market break down to between kind of complex applications where cognex is very strong and has large share and then simpler applications that use more of a profiler approach and those simpler applications are in fact the majority of the markets more than half of it right so were now in a position where we can compete in that space of the market much more competitively with the new product so im not increasing the size of the market weve given you that our ability to be competing in that space now with a much easier to use in program and much easier to sell product is certainly much greater robert joseph burleson  canaccord genuity inc okay and then consumer electronics larger orders are coming later this year than last year do you expect or do you have visibility i think to whether or not they would spill over into q robert j willett  cognex corp no its too soon to make the call between q and q robert joseph burleson  canaccord genuity inc okay great thanks operator and our next question comes from karen lau from deutsche bank your line is open karen k lau  deutsche bank securities inc thank you good afternoon maybe just followup on the question on display rob you talked about some of the applications in oled and display manufacturing just curious how would you compare the intensity of machine vision usage in display industry versus consumer electronics or smartphone assembly how – i guess however where you want to characterize it with that – with the opportunity displayed can it ever be as big as what the dollars that were seeing maybe from lets say your largest customer would it ever get there or is it going to be just a fraction of that robert j willett  cognex corp well i think ever is the key term there but what i would say is display technology is an area where were seeing a lot of investments right now i would say historically one tends to see kind of phases of investment that go on and where machine vision gets supplied so display is an example and i guess we saw our lcd displays a number of years back on tvs or whatever was also a kind of a growth area i think oled displays is something were going to see over a few years but final assembly and test of electronic devices is something were going to see over a much longer period so those final units have the potential to be very longterm substantial business while display technology it may be difficult to see out past the next couple of years about whether thats a market that will kind of mature or continue to grow in either respect though i would expect the kind of revenue cognex would see from final assembly and test of smartphones and mobile and wearable electronic devices is going to be bigger than what we see from screens and displays karen k lau  deutsche bank securities inc okay got it and then maybe just a couple of housekeeping in terms of the large order shifting to second half just curious digging – just want to dig a little bit deeper into this second quarter core growth rates if we were to parse out the comparison in large orders yearoveryear how much would the other underlying business be growing at in the second quarter dr robert j shillman  cognex corp be able to maybe break that out robert j willett  cognex corp yeah thats a difficult thing youre asking us to break out because i think well risk giving you information thats confidential what i would say is were going to see much lower large orders in q so you can really – you could take the midteens growth rate that we told you and figure thats really not much in terms of large consumer electronics orders hitting in the quarter which means the underlying growth rate is going to be well above our  factory automation growth rate that we expect well above that karen k lau  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats very helpful robert j willett  cognex corp and i was – yeah and i think karen k lau  deutsche bank securities inc yeah robert j willett  cognex corp if you go back to – you look at our performance in the last couple of quarters i think we were up  or so in q up  factory automation or  overall in q i think were gearing up still for strong underlying performance across broad industries in q and the anomaly is much more the large orders in consumer electronics profile thats causing that growth rate to flip back into the midteens that we are forecasting karen k lau  deutsche bank securities inc got it i understood and then just to confirm so when you look at second quarter and second half combined this year versus last year youre still expecting large orders to be up yearoveryear is that right robert j willett  cognex corp i think what we said is we expect consumer electronics to grow well this year and i think were not commenting on large orders and certainly not from any particular customer right i think the message id like you to take away is that we see strong growth in consumer electronics in our pipeline in q and for the year but not in q karen k lau  deutsche bank securities inc okay got it very helpful thank you operator and our next question comes from ben rose from battle road research your line is open ben z rose  battle road research ltd good evening gentlemen thank you for taking my call just a quick i guess followup question for rob in terms of what youre seeing on the automotive side particularly in asia and in europe are you seeing the use of the product primarily for existing manufacturing lines or is it for new lines as well assembly lines robert j willett  cognex corp hi ben thanks yeah so our automotive business performed well i think its wellknown really about the majority of our business in automotive is with tier  suppliers and an important but smaller part is with our brand owners or end user companies we see good growth in both parts of that and particularly tier  automotive suppliers who are looking to develop new components for new kinds of technologies particularly around electric vehicles were seeing significant spending by them and – but also by end users and then particularly in china its a market where were seeing very significant growth in our automotive business but its really broadbased as i said earlier across all of our regions ben z rose  battle road research ltd you had no particular difference between existing lines and new lines robert j willett  cognex corp no not that i would say i mean not a real change in the pattern over the last six months for sure i mean certainly we are seeing significant investment in new lines as weve said but were also seeing significant investment in components and investments in machine vision to support improved production on both existing and new lines ben z rose  battle road research ltd okay okay thanks very much operator and at this time im showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back to dr bob shillman for any closing remarks dr robert j shillman  cognex corp well thank you very much interesting questions thank you to wrap up it was an outstanding quarter a great start to the year and our outlook for q is also strong we are very excited not only – everybody can say were excited about the long term but we have enough data to say were also excited about the mid and even short term i want to thank all of you for joining us
