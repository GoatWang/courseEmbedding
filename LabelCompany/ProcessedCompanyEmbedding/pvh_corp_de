diffusion lines and the success of those brands are usually driven by highfashion and marketing high street usually trickles down into main street a few seasons behind below are the google trends analytics for calvin klein and tommy hilfiger respectively taking into account seasonality during holiday seasons there has been a steady uptick in interest over time especially the last few months source google  guidance by the company is conservative if you believe that calvin klein will have a brand revival “with the appointment of raf simons calvin klein began a momentous new chapter in the brand’s history as we continue to evolve this new direction will further strengthen our premium positioning worldwide and pave the way for longterm global growth  steven b shiffman chief executive ofﬁcer calvin klein the above statement by calvin klein ceo is fairly bullish but doesnt seem reflected in the company guidance pvh guidance does not account for a brand revival but rather a conservative growth rate based on the current order book and organic growth at bn  growth of revenue and  eps for the fiscal year wall street consensus is at bn of revenue and  eps as with most consumer companies the biggest driver of growth is the brand itself the best example of a brand revival i can think of is adidas with the relaunch of the stan smith sneakers and now superstar sneakers below is a fiveyear stock price chart plotted against earnings and revenue chart for adidas can you guess when the stan smiths were relaunched adidas relaunched the stan smith mid as seen in the revenue bar chart a year after the revenue bump adidas beat earnings for consecutive quarters wall street tends to gets fashion wrong because it cannot predict a change in trends source sentieo  europe is a powerhouse in the making in european cities like amsterdam and paris calvin klein and tommy hilfiger sadly also abercrombie  fitch nyseanf are premium brands it is probably because europe doesnt have macys and europeans have never seen these clothing trampled on the floor at  off sale with an additional  off calvin klein and tommy hilfiger are sold in premium department stores such as printemps and galeries lafayette in addition to over  retail stores pvh enjoys higher margins in europe as a premium brand as well as higher retailwholesale mix  retail in europe vs  retail in the us below are top regions on the google search for calvin klein and tommy hilfiger respectively europe tops on interests for the two brands source google who is jeff macke and why is he long jeff macke is a master chartist and the father figure america deserves his father was the first ceo of target and has grown up around consumer retail jeff is a great thinker and expert in all things retail i think jeffs long thesis is that pvh will go through margin expansion and increased sales as they focus on directtoconsumer on their website instead of selling at macys with the acquisition of true  co it does seem that pvh realizes that directtoconsumer is the future of retail what he is arguing for makes sense but ultimately the turnaround of the image of a brand drives sales and profitability more than operational or business model improvements so what should i do i dont know what you should do but i know what i would do i really do believe that the stars are aligned for pvh will have some outstanding quarters to come due to a brand resurgence options are pretty expensive at the moment so im looking to pick up stock beyond earnings there is no shortterm catalyst for a brand revival id look to buy along the day moving average as it seems to want to return back to the trend line id look for a longterm play and just ride it until the momentum changes what is the bear case on pvh as with anything else please do your own due diligence pvh is prone to miss earnings like any other company although its earnings are in my opinion conservative pvh is subject to selloffs as the broader retail sector has been very challenged relative valuations are reasonable given the growth rates but the industry can see multiple contraction disclosure i amwe are long pvh i wrote this article

account seasonality during holiday seasons there has been a steady uptick in interest over time especially the last few months source google  guidance by the company is conservative if you believe that calvin klein will have a brand revival “with the appointment of raf simons calvin klein began a momentous new chapter in the brand’s history as we continue to evolve this new direction will further strengthen our premium positioning worldwide and pave the way for longterm global growth  steven b shiffman chief executive ofﬁcer calvin klein the above statement by calvin klein ceo is fairly bullish but doesnt seem reflected in the company guidance pvh guidance does not account for a brand revival but rather a conservative growth rate based on the current order book and organic growth at bn  growth of revenue and  eps for the fiscal year wall street consensus is at bn of revenue and  eps as with most consumer companies the biggest driver of growth is the brand itself the best example of a brand revival i can think of is adidas with the relaunch of the stan smith sneakers and now superstar sneakers below is a fiveyear stock price chart plotted against earnings and revenue chart for adidas can you guess when the stan smiths were relaunched adidas relaunched the stan smith mid as seen in the revenue bar chart a year after the revenue bump adidas beat earnings for consecutive quarters wall street tends to gets fashion wrong because it cannot predict a change in trends source sentieo  europe is a powerhouse in the making in european cities like amsterdam and paris calvin klein and tommy hilfiger sadly also abercrombie  fitch nyseanf are premium brands it is probably because europe doesnt have macys and europeans have never seen these clothing trampled on the floor at  off sale with an additional  off calvin klein and tommy hilfiger are sold in premium department stores such as printemps and galeries lafayette in addition to over  retail stores pvh enjoys higher margins in europe as a premium brand as well as higher retailwholesale mix  retail in europe vs  retail in the us below are top regions on the google search for calvin klein and tommy hilfiger respectively europe tops on interests for the two brands source google who is jeff macke and why is he long jeff macke is a master chartist and the father figure america deserves his father was the first ceo of target and has grown up around consumer retail jeff is a great thinker and expert in all things retail i think jeffs long thesis is that pvh will go through margin expansion and increased sales as they focus on directtoconsumer on their website instead of selling at macys with the acquisition of true  co it does seem that pvh realizes that directtoconsumer is the future of retail what he is arguing for makes sense but ultimately the turnaround of the image of a brand drives sales and profitability more than operational or business model improvements so what should i do i dont know what you should do but i know what i would do i really do believe that the stars are aligned for pvh will have some outstanding quarters to come due to a brand resurgence options are pretty expensive at the moment so im looking to pick up stock beyond earnings there is no shortterm catalyst for a brand revival id look to buy along the day moving average as it seems to want to return back to the trend line id look for a longterm play and just ride it until the momentum changes what is the bear case on pvh as with anything else please do your own due diligence pvh is prone to miss earnings like any other company although its earnings are in my opinion conservative pvh is subject to selloffs as the broader retail sector has been very challenged relative valuations are reasonable given the growth rates but the industry can see multiple contraction disclosure i amwe are long pvh i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving

from a weaker euro the revenues in the tommy hilfiger north america segment decreased  due to a  drop in retail comparable store sales primarily as a result of the decline in traffic and consumer spending trends in us stores located in international tourist locations due to the stronger dollar tommy hilfiger international segment revenues decreased by  including a  negative foreign currency impact pfhs net income net income increased by  in fiscal  mainly due to higher net revenues and a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses related to lower retirement plan expense
