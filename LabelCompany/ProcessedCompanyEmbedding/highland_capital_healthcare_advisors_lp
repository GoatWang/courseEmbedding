draw for experienced wholesalers” said brad ross president of highland funds “the opportunity to represent this broad range of products has been a key factor in attracting top talent and growing our ibd sales team” among that top talent is pj mcdaniel managing director and head of ibd sales who joined highland in october  and has served as a catalyst for the firm’s growth in this area his
