countries increased an estimated  overall at constant rates in the first six months of  our tv advertising revenues increased  at actual rates and  at constant rates in the first half of  which reflected significant growth of demand in romania as well as higher levels of spending in the czech republic and slovenia carriage fees and subscription revenues increased  at actual rates and  at constant rates in the first half of  due to additional carriage fees generated in slovakia and slovenia following our exit from dtt as well as growth in subscribers in other markets costs charged in arriving at oibda were broadly flat at actual rates and increased  and  at constant rates in the three and six months ended june   as targeted investments in our programming lineup and higher bad debt charges were mostly offset by savings from transmission costs oibda increased  at actual rates and  at constant rates in the first half of  resulting in oibda margin expansion of  basis points to  from  in the same period in  the increase in oibda improved operating income  at actual rates and  at constant rates in the first half of  unlevered free cash flow for the six months ended june   increased  reflecting higher cash collections and net cash generated by continuing operating activities also included lower cash payments for interest and guarantee fees on july   we agreed to sell our operations in croatia and slovenia and plan to use proceeds of the sale which is expected to close by yearend to repay our  term loan this will significantly accelerate our plans to deleverage and reduce our current borrowing cost by  basis points to  resulting in savings of more than us  million in annual interest costs in addition to us  million of savings from the march repricing transaction michael del nin cochief executive officer commented the first half of the year has been marked by important transactions and impressive financial performance the combination of which positions us for a significant reduction in our leverage over the next  months following a successful sale of our operations in croatia and slovenia we will have brought forward our deleveraging plans by a year and will be in a position to take full advantage of the automatic reductions in our borrowing costs as a result once we have achieved this we should be able to pivot from our intense focus on debt reduction by   while this will increase the options we have for capital allocation our decisions will as always be driven by our determination to create shareholder value christoph mainusch cochief executive officer added the successful spring season contributed to prime time audience share increasing in five countries in the first half of  while operating margins improved as additional investments in content were mostly offset by other savings these investments in programming in highly competitive markets also support our initiatives to diversify revenues and carriage fees and subscription revenue grew significantly in the first half of the year  we still expect carriage fees and subscription revenue from our four remaining operations going forward to increase double digits

period revenues and costs number is not meaningful nongaap financial measures in this release we refer to several nongaap financial measures including oibda oibda margin free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow we believe that each of these metrics is useful to investors for the reasons outlined below nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies nongaap financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with and are not a substitute for us gaap financial measures we evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and oibda we believe oibda is useful to investors because it provides a meaningful representation of our performance as it excludes certain items that do not impact either our cash flows or the operating results of our operations oibda and unlevered free cash flow are also used as components in determining management bonuses oibda includes amortization and impairment of program rights and is calculated as operating income  loss before depreciation amortization of intangible assets and impairments of assets and certain unusual or infrequent items that are not considered by our cochief executive officers when evaluating our performance stockbased compensation and certain other items are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance and therefore are not included in their respective oibda our key performance measure of the efficiency of our consolidated operations and our segments is oibda margin we define oibda margin as the ratio of oibda to net revenues following a refinancing transaction in march  the amount of interest and related guarantee fees on our outstanding indebtedness that must be paid in cash has increased in addition to this obligation to pay more interest and related guarantee fees in cash we expect to use cash generated by the business to pay certain guarantee fees that are payable in kind these cash payments are all reflected in free cash flow accordingly we believe unlevered free cash flow defined as free cash flow before cash payments for interest and guarantee fees best illustrates the cash generated by our operations when comparing periods we define free cash flow as net cash generated from continuing operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment net of disposals of property plant and equipment and excluding the cash impact of certain unusual or infrequent items that are not included in costs charged in arriving at oibda because they are not considered by our cochief executive officers when evaluating performance for additional information regarding our business segments see item  note  segment data in our form q while our reporting currency is the dollar our consolidated revenues and costs are divided across a range of european currencies and cme ltds function currency is the euro given the significant movement of the

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
