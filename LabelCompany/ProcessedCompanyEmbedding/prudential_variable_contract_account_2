prudential insurance company of america �prudential� under the laws of the state of new jersey and is registered as an openend diversified management investment company under the investment company act of  as amended vca has been designed for use by public school systems and certain taxexempt organizations to provide for the purchase and payment of taxdeferred variable annuities the investment objective of the account is longterm growth of capital its investments are composed primarily of common stocks although variable annuity payments differ according to the investment performance of the account they are not affected by mortality or expense experience because prudential assumes the expense risk and the mortality risk under the contracts � note� � summary of significant accounting policies � securities valuation����securities listed on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on such exchange on the day of valuation or if there was no sale on such day at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices or at the last bid price on such day in the absence of an asked price securities traded via nasdaq are valued at the official closing price provided by nasdaq securities that are actively traded in the overthecounter market including listed securities for which the primary market is believed by prudential investments llc �pi� or �manager� in consultation with the subadvisers to be overthecounter are valued by an independent pricing agent or principal market maker options on securities and indices traded on an exchange are valued at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and asked prices on such exchange futures contracts and options thereon traded on a commodities exchange or board of trade are valued at the last sale price at the close of trading on such exchange or board of trade or if there was no sale on the applicable commodities exchange or board of trade on such day at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and asked prices on such exchange or board of trade or at the last bid price in the absence of an asked price any security for which a reliable market quotation is unavailable is valued at fair value by a valuation committee appointed by the account�s committee members � investments in mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of the new york stock exchange on the date of the valuation � shortterm investments which mature in more than  days are valued based on current market quotations shortterm investments having maturities of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value amortized cost is computed using the cost on the date of purchase adjusted for constant accretion of discount or amortization of premium to maturity � securities transactions and investment income����securities transactions are recorded on the trade date realized gains losses on sales of securities are calculated on the identified cost basis dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date and interest income including amortization of premiums and accretion of discount on debt securities as required is recorded on the accrual basis income and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated to the participants and prudential on a daily basis in proportion to their respective ownership in vca expenses are recorded on the accrual basis which may require the use of certain estimates by management � options����the account may either purchase or write options in order to hedge against adverse market movements or fluctuations in value caused by changes in prevailing interest rates with respect to securities which the fund currently owns or intends to purchase the account�s principal reason for writing options is to realize through receipt of premiums a greater current return than would be realized on the underlying security alone when the account purchases an option it pays a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as an asset when the account writes an option it receives a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as a liability the asset or liability is adjusted daily to reflect the current market value of the option � if an option expires unexercised the account realizes a gain or loss to the extent of the premium received or paid if an option is exercised the premium received or paid is an adjustment to the proceeds from the sale or the cost of the purchase in determining whether the account has realized a gain or loss the difference � between the premium and the amount received or paid on effecting a closing purchase or sale transaction is also treated as a realized gain or loss gain or loss on purchased options is included in net realized gain or loss on investment transactions gain or loss on written options is presented separately as net realized gain or loss on written options � the account as writer of an option may have no control over whether the underlying securities may be sold called or purchased put as a result the account bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option the account as purchaser of an option bears the risk of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts � written options involve elements of both market and credit risk in excess of the amounts reflected in the statements of assets and liabilities � federal income taxes����the operations of vca are part of and are taxed with the operations of prudential under the current provisions of the internal revenue code prudential does not expect to incur federal income taxes on earnings of vca to the extent the earnings are credited under the contracts as a result the unit value of vca has not been reduced by federal income taxes � annuity reserves����reserves are computed for purchased annuities using the prudential  group annuity valuation gav table adjusted and a valuation interest rate

organizations to provide for the purchase and payment of taxdeferred variable annuities the investment objective of the account is longterm growth of capital its investments are composed primarily of common stocks although variable annuity payments differ according to the investment performance of the account they are not affected by mortality or expense experience because pica assumes the expense risk and the mortality risk under the contracts   note    accounting policies the account follows investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification topic  financial servicesinvestment companies the following accounting policies conform to us generally accepted accounting principles the account consistently follows such policies in the preparation of its financial statements security valuation    the account holds securities and other assets that are fair valued at the close of each day the new york stock exchange nyse is open for trading fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the accounts committee members the committee has adopted valuation procedures for security valuation under which fair valuation responsibilities have been delegated to prudential investments llc pi or manager under the current valuation procedures the established valuation committee is responsible for supervising the valuation of portfolio securities and other assets the valuation procedures permit the account to utilize independent pricing vendor services quotations from market makers and alternative valuation methods when market quotations are either not readily available or not deemed representative of fair value a record of the valuation committees actions is subject to the committees review approval and ratification at its next regularlyscheduled quarterly meeting various inputs determine how the accounts investments are valued all of which are categorized according to the three broad levels level   or  detailed in the table following the accounts schedule of investments common and preferred stocks exchangetraded funds and derivative instruments such as futures or options that are traded on a national securities exchange are valued at the last sale price as of the close of trading on the applicable exchange where the security principally trades securities traded via nasdaq are valued at the nasdaq official closing price to the extent these securities are valued at the last sale price or nasdaq official closing price they are classified as level  in the fair value hierarchy in the event that no sale or official closing price on valuation date exists these securities are generally valued at the mean between the last reported bid and asked prices or at the last bid price in the absence of an ask price these securities are classified as level  in the fair value hierarchy as the inputs are observable common and preferred stocks traded on foreign securities exchanges are valued using pricing vendor services that provide model prices derived using adjustment factors based on information such as local closing price relevant general and sector indices currency fluctuations depositary receipts and futures as applicable securities valued using such model prices are classified as level  in the fair value hierarchy as the adjustment factors are observable such securities are valued using model prices to the extent that the valuation meets the established confidence level for each security if the confidence level is not met or the vendor does not provide a model price securities are valued in accordance with exchangetraded common and preferred stocks discussed above investments in openend nonexchangetraded mutual funds are valued at their net asset values as of the close of the nyse on the date of valuation these securities are classified as level  in the fair value hierarchy since they may be purchased or sold at their net asset values on the date of valuation   c fixed income securities traded in the overthecounter otc market are generally valued at prices provided by approved independent pricing vendors the pricing vendors provide these prices after evaluating observable inputs including but not limited to yield curves yield spreads credit ratings deal terms tranche level attributes default rates cash flows prepayment speeds brokerdealer quotations and reported trades securities valued using such vendor prices are classified as level  in the fair value hierarchy otc derivative instruments are generally valued using pricing vendor services which derive the valuation based on inputs such as underlying asset prices indices spreads interest rates and exchange rates these instruments are categorized as level  in the fair value hierarchy account securities and other assets that cannot be priced according to the methods described above are valued based on pricing methodologies approved by the committee in the event that unobservable inputs are used when determining such valuations the securities will be classified as level  in the fair value hierarchy when determining the fair value of securities some of the factors influencing the valuation include the nature of any restrictions on disposition of the securities assessment of the general liquidity of the securities the issuers financial condition and the markets in which it does business the cost of the investment the size of the holding and the capitalization of the issuer the prices of any recent transactions or bidsoffers for such securities or any comparable securities any available analyst media or other reports or information deemed reliable by the investment adviser regarding the issuer or the markets or industry in which it operates using fair value to price securities may result in a value that is different from a securitys most recent closing price and from the price used by other mutual funds to calculate their net asset values rights    the account may hold rights acquired either through a direct purchase including as part of private placement or pursuant to corporate actions rights entitle the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common stock at a specific price and time through the expiration dates such rights are held as long positions by the account until exercised sold or expired rights are valued at fair value in accordance with the committee members approved fair valuation procedures restricted and illiquid securities    the account may hold up to  of its net assets in illiquid securities including those that are restricted as to
