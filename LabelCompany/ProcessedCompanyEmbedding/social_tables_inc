what it means to be a tabler we had this event last year at studio theater and we went to vegas lounge afterwards to celebratethe daybreaker this was a am rave held in our office the day of our day long education event i didnt think it was possible to bring a dj in black out the windows and cover the room in glow sticks but we did and it was a completely new experience for me dj pelonkey was incredible and seeing other tablers break out in amazing dance moves was very unexpected and very entertaining it was a great way to kick off a full day of learningour series b closing dinner we had to set our own tables at the watergate i loved it we walked into a room with rounds that needed to be set with linens china and chairs we were assigned tables and we competed to see who could get it done first once again this is an experience i would never have if i didnt work at social tables we got to see first hand how our software helps event crews set up and break down eventsthese three stick out for me ive been with the company for  years and i am happy i made the choice to come heregrowthive grown so much since i started ive challenged myself in terms of what i am capable of and

customers like customers are treated pretty well and seem happy with support  there is a risk that the product becomes commoditized over time due to competitive threats from other offerings thoughlots of smart and energetic people on the team and a highenergy environmentconsthe executive team in particular the ceo lacks real business experience and tends to rely on trendy business article themes as ways to drive their strategythinking most of the execs that actually had any successful tech business background have since left largely due to frustration or inability to work constructively with the ceo leaving a current leadership in place that really is generally quite inexperienced at leading a tech company there is a lack of ability or willingness to develop a plan and execute it without jerking it and the team around before allowing it to have any chance of being successful while this type of change is touted as a positive it is actually counterproductive to the team and the business a little bit a longerterm view is needed and less hyperreaction based on immediate results and emotionthe ceo is the core of the problems at st as he is so focused on crafting his personal image driven by a desire to be viewed as a visionary in the techstartup arena while lacking real leadership qualities or practical experience to apply as the ceo of a company at this stage he relies too much on his close longterm allies that feed his ego and support his erratic behavior to the detriment of the company while an earlierstage startup may survive that st is now beyond that point and needs real leadership at the helmadvice to managementfocus more on better blocking and tackling less about the personal image of the ceoperception of the company to the outside world less about the

possibilities of where the software might get to one day please note i have tried to reach a mutually amicable solution with social tables prior to posting this review what do you disliked rednedring glitchy on events with more than  tables otherwise i wasna big fan and loyal user unfortunately pricing plan is all over the shop customer journey for my whole experience over two years seemed disjointed i feel that the staff have recently lost sight of the fact real people with real business use their software some may say i got a result but i subscribed for some time to a  per month deal initially to try the software little did i know that the set up was wrong and it gave me most of the functionality during this time only to be told i would get a  price rise for the same functionality  would only now give me room diagramming which is no use on its own as a small business i would understand a small increase but surely fully loaded package with the price going up per user would make more sence i would never have started using this software at  per month equally the team seems unempowered to make businessrecommendations to others considering the productconsider other options

always had to shift things around the day of and most of the time the rooms were very cramped and looked off balance its so great that this also gives you comfy room between tables to people can walk through easily this program takes the guesswork out of event diagramming at our incredibly busy wedding venue it is a life saver and the guest management tool is the best brides dont have to mess with options on theknotcom which arent to scale im so thrilled we have this its very user friendly as wellwhat do you dislikesometimes the guest list gets attached to something else and im still learning when it comes to the menus tab im not sure if the directions go over that but i hope it does i need to send myself a link and try it out myself so i know exactly what the client is looking at when the lists dont come in right at least they have a great support team to helprecommendations to others considering the productit is worth every penny self drawn diagrams not to scale your just asking for an event to blow up in your face every venue in the industry and ever hotel should invest in this software i would suggest though sending yourself a link and creating a dummy event when training employees on how to use it so you can see exactly what your client sees and put yourself in their shoeswhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedwe are solving the issue of diagramming plated meals vegetarians food allergies and guest lists this solves the problem of having diagrams not to scale and saves us countless hours of labor having to adjust room set ups at the last minute it also streamlines the process for our clients with assigned seating plated meals kids meals allergies high chairs wheelchairs booster seats gluten free etc it makes us look incredibly prepared in the eyes of our guests because we know exactly who needs special assistance or a special mealread moreshare on of  found this helpfulhelpfulyesno commentsadd a

glitches in software cause massive problems at eventsupdated on june  validated reviewverified current userwhat do you like bestwe first began using social tables in  it was an incredibly useful tool for our clients however about  months ago the platform began to continually crash with glitches causing major irreversible errors for our clients and their vip guests during events through my discussions with social tables i came to learn that they knew about all of the glitches in their product and failed to warn their paid users about the potential problems what do you dislikei have spent an inordinate amount of hours on the phone email and chat with social tables support many of their support agents were less knowledgeable about their product than i was it took weeks to get calls returned to upper management when i relayed my clients issues and the fact that our contracts were threatened because of social tables massive failures in their product again that they knew about their upper management failed at fulfilling my clients requests for an explanation their only effort was requesting that i participate in the testing of a new product over the course of months i learned that social tables is not only a failed software platform but that social tables knows that their software does not work as promised and yet they feel that they have no duty to their customers to avail them of their products failures furthermore i learned that social tables customer support customer care and upper management know very little about business i gotwhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizednothing is solved when using social tables in fact more problems are createdread moreshare on of  found this helpfulhelpfulyesnoresponse

sqft of bookable space participants impacted events plannedwhen was the last time you smiled at an event whether it was because of a story a conference speaker shared or because someone you love received an award or because you connected with a colleague who lives in another state that moment impacted you forever it may have changed your outlook on that day it may have caused you to think differently and probably impacted your future and the future of those around yougreat things such as accelerating social entrepreneurship around the world “i want to send a tremendous thank you to you and your team for your help at the global good fund gala we literally could not have done registration without you that evening and you all helped to make it seamless you all were fabulous and a huge help”  kristen y archer bravo great things such as supporting sports fans as they scream their heads off for touchdowns and feel more alive than ever before “it’s really important to us that the fan experience is great right from the start and that it isn’t kicked off on a negative tone when fans have to wait  minutes just to be checkedin”  ilsa marden the baltimore ravensgreat things such as
