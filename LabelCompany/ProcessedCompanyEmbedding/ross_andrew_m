behind ross andrew winery who we are ross andrew mickel winemaker a seattlearea native ross’ path to wine production began on a  flyfishing trip with canlis restaurant heir mark canlis  it was during this afternoon on the river where mark asked ross if he had any interest in learning about wine from the restaurant perspective – and he jumped at the opportunity to learn from the best in the northwest there are few if any restaurants that can match the history class service and knowledge about fine dining and wine like the team at canlis  so while working under canlis master sommelier rob bigelow ross soon realized that wine was going to be his life’s journey  and it was from here that he launched into traveling the globe australia south america europe and south africa to learn all he could about food and wine  upon returning home and realizing it was time to get something going he landed a harvest job as cellar rat at washington state icon winery delille cellars which was immediately followed by a vintage at one of australia’s leading wineries rosemount estate  returning to the us ross was hired at arguably one of washington’s most highly allocated and respected producers betz family winery where he spent nearly a decade helping craft some of washington state’s most sought after wines under master of wine one of  on this globe we call earth bob betz it was under the guidance and support of bob and cathy betz that ross and his family started ross andrew winery in   three barrels became fifteen then thirty and now nearly  barrels of red wine rest peacefully in our cellar each vintage  along the way the winery has developed relationships with the state’s most reputable and attentive growers from which our wines are crafted  ross has also been hired to exact the skills he honed at betz family and ross andrew winery as winemaker for grand reveforce majeure winery where he’s earned scores of  and  points more than once from the wine industry’s leading periodicals  included is a  point accolade from wine spectator for a red mountain cabernet sauvignon the highest rating ever given to a washington state cabernet sauvignon alexandra j mickel line item veto queen …or dr no  whatever title you choose to give her she’s in charge  alexandra has a keen eye and ability to keep us headed in the right direction while entertaining our tangents and wild plans with a tight leash  sheila nelson executive culinary director sheila has been the chef behind all our events since our opening with the  harvest her ability to craft both simple and masterful meals is second to none  we consider her the macgyver of the cooking world ned nelson chief design officer and encyclopedia ned has been a commercial and residential architect for nearly  years in addition to that he knows  out of  things which is rather impressive  at ross andrew winery he is in charge of our flow controls and process design his mechanical encryption skills are the driving force behind designing the only domestically manufactured commercialgrade basket press in the us visit carlsenassociatescom galena mickel svp sales and legal galena our bernese mountain dog has ben svp of sales and legal since joining the ross andrew team back in q of   while her lack of opposable thumbs keeps her from using a cork screw or driving the delivery van she can reach the pedals but then steering and vision are out of the question she does have a remarkable ability to do what she wants when she wants thats the legal galenas law  whether she greets you with a

ross andrew winery  woodinville wa philosophy winemaking philosophy current release past releases vineyard sources where to find our wines short version don’t mess up what the vineyards give us and keep the process interesting and lively slightly longer version too many people try to make wine into much more than it is and it ends up coming across as an intimidating and elitist pursuit   our goal is to go in the other direction  keep it simple and make it fun at the end of the day we’re talking about squished grapes  but it’s the process the grapes follow from vineyard to bottle that is most important  to start we are blessed to have partnerships with the greatest growers in washington state’s columbia valley and columbia gorge avas  it’s these relationships that give us the best possible cabernet sauvignon syrah petit verdot and pinot gris  we’re also learning how incredible oregon’s willamette valley is for our pinot blanc dominant blend meadow in the winery we treat the grapes with the attention and respect they deserve the minute they arrive  once the wines successfully complete fermentation we make it our top priority to know what is happening in each and every barrel  this allows us to craft world class singularly distinctive consistent wines for you to enjoy bottom line we’re having a great time making delicious wines   ross andrew winery all rights

  new releases from washington state by stephen tanzer novdec  if this year’s coverage of new releases from washington state is longer than ever before that’s because there are more wines worthy of your notice than previously sure i’m still depressed by the number of oxidized hollow or otherwise flawed wines i taste on my annual visit to washington state and amazed that the offending wineries can find homes for these bottles but today’s stiff competition to sell wine in a difficult economic environment in conjunction with new plantings of the right varieties in the right sites the steady maturation of existing vines and more careful winemaking and élevage have enabled previous underperformers to make solid wines and allowed washington’s stars to take their wines to a yet higher level of quality like so many winemakers in california growers in washington once harvested strictly on brix levels whether the grapes had achieved phenolic ripeness or not then they got the idea that they needed to pick their grapes with fully brown seeds in order to make great wine and now they’re coming around to thinking that the ideal time to harvest lies somewhere between these two extremes the result is fresher better balanced wines that are more likely to enjoy a positive evolution in bottle it helps too that washington has enjoyed a favorable recent string of vintages many of the new reds i tasted in recent months are from  a vintage most producers are thrilled with this reasonably warm and even growing season which avoided serious heat spikes yielded dense complex elegant wines with vibrancy including many very good whites some producers say their s combine the structure and ripeness of the s with the verve of the s and that the vintage looks to be one of the great ones for washington although the best ’s i tasted in recent months have the stuffing and balance to be agers they are often so deep juicy and attractively fruity now that it’s hard to defer gratification many of these wines seem even fresher than the s and in fact numerous growers reported that these wines have lower phs and more energy than the previous vintage the first half of the  growing season was cooler than usual and the flowering budbreak and veraison were up to two weeks later than the norm but then a very warm august and favorable september weather helped to bring the fruit to nearperfect ripeness and although the harvest took place from several days to two or three weeks later than that of  the state’s major viticultural areas were lucky enough not to be hit by early frost or fall rains as the later pickers were in  my early look at the reds suggests that the vintage’s better examples are characterized by very good color solid backbone and enticing floral aromatics not surprisingly  appears to be a very good vintage for white wines too in many cases alcohol levels for reds as well as whites are lower than in recent vintages as always the trickiest category of wines both for me to score and for consumers to buy are those that rate in the  to  point range ie very good but not outstanding this range includes wellmade nicely balanced and rather refined wines that simply lack the concentration depth and complexity to merit point ratings that’s no knock on their quality in many cases talented winemakers have done a wonderful job with fruit from very young vines but this scoring range also includes many other very ripe overextracted and chunky wines that must be recognized for their sweetness and strength of material but that come off as a bit heavyhanded and unrefined some of these wines get much higher scores in other publications but i don’t find enough flavor complexity definition or textural appeal to get overly excited about them and i doubt that most readers of this publication will either varieties in and out of favor a sick joke going around washington state is not a bit funny to many growers question “what’s the difference between syrah and syphilis” answer “at least you can get rid of a case of syphilis” i should note that many of california’s producers saw their syrahs dead in the marketplace even before the infection spread to washington it remains to be seen what will happen to the newest plantings of syrah especially those that are not in the best sites there are already instances of producers blending syrah with cabernet and this trend may continue the fact that syrah is a tough sell whether in washington or california is a real shame as there are more superb examples now being produced in both areas than ever before and in washington state a good percentage of them are done in a northern rhône style that should offer considerable appeal for francophiles the best syrahs i tasted in recent months were among the most exciting wines of my tastings this year i saw a few new malbec bottlings of interest but as these wines are not generally in the under range they don’t yet represent much of a threat to bottlings from argentina the number of grenache bottlings is also on the rise and some of these are quite intriguing meanwhile the number of really good varietally labeled merlots continues to contract today they can be counted on the fingers of two hands a couple that come to mind are examples from abeja and woodward canyon bordeaux blends are becoming more and more interesting with clever winemakers making increasing use of grapes like cabernet franc and petit verdot planted in the right sites and crafting more complex and complete wines in the process all of the following wines were tasted in washington and in new york in the past four months reviews from robert parkers wine advocate julyaugust  august    columbia valley cabernet sauvignon           points the  cabernet sauvignon contains

stephen tanzer novdec  at a time when some of washington’s most thoughtful winemakers are considering how they might make ripe satisfying wines at lower alcohol levels recent vintages have brought a return to more normal conditions following the  trio of very warm years in my extensive tastings of washington wines in seattle and in walla walla valley at the end of july and in recent weeks back in new york i sampled  reds from most of the state’s best producers and i’m happy to report that this was a year that benefited from a more leisurely ripening process there was a single heat spike in august but the weather cooled off at harvest time and growers could generally pick at their leisure often well into october the wines show fresher natural acidity than the s and in many cases more complexity with healthier phs these wines are likely to enjoy a slow and leisurely development in bottle two thousand seven is also quite different in character from recent hot years like  and  and i was particularly impressed by the freshness of the white wines i tasted—not just viogniers but rieslings sauvignonsemillon blends and even chardonnays early evidence is that  is an exceptional vintage for washington’s white wines but with no burst of heat at the end it was a challenge to get the cabernet fruit fully ripe in some sites especially where crop loads were too heavy today many washington growers are harvesting smarter they’re picking on flavor profile rather than on brix levels waiting for the acids to go down at the same time they know they need healthy acidity to make fresh wines and they would like to rely less on acidification while growing seasons like ’ and ’ and probably ’ as well have been conducive to making wines in this style there will still remain the longerterm challenge of getting fruit phenolically ripe before grape sugars skyrocket and acidity levels plunge hence the constant search for cooler and generally higheraltitude sites with less brutal exposure to the sun more air movement and a potentially longer and less extreme growing season my annual trip to washington is always a voyage of discovery and this year i had the impression of experiencing early releases—and some barrel samples—from more potential future stars than ever before perhaps not a surprise as nearly  of the state’s roughly  wineries will release their first crop of wines from vintage  among emerging wineries of note are such producers as cadaretta winery efesté o’shea scarborough pacific rim trust cellars va piano and woodinville cellars add these to the list of producers

by seattle times wine adviser paul gregutt with each passing year my list of the years top  washington wines gets more competitive we now have nearly  wineries in the state so even limiting it to one listing per winery means that five out of six wineries wont even appear on the list washington wines do well on other top  lists and though these are not inexpensive wines they are far less expensive than most of the wines that show up elsewhere this list is the only one that focuses exclusively on wines made with washington grapes — and the only one compiled by a single individual living and working here whether or not you always agree with my choices i hope they will encourage you to explore many of the wineries listed from  to  on page  and not just for the specific wine on the list but for all of their wines quality is rarely an accident if the winery made one great wine they probably made quite a few really good ones every wine on this list has been scored  points or higher by me

wine—your own wine not someone elses your family isnt wealthy nor does it own vineyards or a winery both fairly highcapital enterprises what do you do to break into a very highstakes game ross mickel is doing it the hard way to get a toehold in the business he worked the harvest in oregons willamette valley picking up what he could during the most frenzied weeks in the winemakers year with a little experience under his belt he began apprenticing to established winemakers trading his labor for their experience in time he established an ongoing yearround relationship with bob betz one of the northwests most respected wine scientists and educators and in a very small way one of its most respected winemakers as well delivering betz wines to the specialty shops selected to carry them mickel made more connections so that when in  he released  cases  bottles under his own ross andrew label he wasnt just another unknown competing for top retailers attention and shelf space mickels ongoing association with betz also helped when buying grapes his second  release due out this fall was composed of fruit from name acreage like alder ridge boushey and hedges many beginning winemakers try to hedge their bets by making half a dozen different wines often distracted they fail to ring the bell with any for the foreseeable future mickel plans to make just one labeled as cabernet sauvignon but containing a legally permissible admixture of merlot fruit this choice has both advantages and disadvantages in washington as in california the cabernet market is dominated by famous labels with long pedigrees and commanding high prices a newcomer has to price his product modestly enough to persuade sophisticated buyers to experiment mickels  ross andrew will run  but high enough to indicate that hes serious about contending with the big names fair or not wines priced under  rarely develop much buzz where buzz counts a lot of cabernet winemakers go for maximum heft and impact the result can be impressive but rough and need a few years in bottle to lose their asperity mickel prefers a suaver approach the wine hes releasing this fall has been a year in bottle to date but a distinctive cabernet aroma apart its as easy on the palate as wines made mostly from the traditionally softer merlot grape though the blend is actually fourfifths cab mickel upped his production slightly for the  to  cases  cases of the  are slated for  release when you consider that the  ross andrew is already waiting to be blended before the  is released you can see why mickel favors a wine that asks to be drunk right away its a pretty big investment spending three years making wine before you find out whether anyone likes the style of wine you make food sips  august   august   meant to be by roger downey the ancient folkways of the grape never really took root in north america so its understandable if our winemakers tales are fraught with epiphanies sudden midlife course corrections abrupt tradeins of hot urban concrete for cool mother earth maybe its a sign that wine has finally gone native that an easygoing bellevue boy could drift into winemaking as if it were the most natural move in the world an english major at the university of washington ross mickel had his first brush with the wine game when a childhood friend suggested he work as a wine waiter at the friends familys restaurant since the childhood friend was mark canlis mickel abruptly found himself counseling some of the regions wealthiest and most knowledgeable wine consumers on their beverage choices before he was all that secure in the subject himself once in the wine bag mickel got serious flying to uc davis for weekend winemaking classes with luck and contacts at home ensuring that theory got blended with practice a college classmate working at woodinvilles delille cellars introduced mickel to delille winemaker chris upchurch who put him to work as a rat around the winery in another lucky twist ste michelle winemaker bob betz was using delilles plant to produce his own wines and mickel soon found himself assisting one of americas most admired winemakers in crafting his sparenoexpense boutique syrahs and bordeauxstyle blends in  mickel produced his first solo wine from the  harvest a fairly standard meritage blend of  percent cabernet sauvignon grapes  percent merlot and  percent cabernet franc but thanks to his reflected credibility from master of wine betz mickel was able to procure grapes from some of washingtons best growing sites including alder ridge milbrandt and taptiel briskly tannic without raspiness refreshingly acidic the threeyearold wine favors fruitiness over weight a distinct advantage when most washington reds no matter how gnarlyexcuse me ageworthyare consumed the year of their release mickel is delighted at the reception his debutant is getting i think people i know who taste it are thinking what can i say nice about it because after they do they say i like it no i really like it hell have no trouble placing the mere  cases made at about  per bottle that wont come close to paying off what mickel and his partners well parents have invested in the enterprise so far but its a great base to build on on the threshold of wider recognition does he regret not having a more stormy tale of struggle to tell not really ive been lucky sure but looking back it seems like it was all just meant to be where to buy and drink wine discussed in this weeks sips column ross andrew  columbia valley red is available on the wine lists of eva chez

pricing for other vintages of this wine about washington get the full story the proliferation of new wineries in washington state has slowed in the past couple of years but the landscape today is radically different from even  years ago as recently as the early s the washington wine scene was dominated by a few large players who also owned a high percentage of planted vineyard land today most of the excitement is being generated by small qualityminded wineries and the industrialscale producers are mostly competing at the low end of the market cabernet and merlot are washingtons most serious and successful varieties with syrah rapidly increasing in popularity thanks to the efforts of some talented newcomers red wine is generally growing as a percentage of total production of premium wines even if riesling still has considerable commercial importance most of washingtons grapes are grown in the desert east of the cascade mountains in the columbia and yakima river valleys where annual rainfall is so low that the vineyards must be irrigated the vines in washington benefit from long daylight hours during the summer and a longer growing season than california grapes are usually picked well into october although daytime temperatures can be quite hot frequently surpassing  degrees generally cool september nights allow the grapes to retain healthy acidity resulting in wines with noteworthy intensity of varietal character the greatest threat to grapegrowing in washington is winter frost which can sometimes be severe enough to kill vines as it did during the winters
