products company was one of the most successful wood products corporations in the united states in the twentieth century their largest most innovative and most important west coast plant was located at coos bay coos county oregon from  to  the company founder edward steptoe evans was a selfmade man who had worked as a printer a store clerk a cowhand a librarian and an author when finally at age thirtyfive he developed a product that made him a fortune  in  he created the evans block a small wooden device that made loading and shipping automobiles by rail more efficient  evanss involvement in the car industry led him naturally to produce another product for the automobile battery separators dozens of thin shields were needed to separate the numerous positive and negative plates inside storage batteries while allowing for the flow of the battery acids evanss research and development personnel found that port orford cedar was an ideal material for these separators evans opened a manufacturing plant on coos bay in  near the convergence of the coalbank and isthmus sloughs in order to be near the best stands of port orford cedar at various times evans products operations were also located in gold beach lebanon corvallis winchester and portland with the onset of world war ii battery separators for military vehicles tanks and submarines were in high demand and the coos bay plant produced over  million separators in  alone the heyday of operations was in the early 0s when over  laborers with an annual payroll of over three million dollars found work at the coos bay plant even during the great depression evans had hundreds of women workers in an industry that was traditionally male known as lumber jinneys a spinoff of the familiar term lumber jack these women predated the familiar rosie the riveter by at least a decade the evans company had a reputation for innovation and diversification besides battery separators it produced railroad ties fence posts and broom sticks in the s it also was the leading producer of high quality port orford cedar venetian blinds upon his fathers death in  edward s evans jr headed the company and continued with new product lines in response to the need for postwar housing the evans company manufactured lumber for prefabricated homes using  feet of fir lumber for framing wall panels cupboards and shelves the company claimed it could complete an evans house on a poured foundation in fortyeight hours by the 0s the company was an important producer of plywood it developed wooden stadium seats that were installed in the newly constructed marshfield high school gym and made high quality wooden furniture one author claims that the term wood products came into common use in the 0s and 0s as a result of the companys prominence the evans products company plant closed its doors in coos bay in the spring of  newspaper editorials at the time speculated the closure was due to the growing scarcity of port orford cedar increased foreign competition and the creation of other materials that replaced traditional wood products after a failed attempt to restart the business the city of coos bay burned the old evans buildings in  a section of highway 0 near the old plant site was designated evans boulevard one of the few reminders of this once important coos bay business images evans products co brochure cover  evans products
