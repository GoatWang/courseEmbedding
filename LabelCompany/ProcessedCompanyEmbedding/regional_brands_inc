billion in sales in    in the same study a rebound in housing completions and building construction expenditures is expected to drive approximately  growth per year in the industry through  this would represent a rebound from the  period with growth expected to be driven by both residential and nonresidential building construction activity   regional variations in economic activity influence the level of demand for windows and door products across the united states of particular importance are regional differences in the level of construction and renovation activity demographic trends

“adsi” which is advantageous to us in situations that require union installation labor individuals affiliated with lorraine capital llc acquired  of adsi’s common stock in connection with the acquisition            competition   our products are sold under highly competitive conditions currently we are principally in the upstate new york state market and we compete with a number of companies some of which have greater financial resources than us the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve include price product quality delivery and the ability to customize to customer specifications we encounter different competitive environments in each of our product categories in some of the product categories there is a reduction in the number of competitors in part due to the reduction of new entrants to the market in addition many of our suppliers find it economical to have a limited number of vendors in any geographic area in the residential market segment we face intense competition from bigbox stores large independent chains and online retailers where we differentiate our products and services with highend quality products that meet the specialized installation requirements of our customers in addition certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to customers or enter into exclusive supply arrangements with other distributors   suppliers   we operate as a multiline product distributor and installer across the entire upstate new york region for nationally and internationally recognized industry leading brands our ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner generally our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities   employees   brj llc employed  people fulltime and  person parttime as of december   regional brands has no employees other than its ceo   item a – risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment you should read the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report   risks relating to our business and industry   there can be no assurance that our future operations will result in net income   there can be no assurance that our future operations will result in net income our failure to increase our revenues or maintain or improve our gross margins will harm our business we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate our gross margins decline or our operating expenses exceed our expectations our operating results will suffer the prices we charge for products and services may decrease which would reduce our revenues and harm our business if we are unable to sell products at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we fail to supply on a timely basis new products and services from which we can derive additional revenues our financial results will suffer            uncertain economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products   our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for building products in the markets in which we operate economic weakness and constrained construction and renovation spending has resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings and growth rates all of our revenues and profitability are derived from our clients in new york state which makes us highly susceptible to disruptions or downturns in local economic conditions ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments delays or reductions in building products spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations financial condition cash flows and stock price   we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs expectations or trends which could adversely affect our relationship with customers our reputation and the demand for our products and services   the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics consumer preferences expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand as the housing and home improvement market continues to recover resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels our failure to meet the individual needs and expectations of our customers may result in the erosion of our customer base   our industry is highly cyclical and prolonged periods of weak demand or excess supply may reduce our net sales andor margins which may cause us to incur losses or reduce our net income   the building products distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures prices of building products are determined by overall supply and demand in the market market prices of building products historically have been volatile and cyclical and we have limited ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes demand for building products is driven mainly by factors outside of our control such as general economic and political conditions interest rates availability of financing the state of the credit markets high levels of unemployment and foreclosures the construction repair and remodeling markets industrial markets weather and population growth the supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity and excess capacity in the industry can result in significant declines in market prices for those products to the extent that prices and volumes experience a sustained or sharp decline our net sales and margins likely would decline as well   additionally many of the building products which we distribute are widely available from other distributors or manufacturers including bigbox stores and online retailers at times the purchase price for any one or more of the products we distribute may fall below our purchase costs requiring us to incur shortterm losses on product sales   all of these factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services our costs of doing business and our financial performance   product shortages loss of key suppliers and our dependence on thirdparty suppliers and manufacturers could affect our financial health   our ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner generally our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities however the loss of or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition operating results and cash flows            disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our products could adversely impact our business   a disruption within our supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased costs or damage to our reputation such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our warehouse facility weatherrelated events natural disasters thirdparty strikes lockouts work stoppages or slowdowns supply or shipping interruptions or costs or other factors beyond our control any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition   the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products our sales and our profit margins   prices of certain commodity products including lumber and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations periodic delays in delivery and other factors rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products our sales and our profit margins   our industry is highly competitive if we are unable to compete effectively our net sales and operating results will be reduced   the building products distribution industry is highly competitive particularly in the residential sector competitive factors in our industry include pricing availability of product level of service delivery capabilities customer relationships geographic coverage and breadth of product offerings also financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors for their products and affects the favorability of the terms on which we are able to obtain our products from our suppliers and sell our products to our customers   some of our competitors are part of larger companies and therefore have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access in addition certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to customers we also face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers additional manufacturers of products distributed by us may elect to sell and distribute directly to endusers in the future or enter into exclusive supply arrangements with other distributors competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices our margins or demand for our products and services if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures our net sales and net income will be reduced   our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters catastrophes fire or other unexpected events   we operate our business primarily out of a single facility while we maintain insurance including business interruption insurance our warehouse facility could be materially damaged by natural disasters fire adverse weather conditions or other unexpected events which could materially disrupt our business we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events including damage to our reputation andor suffer material losses in operational capacity which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   our cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our substantial indebtedness or to maintain acceptable liquidity   we have a substantial amount of debt which could have important consequences to you for example it could   · make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations · make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions · limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate requirements · expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our revolving credit facility is variable            · require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for operations and other purposes · limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and · place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt and therefore may be in a better position to obtain favorable credit terms   in addition our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance cash flows and capital resources which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others   · economic and demand factors affecting the building products distribution industry · external factors affecting availability of credit · pricing pressures · increased operating costs · competitive conditions and · other operating difficulties   if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell material assets or operations obtain additional capital or restructure our debt obtaining additional capital or restructuring our debt could be accomplished in part through new or additional borrowings or placements of debt or equity securities there is no assurance that we could obtain additional capital or refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all in the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations the value realized on the disposition of such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers accordingly any such sale may not among other things be for a sufficient dollar amount we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above   the instruments governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and the use of proceeds from any such disposition   our obligations under the debt agreements are secured by security interests in all of the assets of our operating subsidiary brj llc including its inventories accounts receivable and proceeds from those items the foregoing encumbrances as well as covenants in the debt agreements limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations accordingly we may not be able to consummate any disposition of assets or obtain the net proceeds which we could realize from such disposition and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet the debt service obligations when due in the event of our breach of the debt agreements we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated and the lenders may foreclose on their security interests in our assets or otherwise exercise their remedies with respect to such interests   the instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business including requiring us to maintain a maximum fixed charge coverage ratio   our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants and restrictions including financial covenants that limit management’s discretion in operating our business in particular these instruments limit our ability to among other things   · incur additional debt · grant liens on assets · make investments including capital expenditures · sell or acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business · engage in transactions with affiliates and            · make fundamental business changes   the credit facility also requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of  to  if we fail to comply with the restrictions in the debt agreements or any other current or future financing agreements a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debts and to exercise their remedies under these agreements which typically will include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt together with accrued and unpaid interest and other related amounts immediately due and payable to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds the exercise of any default remedies by our creditors would have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures   affiliates of ancora control a significant portion of our outstanding common stock and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders   ancora a private investment firm and investment partnerships and individuals affiliated with ancora beneficially owned approximately  of our outstanding common stock as of december   as a result ancora is able to exert significant influence on the election of our directors our corporate and management policies and the outcome of most corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including potential mergers or acquisitions asset sales and other significant corporate transactions this concentrated ownership position limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and as a result we may take actions that some of our stockholders may not view as beneficial   three of our four directors and our chief executive officer are affiliated with ancora the interests of ancora may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock additionally ancora is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us ancora may also pursue for its own account acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as ancora continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock it will continue to be able to strongly influence our decisions including potential mergers or acquisitions asset sales and other significant corporate transactions   we may not have sufficient working capital in the long term   it is likely we may require additional funds in the long term depending upon the growth of our revenues and our business strategy we can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient debt or equity capital now or in the future to support our operations should we be unable to raise sufficient debt or equity capital we could be forced to cease operations   these and other factors could affect our business financial condition and results of operations also it is possible that our financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts     risks related to our common stock   we have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock   we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future the payment of dividends on our common stock would depend on our earnings financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant if we do not pay dividends our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates   there is a limited market for our common stock which may make it more difficult to dispose of your stock   our common stock is currently quoted on the otc marketplace there is a limited trading market for our common stock accordingly there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for our common stock the ability of holders of our common stock to sell shares of our common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell their common stock because of its limited trading volume the price of our common stock may experience significant volatility for reasons that may be unrelated to our business or financial performance            a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of the common stock to decline   if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market the market price of our common stock could fall these sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate   failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act and disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting   section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  requires the company to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k   we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that material weaknesses exists in our internal control over financial reporting  the material weaknesses consist of an insufficient complement of qualified accounting personnel and controls associated with segregation of duties and ineffective controls associated with identifying and accounting for complex and nonroutine transactions in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures there may be errors in the company’s financial statements and in the accompanying footnote disclosures that could require restatements as a result investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and disclosure which could negatively impact our stock price   we do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls over time controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   item b – unresolved staff comments   none   item   properties   our

levels of activities subsequent to our change in control in april    other income expense during the year ended september   our net other income was  compared to net other expense of  during the

arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition financial statements revenues or expenses   inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the last two years            critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes  the financial statements as of september   describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements  actual results could differ from those estimates and be based on events different from those assumptions  future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty estimating therefore requires the exercise of judgment thus accounting estimates change as new events occur as more experience is acquired or as additional information is obtained  the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements   fair value of financial instruments  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fair value measurement topic of the fasb asc establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements these tiers include     ● level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets         ● level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and         ● level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable   sharebased payments we record our common shares issued based on the value of the shares issued or consideration received including cash services rendered or other nonmonetary assets whichever is more readily determinable   acquisitions   we account for our acquisitions under asc topic  business combinations and reorganizations “asc topic ” asc topic  provides guidance on how the acquirer recognizes and measures the consideration transferred identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination asc topic  also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations   when we acquire a business we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values we record any premium over the fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair value the way we characterize the assets has important implications as longlived assets with definitive lives for example are depreciated or amortized whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment with respect to determining the fair value of assets the most subjective estimates involve valuations of longlived assets such as property plant and equipment as well as identified intangible assets we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage independent valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired longlived assets the fair values of longlived assets are determined using valuation techniques that use discounted cash flow methods independent market appraisals and other acceptable valuation techniques            item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable   item   financial statements and supplementary data   our audited financial statements as of and for the years ended september   and  follow item  beginning at page f   item   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   on november   upon the closing of the transactions we dismissed anton and chia llp “ac” as our independent registered public accounting firm which was recommended and approved by our board of directors the “board” on november   ac audited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended september   the reason for the replacement of ac was that following the acquisition brj llc will carry on the business formerly conducted by brj inc and the current independent registered public accountants of brj inc is the firm of freed maxick cpas pc “freed maxick” we believe that it is in our best interest to have freed maxick continue to work with our business and we therefore retained freed maxick as our new independent registered public accounting firm effective november   freed maxick is located at  main street suite  buffalo new york    the decision to change auditors and the appointment of freed maxick was recommended and approved by our board during our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim periods prior to november   we did not consult freed maxick regarding either i the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction completed or proposed or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our company’s financial statements or ii any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as defined in item aiv of regulation sk or a reportable event as described in item av of regulation sk   ac’s report on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended september   did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified as audit scope or accounting principles however such yearend report did contain a modification paragraph that expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   during the fiscal year ended september   and the subsequent interim periods prior to november   i there were no disagreements between us and ac on any matter of accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which if not resolved to the satisfaction of ac would have caused ac to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports and ii there were no “reportable events” as described in item aiv of regulation sk of the securities act or the securities exchange act of  as amended the decision to replace ac was not the result of any disagreement between us and ac on any matter of accounting principle or practice financial statement disclosure or audit procedure our board deemed it in our best interest to change independent auditors following the closing of the transactions   item a  controls and procedures   management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over

period covered by this annual report concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september   as required by paragraph b of exchange act rules a or d and has determined our controls were not effective due to material weaknesses that exist the material weaknesses consist of an insufficient complement of qualified accounting personnel and controls associated with segregation of duties and ineffective controls associated with identifying and accounting for complex and nonroutine transactions in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles   to address the material weaknesses we performed additional analyses and other postclosing procedures and retained the services of a consultant to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  notwithstanding these material weaknesses management believes that the financial statements included in this annual report on form k fairly present in all material respects our financial condition result of operations and cash flows for the periods presented   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm

in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements these tiers include     ● level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets         ● level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and         ● level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or

website at aim our company tagline is the brands behind the brand and its a reasonable question to ask why is a company with a national brand touting its regional brands the reason we emphasize the regional brands of our company is because this a competitive difference between aim and our competition including many of the products sold nationally through multiple distribution channels most national brands use a one size fits all approach  meaning that their formulations are offered independent of the location or region of a building project this serves a manufacturers interest to offer one product that serves the needs of many geographical areas of north america in contrast at aim our products  whether roof coatings cements or adhesives are formulated for the distinct exterior weather extremes of various north american areas for large building projects especially construction or restoration of facilities located in multiple areas this means a project manager can find an aim product that is optimized for multiple distinct regions  without compromising quality the generic formulations of many other national brands often requires a quality compromise simply put what works in pennsylvania may not be viable in florida and viceversaaim’s regional formulations also address varying voc and associated regulatory requirements aim performs the background work to ensure that its formulas are within environmental compliance as aim strives to reduce the regulatory concerns of aim’s customers see our environmental policy statement for more details only at aim can you get not
