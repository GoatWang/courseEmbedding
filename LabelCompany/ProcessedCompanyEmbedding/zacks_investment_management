fulltime more than a yearpros“good work life balance you can work a  and not bring work home some employees are fun some of the team members are fun cant say the same about upper level management great location youre right in the loop building could be a little nicer but you cant complain”consorganizational structure  management upper level management while being accessible will not go out of their way to say hi to you while passing them in the hallwaybenefits zacks cuts cost at every corner expect no matching on k fairly expensive health premiumscompensation compensation is highly negotiable basically everyone is made a terrible offer by zim a lot of people will counter offer and work out a better compensation agreement contracts are poorly written by design expect the company to try and find excuses not to pay you upper level management doesnt realize that if they offered slightly more competitive salaries and benefits that they would attract better talenttraining depending on the position training can be nonexistent or fairly robust this varies because managers are in charge of thisopportunities for advancement if you do well you will be recognized for your work be cautious with taking on new work as this is often the result of other employees not wanting to do the work themselvesculture fairly good group of people to work with no employee events organized by zacks except for the once a year christmas dinner this is most likely because these events cost money also expect for there to be no alcohol at any eventscommunication extremely poor communication employees are routinely lied to by upper level management and everything seems to be kept a secret culture starts from the top down and management will routinely ignore emails when its convenient to do socheapness this is the cheapest company i have ever worked for employees are encouraged to use free versions of software getting a  a month subscription for a program that would allow you to work much more efficiently for the firm would be a headache company recently discontinued laptop purchase program which is basically a loan that goes away after  years of working there one year there wasnt even a christmas party dont expect any catered lunches snacks etc there is a snack machine in the kitchen that the company probably makes money off of your computer wont have an internet filter most likely because this costs money theres a theme here cut costs to the detriment of your companyadvice to managementstop nickeling and diming employees with poor management decisions for example zacks doesnt pay for flu shots which makes zero sense if you pay for flu shots your employees are much more likely to get them and theyll get sick less often meaning they will work more for you its this shortsightedness that is pervasive at zacks youre not being thrifty youre being cheap and its hurting your companyshare on facebookshare on twittershare on whatsappshare via
