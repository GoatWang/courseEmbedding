debt securities however mdsix only intends to invest in  to  year duration securities investments in us agency mortgage backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of such as prepayment risk extension risk and possible illiquidity the md sass equity income plus fund invests in a limited number of companies therefore changes in the value of a single security may have a more significant effect on the value of the funds portfolio than for other funds that invest in a greater number of companies the fund invests in midcap companies which involves additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than large capitalization companies the fund invests in options which may be more volatile than investments directly in the underlying securities involve additional costs and may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed when the fund writes a call option its ability to participate in the capital appreciation of the

underlying index may subsequently change if such a change causes the exercised option to fall outofthemoney the fund will be required to pay the difference between the closing index value and the exercise price of the option times the applicable multiplier to the assigned writer if an index put option purchased by the fund were permitted to expire without being exercised its premium would

department of insurance placed executive life into receivership and the bonds went into default soon thereafter in october  sass was sued by one of its pension fund clients the alameda county employees retirement association  acera acera is seeking damages of approximately  for its losses on the bonds four other pension fund clients have filed similar actions against sass in other federal courts around the country these actions make up the underlying lawsuits the multidistrict panel on litigation has consolidated all of the underlying lawsuits including the one by acera for pretrial proceedings in the eastern district of louisiana  b the insurance policy sass brought this action against reliance seeking among other things a declaration that it is covered under the terms of its investment advisors liability insurance policy the policy the policy was issued on december   and was renewed for a one year term on december   and december   under the policy reliance agreed to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages resulting from any claims first made against the insured during the policy period  for any wrongful act of the insured or of any other person for whose actions the insured is legally liable but only if such wrongful act first occurs during or prior to the policy period reliance also agreed to defend any claim made against the insured seeking damages on account of a wrongful act even if such claim is groundless false or fraudulent the policy also includes a prior knowledge exclusion clause exclusion e of the policy provides that the policy does not apply to any wrongful act committed prior to the beginning of the policy period if on or before the inception date of this policy the insured knew or could have reasonably known that such wrongful act could lead to a claim emphasis supplied  c reliances denial of coverage reliance does not contend that the underlying lawsuits are not covered under the terms of the policy instead reliance bases its denial of coverage on exclusion e stating that the basis of such disclaimer here was that the plaintiffs had knowledge of a wrongful act or wrongful acts prior to the inception of the  renewal policy which might result in such claims being made against them reliances answer to sasss complaint ¶  reliance argues that its disclaimer was justified for two reasons first according to reliance sass knew or should have known during late  about executive lifes financial difficulties and the bonds market decline second in june  sass received a letter from a client threatening to hold it responsible for any losses from the bonds which reliance claims put sass on notice of other possible claims  d this courts previous order denying summary judgment on june   this court entered an order re summary judgment the order the court addressed crossmotions for summary judgment by sass and reliance on the issue of whether reliance is liable to indemnify sass under the policy the court construed as a matter of law the term inception date in exclusion e as referring to the renewal date of the policy and not to the date of the original policy thus the court concluded the underlying factual issue on which reliances liability for coverage depends is whether sass  knew or could reasonably have known of wrongful acts prior to december   order at  the court stated that the answer to this question is one of fact which must be reserved for the trier of fact the court held that when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to sass a reasonable fact finder could conclude that sass could not have reasonably known of wrongful acts and reliance would consequently be liable for coverage under the policy  when viewed the opposite way a fact finder could easily conclude that sass was on sufficient notice of potential claims against it that coverage is properly disclaimed pursuant to exclusion e order at  the court therefore denied both motions for summary judgment the court also addressed sasss argument that reliance was estopped from denying coverage sass based its estoppel theory on alleged representations by reliance in its renewal application that sass need not disclose certain prior wrongful acts which then turned out to the basis for reliances disclaimer under exclusion e the court found however that in this case  reliance never made an affirmative representation that prior wrongful acts of which sass knew or could reasonably be expected to know were covered certainly the renewal application made no such representation order at  accordingly the court held that the first element of estoppel a material misrepresentation is not proved order at   e the motions currently before the court sass now moves for summary judgment on its claim for declaratory relief seeking a declaration that reliance has a duty to defend sass in the underlying lawsuits pending the resolution of the coverage dispute reliance has filed a crossmotion seeking summary judgment on sasss claims of bad faith breach of fiduciary duty fraud and negligent misrepresentation both parties argue that this courts order mandates that their motions be granted sass has also filed two other motions first it seeks leave to amend the complaint which sass contends would eliminate the need to decide reliances motion second in the event sasss motion for declaratory relief on reliances duty to defend is successful sass moves the court to stay the proceedings on the coverage issue pending the outcome of the underlying lawsuits  iii summary judgment standard summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue of material fact or when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party the movant is clearly entitled to prevail as a matter of law fedrcivp c jung v fmc corp  fd   th cir  the party moving for summary judgment has the burden of proving the absence of any genuine issue of material fact that would allow a judgment as a matter of law anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    s ct    l ed d   once the moving party demonstrates the absence of any genuine issue of material fact however the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict in his favor id at   s ct at  to meet this burden the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and show by her own affidavits or by the depositions answers to interrogatories or admissions on file that a genuine issue of material fact exists celotex corp v catrett  us    s ct    l ed d   in addition to withstand a motion for summary judgment the nonmoving party must show that there are genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party liberty lobby  us at   s ct at    iv discussion  a sasss motion for summary judgment    choice of law in an action brought under diversity jurisdiction the district court applies the choice of law analysis of the state in which it sits liew v official receiver  liquidator  fd   th cir  citing klaxon co v stentor elec mfg co  us   s ct   l ed   the court is to decide state law issues as would the supreme court of the forum state cir v estate of bosch  us    s ct    l ed d   the california supreme court uses a governmental interests test which requires the court to find the proper law to apply based upon the interests of the litigants and the involved states offshore rental co v continental oil co  cal d    cal rptr   pd   however there is no conflict in applying california law to a dispute if the same outcome would be reached under the law of each of the states involved see hurtado v superior court  cal d    cal rptr   pd   the parties here have not fully briefed this court on the choice of law issue they seem to be in agreement however that either california or new york law applies to the issue of reliances duty to defend sass in the underlying lawsuits as is shown below the result would be the same under either california or new york law   an insurers duty to defend it is well settled that california law obligates an insurer to provide its insured with a defense against claims that create a potential for indemnity the carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy gray v zurich ins co  cal d    cal rptr   pd   emphasis in original the insurers duty to defend is thus much broader than the duty to indemnify one california court has held that the duty to defend is so broad that as long as the complaint contains language creating the potential for liability  the insurer must defend an action against its insured even though it has independent knowledge of facts not in the pleadings that indicate that claim is not covered cna casualty of california v seaboard surety co  cal app d    cal rptr   this case could be read as holding that under california law an insurer can never rely on extrinsic evidence to avoid the duty to defend other california cases have allowed an insurer to rely on extrinsic evidence to avoid the duty to defend but these cases demonstrate that an insurer can avoid the duty to defend only when it is conclusively proven that there is no potential for coverage see eg saylin v california ins guarantee assn  cal app d    cal rptr   discovery showed conclusively that act did not occur within policy period fire ins exchange v jiminez  cal app d    cal rptr   uncontradicted evidence showed that policy did not cover property where the accident occurred similarly the new york courts have recognized that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify new york law requires an insurer to defend its insured in a lawsuit if there is a reasonable possibility that the insured may be held liable for some act or omission covered under the policy fitzpatrick v american honda motor co inc  nyd   nysd    ned    villa charlotte bronte inc v commercial union ins co  nyd   nysd   ned   is almost directly on point in that case an insured moved for partial summary judgment that his insured was obligated to defend him in a lawsuit the insurer opposed the motion based on the alleged applicability of an exclusion clause in the policy the new york court of appeals reversed the trial courts denial of summary judgment holding that the insurer could only be excused from defending its insured because of the language of the policy exclusion  if it could establish as a matter of law that there is no possible factual or legal basis on which the insurer might eventually be obligated to indemnify him  nysd at   ned at  the findings in this courts previous order then obligate reliance to defend sass in the underlying lawsuits when this court denied reliances previous motion for summary judgment it necessarily held that reliance could not show conclusively that sass had knowledge of any prior wrongful acts there remains a possibility that the jury will find that sass had no such knowledge making reliance liable under the policy as long as this potential for liability exists reliance must defend sass in the underlying lawsuits reliance contends that it is not obligated to defend sass because exclusion e in reliances terms is a policy defense as opposed to a coverage defense according to reliance an insurer possesses a coverage defense when the acts complained of do not fall within the insurance coverage and a policy defense when the insured by some act or omission has harmed the relationship between the insurer and the insured reliance holds out an insufficient notice defense that is where the insured fails to give the insurer proper notice of a claim as an example of a policy defense it further claims that the prior knowledge language in exclusion e should be seen as a policy defense not a coverage defense reliance argues that there is never a duty to provide an interim defense pending the adjudication of a policy defense for support reliance cites the california case of select ins co v superior court  cal app d   cal rptr   in that case the insurer successfully raised an issue of whether its insured had given it proper notice of the claim under the provisions in its policy the court held that before the insured is entitled to summary adjudication on the duty to defend the notice defense must be adjudicated id at   cal rptr  the select case though makes no mention of the supposed distinction between a coverage defense and a policy defense in fact reliance can point to no case that recognizes this distinction this court also refuses to recognize such a distinction for to do so would eviscerate the holding in gray a seminal case in california insurance law as well as similar holdings by the courts of new york gray and its progeny clearly recognize that the insurer has a duty to defend as long as there is any potential for liability under the policy moreover the select case can be distinguished from the case at bar because compliance with a notice provision in an insurance policy can be seen as a condition precedent to the insurers duty to defend in other words an insured must properly comply with the notice provisions of its policy before the insurers duty to defend arises reliance does not claim that sass failed to comply with any condition precedent to the policy rather it relies on exclusion e which is by its terms a coverage exclusion the rationale of select simply does not apply to coverage exclusions as noted above this court has already determined that whether sass had prior knowledge of any wrongful acts which would justify reliances disclaimer of liability pursuant to exclusion e is an issue for the jury until that issue is decided reliance has a duty to defend sass in the underlying lawsuits sasss motion for summary judgment therefore is granted and reliance is ordered to provide sass with a defense in the underlying lawsuits  b reliances motion for summary judgment reliance is moving for summary judgment on sasss claims of bad faith breach of fiduciary duty fraud and negligent misrepresentation again the parties did not brief the court on the choice of law issue this court believes however that  the result would be the same under california law as under the law of any of the other interested states thus there is no conflict in applying california law hurtado v superior court  cal d    cal rptr   pd     sasss claims of bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty under california law an insurer can be held liable in tort for bad faith in refusing to bestow policy benefits see gruenberg v aetna ins co  cal d    cal rptr   pd   the insured must prove that the insurer withheld policy benefits without proper cause california shoppers inc v royal globe ins co  cal app d    cal rptr   in addition an insurer holds itself out as a fiduciary so a wrongful denial of benefits would be a breach of fiduciary duty see frommoethelydo v fire ins exchange  cal d    cal rptr   pd   reliance argues that this courts findings in its previous order mandate summary judgment in its favor the court stated in its order that a fact finder could easily conclude that sass was on sufficient notice of potential claims against it that coverage is properly disclaimed pursuant to exclusion e order at  reliance argues that since it is possible that a jury can find in its favor it did not act in bad faith as a matter of law what reliance fails to note is that when the court made the above statement it was viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to reliance there is no guarantee that the jury will do the same moreover for the purposes of reliances motion this court must do the opposite in its previous order this court held that whether reliance had a basis for disclaiming coverage under exclusion e was a question of fact which must be reserved for the trier of fact order at  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sass the court held that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that sass could not reasonably have known of wrongful acts and reliance would consequently be liable under the policy id if the jury indeed decides this issue in sasss favor they also may decide that reliances disclaimer of coverage was without proper cause or wrongful under the circumstances this precludes summary judgment for reliance on sasss claims of bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty as to these claims reliances motion for summary judgment is denied   sasss claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation sasss claim for fraud and deceit alleges an intentional misrepresentation by reliance sass also alleges a claim for negligent misrepresentation this court found in its previous order that reliance had not made any material misrepresentation and that none could be found in its policy or in the renewal application order at  this finding is now part of the law of the case because an affirmative misrepresentation is a necessary element of sasss claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation reliance is entitled to summary judgment on these claims  c sasss motion for leave to amend sass is seeking leave to amend to allege new bases for the claims addressed in reliances motion for summary judgment sass claims it is doing so only out of an abundance of caution such caution on the part of sass is unnecessary as to sasss claims for bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty its complaint is sufficient to put reliance on notice of the nature of the claims against it in the light of this decision and this courts previous order the only factual issue left to be decided on sasss claims for bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty is whether reliances denial of coverage was wrongful or without proper cause sasss complaint alleges this adequately as to sasss claims for fraud and intentional misrepresentation they have been rendered a nullity by this courts previous order and reliance is entitled to partial  summary judgment see supra part iv b thus amendment of the complaint on those two claims would be futile see lockman foundation v evangelical alliance mission  fd   th cir  leave to amend improper if amendment would be futile sasss motion for leave to amend is denied  d sasss motion to stay the proceedings the court has broad discretion to stay a declaratory judgment proceeding on insurance coverage pending the outcome of the underlying action against the insured terra nova ins co ltd v  bar inc  fd   d cir as noted above this court is ordering reliance to defend sass in the underlying lawsuits see supra part iva sass now moves to stay the declaratory proceeding on the coverage issue pending resolution of the underlying lawsuits there are no ninth circuit cases addressing the issue directly the third circuit though has set forth a list of factors for the district court to consider in deciding whether to exercise its discretion see terra nova  fd at  the district court should consider  the likelihood that the declaration will resolve the uncertainty of obligation which gave rise to the controversy  the convenience of the parties  the public interest in the settlement of the uncertainty of obligation  the availability and convenience of other remedies and  whether the same factual question lies at the heart of both the insurance coverage dispute and the underlying action id see also remington arms v liberty mutual ins  f supp   ddel obviously a declaratory judgment in this case will resolve the uncertainty of obligation between sass and reliance a declaration either for or against sass would be extremely helpful to the parties in guiding their future course of conduct see remington arms  f supp at  with respect to the convenience of the parties sass would prefer to avoid expending effort now to establish its right to indemnification because reliance is obligated to defend it in the meantime in the underlying lawsuits on the other hand it would be extremely unfair to reliance not to allow it to adjudicate its defense that sass had prior knowledge of the claims that led to the underlying lawsuits the court in remington arms resolved this issue in favor of the insurer on the theory that where it is the insured that brought the declaratory action in the first place the scales tip in favor of the insureds desire to go forward on the indemnification claims id this reasoning is applicable here when sass brought this action it immediately moved for summary judgment on the indemnification issue which was denied because the court found a triable issue of fact in reliances defense now sass is turning around and requesting a stay of the same proceeding attempting to turn its temporary victory on the duty to defend issue into a permanent one this court believes that on the balance the equities favor allowing reliance to adjudicate its defense in this declaratory proceeding instead of waiting for the results of the underlying lawsuits the third factor to consider is the publics interest in the settling the uncertainty of the obligation this obviously cuts in favor of denying the stay requested by sass the public including the plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuits has a substantial interest in knowing whether the ultimate liability if any for the bonds collapse in the market will fall on sass or its insurer the other remedy at issue proceeding to trial on the indemnification issue is more convenient than staying the action as the parties are currently involved in discovery on this issue it would be inconvenient to stay these proceedings now only to have to begin them again potentially at a later date the final factor for the court to consider is whether it would be required to make factual findings which are also subject to determination in the underlying lawsuits sass notes that there are many factual issues which are common to this action and  the underlying lawsuits for example the key issue in the declaratory proceeding is whether sass had knowledge of any wrongful acts on its part a finding on this issue certainly would be relevant in the underlying lawsuits on the issue of whether sass breached any duty owed its clients sass contends that if this factual issue is determined adversely to it in this action the plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuits possibly could estop sass from relitigating it in the underlying lawsuits see parklane hosiery co v shore  us    s ct    l ed d   offensive collateral estoppel by nonparty allowed where defendant was party in prior action sass is concerned that this would put reliance in the position of aiding the plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuits by litigating crucial issues for them in the declaratory proceeding because reliance has a duty to defend sass from these very same plaintiffs reliance has a conflict of interest sass contends that this warrants a stay of the declaratory proceeding this potential conflict of interest however most likely will not arise it is settled law that when an insurer has a conflict of interest with its insured based on possible noncoverage under the policy the insurer must defend by paying the insureds attorneys fees for an independent counsel of the insureds choice see san diego fed credit union v cumis ins soc  cal app d    cal rptr   thus reliance is not necessarily put in the position of arguing one side of the factual issues in this action and then actually litigating the opposite side in the underlying lawsuits reliance needs only to pick up the tab for sasss defense it does not have to actually participate in the underlying lawsuits and in fact it must not do so if any conflict of interest exists moreover the mere possibility of collateral estoppel does not justify a stay of the declaratory proceeding sass is fully aware of the stakes in this litigation so it has every incentive to litigate the factual issues to the best of its ability if sass does so and happens to lose it cannot claim to be prejudiced in any sense by being precluded from litigating the same issues in the underlying lawsuits sass also contends that a stay is necessary to protect its reasonable expectations under the policy sass claims that it could not reasonably expect to face the superior resources of its insurer in this action particularly when it paid for a policy obligating reliance to defend it in the underlying lawsuits though the court is sympathetic to this argument it cannot be said that an insured reasonably expects that its insurer will not litigate a possible defense against it if such defense has a factual basis on the balance this court finds that the above factors do not justify staying the declaratory proceeding on the coverage issue sasss motion to stay the proceeding is denied  v conclusion in accordance with the foregoing it is hereby ordered that sasss motion for partial summary judgment is granted reliance is hereby ordered to provide sass with a defense in the underlying lawsuits reliances motion for partial summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part as to sasss claims for bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty reliances motion for summary judgment is denied as to sasss claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation reliances motion for summary judgment is granted sasss motion for leave to amend is denied sasss motion to stay the declaratory proceeding on the indemnification issue is denied it is so ordered notes  the underlying
