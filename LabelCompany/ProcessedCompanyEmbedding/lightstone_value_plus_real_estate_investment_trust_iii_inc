promissory notes were repaid in full on july   and terminated revolving credit facility on july   we through certain subsidiaries entered into a  million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with western alliance bank western the revolving credit facility bears interest at libor plus  and provides a line of credit over the next three years with two oneyear options to extend solely at the discretion of western the revolving credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default interest is payable monthly and the entire unpaid principal balance is due upon expiration of the revolving credit facility under the terms of the revolving credit facility we may designate properties as collateral that allows us to borrow up to a  loantovalue ratio of the properties on july   we received initial advances aggregating  million under the revolving credit facility which is secured by five hotel properties consisting of the springhill suites  green bay the hampton inn  des moines the hampton inn  lansing the courtyard  durham and the courtyard  warwick and as a result  million remained available under the revolving credit facility approximately  million of the financing proceeds were used to repay in full the aggregate outstanding principal and interest on the lansing promissory note and the green bay promissory note which were terminated in connection with the closing of the revolving credit facility the remaining financing proceeds of approximately  million may be used for acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other general corporate funding purposes including distributions we intend to limit our aggregate longterm permanent borrowings to  of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit as such our aggregate longterm permanent borrowings may be less than  of aggregate fair market value of all properties we may also incur shortterm indebtedness having a maturity of two years or less our charter provides that the aggregate amount of our borrowing both secured and unsecured may not exceed  of net assets in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate the approval of our board of directors and disclosure to stockholders net assets means our total assets other than intangibles at cost before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves less our total liabilities calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied any excess in borrowing over such  of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders along with justification for such excess market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit as such our aggregate borrowings may be less than  of net assets as of june   our total borrowings were approximately  million which represented  of our net assets our future borrowings may consist of singleproperty mortgages as well as mortgages crosscollateralized by a pool of properties such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash in addition we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages generally though not exclusively we intend to seek to encumber our properties with nonrecourse debt this means that a lenders rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property however we may at our discretion secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms when we give a guaranty for a property owning entity we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property owning entity in general the type of future financing executed by us to a large extent will be dictated by the nature of the investment and current market conditions for longterm real estate investments it is our intent to finance future acquisitions using longterm fixed rate debt however there may be certain types of investments and market circumstances which may result in variable rate debt being the more appropriate choice of financing to the extent floating rate debt is used to finance the purchase of real estate management will evaluate a    aug   c  cybernet data

the staybridge suites austin located austin texas current environment our operating results as well as our investment opportunities are impacted by the health of the north american economies our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions such as availability of credit financial markets volatility and recession our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the us and global economies these conditions may materially affect the value and performance of our properties and may affect our ability to pay distributions the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing and our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due we are not aware of any other material trends or uncertainties favorable or unfavorable other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from the acquisition and operation of real estate and real estate related investments other than those referred to in this form k critical accounting estimates and policies general our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report include our accounts and the operating partnership over which we exercise financial and operating control all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain these estimates and judgments may affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including contingencies and litigation we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions to assist in understanding our results of operations and financial position we have identified our critical accounting policies and discussed them below these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our results and financial position either because of the significance of the financial statement items to which they relate or because they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments investments in real estate we record investments in real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset we expense costs of repairs and maintenance as incurred we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of our real estate assets which is approximately  years for buildings and improvements  to  years for furniture and fixtures we make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate these assessments will have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate these investments over fewer years resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property we review the recoverability of the propertys carrying value the review of recoverability will be based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the propertys use and eventual disposition our forecast of these cash flows will consider factors such as expected future operating income market and other applicable trends and residual value as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate we will evaluate our ability to collect both interest and principal related to any real estate related investments in which we invest if circumstances indicate that such investment is impaired we reduce the carrying value of the investment to its net realizable value such reduction in value will be reflected as a charge to operations in the period in which the determination is made real estate purchase price allocation when we make an investment in real estate the fair value of the real estate acquired will be allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and tenant improvements identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovemarket and belowmarket leases for acquired inplace leases and the value of tenant relationships and certain liabilities such as assumed debt and contingent liabilities based in each case on their fair values purchase accounting will be applied to assets and liabilities related to real estate entities acquired based upon the percentage of interest acquired fees incurred related to acquisitions will be expensed as incurred within general and administrative costs within the consolidated statements of operations transaction costs such as professional fees commissions acquisition fees and closing costs incurred related to our investment in unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be capitalized as part of the cost of the investment upon acquisition of real estate operating properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed debt and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition based upon an evaluation of information and estimates available at that date including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other relevant market data based on these estimates we evaluate the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase and will allocate the initial purchase price to the applicable assets liabilities and noncontrolling interest if any as final information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments will be made to the purchase price allocation the allocations will be finalized within twelve months of the acquisition date revenue recognition and valuation of related receivables our revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from the operations of hotels hotel revenue will be recognized as earned which is generally defined as the date upon which a guest occupies a room or utilizes the hotels services accounting for organization and other offering costs we record selling commissions and dealer manager fees paid to our dealer manager and other thirdparty offering expenses such as registration fees due diligence fees marketing costs and professional fees as reduction against additional paidin capital any organization costs are expensed to general and administrative costs treatment of management compensation expense reimbursements management of our operations is outsourced to our advisor and certain other affiliates of our sponsor fees related to each of these services are accounted for based on the nature of such service and the relevant accounting literature fees for services performed that represent our period costs are expensed as incurred such fees include acquisition fees associated with the purchase of interests in real estate entities asset management fees paid to our advisor and property management fees paid to affiliates of our advisor these fees are expensed or capitalized to the basis of acquired assets as appropriate affiliates of our advisor may also perform feebased construction management services for both our development and redevelopment activities and tenant construction projects these fees will be considered incremental to the construction effort and will be capitalized to the associated real estate project as incurred costs incurred for tenant construction will be depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the term of the related lease costs related to development and redevelopment activities will be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the associated project leasing activity at our properties may be outsourced to affiliates of our advisor any corresponding leasing fees we pay will be capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease expense reimbursements made to both our advisor and affiliates of our advisor will be expensed or capitalized to the basis of acquired assets as appropriate income taxes we elected to qualify and be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended december   as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least  of our reit taxable income which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a reit for the fouryear period following our failure to qualify as a reit such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders we engage in certain activities through taxable reit subsidiaries trss when we purchase a hotel we establish a trs and enter into an operating lease agreement for the hotel as such we may be subject to us federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities as of december   and  we had no material uncertain income tax positions additionally even if we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we may still be subject to some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property and to us federal income taxes

real estate investment trust ii inc lightstone ii a reit also sponsored by the companys sponsor financial condition liquidity and capital resources overview for the year ended december   our primary source of funds were i  million of proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock under our offering we have and intend to continue to utilize leverage either in connection with acquiring our properties or subsequent to their acquisition the number of different properties we acquire will be affected by numerous factors including the amount of funds available to us when interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to us we may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time our future sources of funds are expected to primarily consist of i proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock under our offering ii cash flows from our operations iii proceeds from our borrowings and iv proceeds from the potential sale of additional subordinated participation interests to the special limited partner and v proceeds from our drip we currently believe that these cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from other than these sources within the next twelve months we intend to limit our aggregate longterm permanent borrowings to  of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit as such our aggregate longterm permanent borrowings may be less than  of aggregate fair market value of all properties we may also incur shortterm indebtedness having a maturity of two years or less our charter provides that the aggregate amount of our borrowing both secured and unsecured may not exceed  of net assets in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate the approval of our board of directors and disclosure to stockholders net assets means our total assets other than intangibles at cost before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves less our total liabilities calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied any excess in borrowing over such  of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders along with justification for such excess market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit as such our aggregate borrowings may be less than  of net assets as of december   our total borrowings were  million which represented  of our net assets our future borrowings may consist of singleproperty mortgages as well as mortgages crosscollateralized by a pool of properties such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash in addition we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages generally though not exclusively we intend to seek to encumber our properties with nonrecourse debt this means that a lenders rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property however we may at our discretion secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms when we give a guaranty for a property owning entity we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property owning entity in general the type of future financing executed by us to a large extent will be dictated by the nature of the investment and current market conditions for longterm real estate investments it is our
