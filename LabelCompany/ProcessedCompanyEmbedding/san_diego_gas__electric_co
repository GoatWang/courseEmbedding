responsible for  million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages during the trial the plaintiffs attorney argued that sdge was negligent because of its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over  feet  m in height the company said the power line had been on the base for  years and that sdge would have installed lights if the marine corps had asked since the crash the company has installed lights said todd macaluso the lawyer for the families sdge said that it would appeal the judgment  countywide power outageedit see also  southwest blackout on september   at
