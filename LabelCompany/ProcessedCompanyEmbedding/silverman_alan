finra’s brokercheck back to top about silvermans home uniforms for kids contact since  silverman’s always focused on serving the local community silvermans was known for having everything local customers needed at the lowest possible prices including many items that couldn’t be found anywhere else sadly in  after serious consideration the last of the silvermans stores has closed silverman’s began as surplus value center a single store at th and st clair in  it moved and adopted the name surplus city then in  the name was changed to silverman’s to reflect its full line of discount merchandise it all started just after wwii when marcus silverman enlisted the help of his brothers dave irv and sid and began selling government surplus goods customers came from all over the city for everyday items which back then were often hard to find like underwear socks shirts and rain wear as well as specialty items like telescopes binoculars and tools as government surplus goods diminished and consumer products became more widely available more family joined the business sanford maury charlotte evelyn selma ralph lenny and josh the silverman family went all over to purchase items their customers wanted as times changed they added more household goods fashion clothing school uniforms and s of other items to their selection of products through the hard work of the companys excellent staff and the loyalty of its customers silvermans eventually expanded to  stores the staff was proud of the fact that they out lived many of the big chains they once competed against like ames cooks gaylords gold circle hills uncle bills zayres and others it is bitter sweet that silvermans is closing after all these years but alan silverman has been working at silvermans all his adult life and has decided to take it easier in closing alan thanked all of silvermans customers and associates for their support and friendship over the years he said  i plan to continue to be a major supporter of uniforms for kids because i believe every child deserves to go to school dressed to succeed i am looking forward to spending more time on uniforms for kids in the future and
