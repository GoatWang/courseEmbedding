by human progress and why is it important to investing a  we believe that it is difficult to invest successfully without a view regarding the direction we are heading and by “we” we mean the entire world there are a handful of very important longterm secular trends underway that are quite clearly reshaping the planet  these changes have political social cultural economic and importantly for us investment implications  the breakneck speed of business and innovation the dramatic and stunning rise of china and asia the increasing demands for energy on a global scale and the inexorable shift to alternative energy are just some of the forces that are profoundly reshaping the world around us we’re not sure how—or why—one would invest without thinking about these broad themes and factoring the implications of this change into their thinking further while we understand that rapid change can be unsettling the hidden truth in these changes is that the human condition continues to improve yes we know the news media sometimes offers a steady drumbeat of negative news and we acknowledge that there are some very serious issues confronting us  we also acknowledge that for a large portion of the world life is nothing short of terrible we’ve always had serious problems to tackle and there has always been a large portion of the world for which life is extreme  yet despite the negative drumbeat the human condition continues to improve  how do we know almost any measure of the human condition is on an upward arc  infant mortality rates life expectancy leisure time per capita gdp

fund dividends  guinness atkinson funds dividends  guinness atkinson funds dividends the only thing we like better than dividends is growing dividends the fact that dividends have the ability to grow over time is an important benefit to investors seeking to keep pace with inflation and can be a key to enhancing the quality of life  our dividend strategy explicitly seeks a rising dividend stream

dividends energy innovation dividends are a key component to long term total returns from  to   of the total return of the sp  was from dividends one of the benefits of dividends is that they have the ability to grow over time which can help offset the effects of inflation and low or rising interest rate environment and who doesn’t appreciate a growing income stream because we’re explicitly aiming for dividend growth we focus on high quality companies the idea of investing in high quality companies sounds nice who doesn’t want high quality companies in their portfolio but it isn’t just a vague concept or slogan we have developed an investment methodology that rigorously even ruthlessly identifies high quality companies to us high quality means companies that have demonstrated a longterm consistent ability to generate high levels of cash flow it is this demonstrated ability to generate relatively high levels of cash that allows companies to grow their dividend over time and as we’ve said the only thing we like better than dividends are growing dividends this fund manager beats stock indices by finding ‘the next big thing’ with staying power  marketwatch latest news dow    nasdaq

columnist most mutual fund managers are unable to beat stock indices so when a management team does so for many years we want to know about it before we dig into the guinness atkinson global innovators fund let’s recall mark hulbert’s discussion about how awful active managers’ track records have been when measured against the sp  index spx  “over the last  years  of largecap funds lagged a simple sp  fund” marketwatch’s hulbert said as its name implies the guinness atkinson global innovators fund iwirx  aims for growth by investing in companies with competitive edges that translate into high returns on capital “we think innovation can be applied across industries” comanager matthew page said in an interview may  “you have disruptive companies but also companies that sustain themselves through innovation and also continuous innovators” he has been managing the fund with ian mortimer since  and worked as the fund’s analyst before that starting in  the fund’s benchmark is the msci world index but morningstar which ranks the fund four of five stars measures its performance against the sp  here’s how it has performed against both indices total return   through may

morningstar the fund’s average performance has outperformed both by significant margins for three five  and  years putting it in exclusive company page said the fund is about  overweight us stocks relative to the msci world index here’s the fund’s geographic breakdown as of march  page said that for the managers of the fund “innovation” can mean a new product or service “technical or scientific  a new chip or drug” but he also looks for innovative or disruptive business models “the likes of netflix nflx   or uber” then the fund managers dig into a company’s numbers to see if they point to strong longterm financial performance a hot new technological service or product may not mean there is a solid investment to be had he said d printing is an example saying he expects continual rapid growth for the industry still “the companies that were available to invest in in that area were not high quality” he said guinness atkinson funds matthew page comanager of the guinness atkinson global innovators fund “so our edge is not trying to predict the next big thing but trying to find the next entry point for companies — finding out which are hype cycles and which are good investments” he

and appliances and the increased use of robots recent purchase decisions have leaned toward asia but page stressed “we are very much bottomup stock pickers” meaning the managers are more focused on individual companies’ attributes not geographic regions “so this is not a broad view of asia but a lot of what makes asia cheap is the valuations of banks and financial companies which make up a lot of the benchmark” he said “so it was a combination of asia stocks looking cheap and these companies’ valuations giving us good starting points we have subsequently seen a rerating i would not necessarily bang on the table to buy more at this point in time but i am sort of happy with what we’ve got at the moment” he was referring to catcher technology co ltd   of taiwan the fund’s most recently purchased holding and aac technologies holdings inc    of shenzhen china those stocks were picked up at “attractive valuations” page said because of concern over apple iphone sales both are suppliers of components to apple inc aapl  and to other smartphone makers with shares of apple returning  this year through may  while catcher is up  and aac is up  he said he would “actually be trimming them back at these levels” if there were new money to invest but it’s important to keep in mind how often concerns over apple as expressed in breathless media headlines have pushed down its stock and shares of its suppliers there may be another period of attractive entry points for these stocks catcher makes unibody aluminum cases for apple’s  macbook air and macbook pro page said that in this niche the company has “sufficient scale that no other competitor can really compete with them the key is aluminum technology and using robots to mill out singlepiece casings” page added that catcher “buys robots from fanuc corp   a japanese company which we also own in the portfolio it is one of the leading robotics companies in the world” aac technologies represents “another bit of the apple supply chain” page said the company makes acoustic components including headphones and also haptic components which provide vibration feedback to the user and taptic components which are touchsensitive a big concern for apple is increasing competition from lowercost asian smartphone manufacturers but page said these companies would also be wellpositioned to supply them still worthy of buying when asked to name a company whose stock is still valued low enough that he would consider building the fund’s position page mentioned infineon technologies ag ifx   of munich the company has “a very significant edge on their competitors with some momentum with their earnings results” the company makes automotive semiconductor components and with the development of adaptive cruise control entertainment systems and automation “there is more and more silicon going into these cars” page said “if you look forward electric vehicles are likely to become a more significant portion of the

factors section in the prospectus before investing the value of the funds’ portfolios changes daily in accordance with the movement of underlying capital markets and the specific share price movements of the companies in whose shares each fund invests past performance is not a guide to future performance performance risks we identify the following performance risks in our funds market risk the value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and are not guaranteed an investor may not get back the amount originally invested the value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions other political social and economic developments as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each fund invests currency risk changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down while the funds have share classes priced in various currencies the base currency of all the funds is us dollars and the fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in us dollars nonus dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the us dollar valuation the funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency guinness asset management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the funds’ capital value or income the funds aim to be fully invested most of the time but any cash balances are normally held in us dollars this means that the exposure of the funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency therefore as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each fund holds the capital value of an investment in a fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local currency the fund’s base currency usd and the currency of the fund share class you own emerging market risk the risk inherent in a fund is higher when it is invested in markets which may be considered ’emerging’ these funds are only suitable for those investors who are prepared to accept the above average volatility inherent in

and guinness global money managers fund should note that all or part of the fees and expenses can be charged to the capital of the funds charging fees and expenses to capital has the effect of lowering the capital value of your investment fund specific risks in addition some funds carry their own specific risks sector risk some funds invest only in companies involved in a single industry or a single sector of the market these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one industry or sector and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness alternative energy fund guinness global energy fund guinness global money managers fund geographic risk some funds invest only in stocks listed in or exposed to one single country or region these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one country or region and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness china  hong kong fund for more detail on the risks relating to

higherrisk companies by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors eisqualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange or companies listed on the alternative investment market aim the guinness eis service is a discretionary managed service investing in eis qualifying companies and managed by guinness asset management ltd the investment manager the service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings” each offering has a finite subscription period with an opening and closing date for subscriptions to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years each offering has its own information memorandum detailing the terms and conditions specific risks and tax implications of investment the range of investment themes in the guinness eis service include aimlisted companies and sustainable energy companies an investment in the guinness eis service is subject to a number of risks both general and specific to each offering within the service before making any decision to invest prospective investors need to understand that investing in eisqualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk the information memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the information memorandum and their personal circumstances before investing investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser we recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing past performance of the investment manager is no guarantee of future performance the value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested the investment manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors there is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the investment manager general eis investment risks  concentration risk the investment manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies if sufficient investments are not made the returns achieved by the service could be materially impacted the investment manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company however there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors in these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector  size and liquidity risk the guinness eis service invests in companies that are relatively small smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute in particular there may be changes to the eis legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected some companies’ shares in which the investment manager invests will be listed on aim other companies will be unlisted listed shares although some companies’ shares in which the guinness eis service can invest are listed on aim not all shares are readily realisable at all times investment in shares traded on aim involves a higher degree of risk and such shares may be less liquid than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the rules governing aim companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the market price of aimlisted shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value the share price of aimlisted companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid the price at which aimlisted shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations and others which may affect aimlisted companies generally such as legislative changes and general economic political regulatory or social conditions some aimlisted companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders unlisted shares some offerings in the guinness eis service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation therefore there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering which is normally at least three years investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise the timing of realisations of investments by the service cannot therefore be predicted  tax risks the tax reliefs referred to in the information memorandum for each offering in the guinness eis service are those currently applicable however investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the service it is the intention of the investment manager to invest in companies which qualify under the eis legislation but there is no guarantee that eis status can be maintained throughout the life of the investment both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the eis legislation in order to maintain eis income tax relief cgt free disposal and cgt deferral relief and noncompliance may result in the loss or partial clawback of eis income tax relief and cgt deferral relief and potential interest penalties subscription funds will not be returned in these instances investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the investment manager shares in companies which qualify under the eis legislation will normally qualify for business property relief for inheritance tax purposes in order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years the investment manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for eis relief cgt deferral relief and business property relief although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment it is the intention of the investment manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years however the investment manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors specific eis risks additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the service and the companies in which it invests these specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies investors should

awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the
