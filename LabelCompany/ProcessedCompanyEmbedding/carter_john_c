presence immediately attacks him with a knife carter kills him but accidentally activates the therns powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of barsoom later

is captured by the tharks a clan of fourarmed green martians led by their jeddak chieftain tars tarkas tars instructs his loyal follower sola to watch over carter leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the martians language elsewhere on barsoom the human red martian city of helium led by thardos mors and the walking city of zodanga led by the villainous sab than dominic west have been at war for a thousand years sab than who wants to conquer all barsoom is armed with a special and highly destructive weapon given him by three therns in the midst of a shiptoship close quarters combat which the weapon ends by annihilating all the other participants than then proposes a ceasefire with helium and an end to the war sealed by marriage to mors daughter the princess of helium dejah thoris the unwilling princess disguised as a soldier escapes in a helium ship as tarkas tries to get carter to show off his jumping abilities a thark sentry spots a ship from helium and another from zodanga and the tharks scatter to hide carter races into action and leaps to save dejah from falling he kills some zodangan soldiers and briefly fights with than thans ship retreats and carter is hailed by tarkas as dotar sojat roughly translatable as my right arms for his strength and skill tarkas even grants him dejah as part of the thark spoils later carter accompanied by dejah tries to find a way to get back to earth and stumbles upon a temple ruin sacred to the tharks sola encounters them there and vainly tries to stop them from entering they discover an inscription depicting a way to earth in the sacred river of iss before carter dejah and sola are caught by tarkas rivals sarkoja and tal hajus the three are sentenced to death according to the thark code but are helped to escape by tarkas who reveals to carter that sola is his daughter hajus and sarkoja find the prisoners gone and the ambitious hajus declares that tarkas has betrayed them carter dejah sola and woola a calot  a large creature that resembles an amphibian and behaves like a loyal dog embark on a quest to the end of the sacred river to find a way home for carter they discover clues to the ninth ray a means of accessing infinite energy and the key to understanding how the medallion works they are attacked by the green martian clan of warhoon who have been manipulated by matai shang the leader of the therns to pursue them as part of thans latest plan after initially fleeing carter sends the others away and takes a stand fighting the horde himself as

that than had come alone and had organized the rescue party dejah reluctantly agrees to marry than and carter is taken to zodanga to be healed upon awakening carter is led to dejahs room dejah sends the servant girls away and gives carter his medallion telling him to return to earth as dejah leaves with than carter is met by shang who takes carter prisoner and walks him around zodanga in different zodangan forms shang explains to carter the therns purpose how they manipulate the civilizations of various planets into selfdestruction he also reveals thans secret plan to kill dejah once he marries her and to destroy helium and rule barsoom so completing the course the therns have set for the planet shang also reveals that he and the therns had been doing this for millions of years and implies that earth is their next target carter escapes thanks to woola and he and sola return to the tharks to request their help there they discover hajus has overthrown tarkas tarkas carter and sola are thrown into an arena to be killed by two enormous fourarmed great white apes carter defeats them and then challenges and easily kills hajus so becoming jeddak of the tharks carter and his thark army charge on helium and defeat the zodangan army in a huge battle while than is killed by shang before revealing anything more about the therns to carter shang then escapes in the chaos of the battle dejah and carter marry and he becomes prince of helium on their first night carter decides to stay on mars forever and throws away his medallion seizing this opportunity shang in the form of a helium guard sends him back to earth trapping him there and away from mars back on earth carter concludes that there may be other thern waystations like the spider cave of gold and embarks on a long quest for clues of the therns presence on earth and hoping to find one of their medallions after ten years he appears to die suddenly and requests his unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion since his return to mars would leave his earth body vulnerable in a comalike state he leaves burroughs clues about opening the tomb the film reverts to the original timeline burroughs races to carters tomb and opens it expecting to find carters body a thern in the form of a man with a bowler hat who has been shadowing carter for some time appears behind burroughs holding a weapon with which to destroy the body both are taken aback to see the tomb empty a shot rings out and the thern drops dead carter emerges and confesses to burroughs that he never found a medallion instead he had devised a scheme to lure a thern in order to get its medallion carter reiterates to burroughs that his body on earth needs protecting and recommends that burroughs enjoy his life on earth to fall in love and to write books he then takes the therns medallion whispers the code and is transported back to barsoom and dejah castedit taylor kitsch as john carter lynn collins as

interplanetary hero john carter and in later volumes the adventures of his children with dejah thoris the story was originally serialized in six monthly installments from february through to july  in the pulp magazine the allstory those chapters originally titled under the moons of mars were then collected in hardcover five years later from publisher a c mcclurg bob clampett involvementedit cover of the first edition of a princess of mars by burroughs mcclurg in  looney tunes director bob clampett approached edgar rice burroughs with the idea of adapting a princess of mars into a featurelength animated film burroughs responded enthusiastically recognizing that a regular liveaction feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately so he advised clampett to write an original animated adventure for john carter working with burroughs son john coleman burroughs in  clampett used rotoscope and other handdrawn techniques to capture the action tracing the motions of an athlete who performed john carters powerful movements in the reduced martian gravity and designed the greenskinned armed tharks to give them a believable appearance he then produced footage of them riding their eightlegged thoats at a gallop which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a martian volcano mgm was to release the cartoons and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series the test footage produced by  received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the us especially in small towns many gave their opinion that the concept of an earthman on mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern american audiences to accept the series was not given the goahead and clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated tarzan series an offer that he later declined clampett recognized the irony in mgms decision as the flash gordon movie serial released in the same year by universal studios was highly successful he speculated that mgm believed that serials were only played to children during saturday matinees whereas the john carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening the footage that clampett produced was believed lost for many years until burroughs grandson danton burroughs in the early s found some of the film tests in the edgar rice burroughs inc archives had a princess of mars been released it might have preceded walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs to become the first american featurelength animated film disney progressionedit during the late s famed stopmotion animation effects director ray harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels but it was not until the s that producers mario kassar and andrew g vajna bought the rights for walt disney studios with a view to creating a competitor to star wars and conan the barbarian ted elliott and terry rossio were hired to write while john mctiernan and tom cruise were approached to direct and star the project collapsed because mctiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate burroughs vision of barsoom the project remained at disney and jeffrey katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels but the rights eventually returned to the burroughs estate paramount effortedit producer james jacks read harry knowles autobiography which lavishly praised the john carter of mars series having read the burroughs novels as a child jacks was moved to convince paramount pictures to acquire the film rights a bidding war with columbia pictures followed after paramount and jacks won the rights jacks contacted knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired mark protosevich to write the screenplay robert rodriguez signed on in  to direct the film after his friend knowles showed him the script recognizing that knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer filming was set to begin in  with rodriguez planning to use the alldigital stages he was using for his production of sin city a film based on the graphic novel series by frank miller rodriguez planned to hire frank frazetta the popular burroughs and fantasy illustrator as a designer on the film rodriguez had previously stirredup film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit sin citys artistcreator frank miller as codirector on the film adaptation as a result of all the hoopla rodriguez decided to resign from the directors guild of america in  unable to employ a nondga filmmaker paramount assigned kerry conran to direct and ehren kruger to rewrite the john carter script the australian outback was scouted as a shooting location conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in october  by jon favreau favreau and screenwriter mark fergus wanted to make their script faithful to burroughs novels retaining john carters links to the american civil war and ensuring that the barsoomian tharks were  feet tall previous scripts had made them humansized favreau argued that a modernday soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like carter who had been a confederate officer the first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the barsoom series a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars unlike rodriguez and conran favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited planet of the apes as his inspiration he intended to use makeup as well as cgi to create the tharks in august  paramount chose not to renew the film rights preferring instead to focus on its star trek franchise favreau and fergus moved on to marvel studios iron man return to disney stanton involvementedit andrew stanton director of the pixar animation studios hits finding nemo  and walle  lobbied the walt disney studios to reacquire the rights from burroughs estate since id read the books as a kid i wanted to see somebody put it on the screen he explained he then lobbied disney heavily for the chance to direct the film pitching it as indiana jones on mars the studio was initially skeptical he had never directed a liveaction film before and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience at least on opening weekend the screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow but since stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make walle and finding nemo into hits the studio approved him as director stanton noted he was effectively being loaned to walt disney pictures because pixar is an allages brand and john carter in his words was not going to be an allages film by  they completed the first draft for part one of a john carter film trilogy the first film is based only on the first novel in april  author michael chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script following the completion of walle stanton visited the archives of edgar rice burroughs inc in tarzana california as part of his research jim morris general manager of pixar said the film would have a unique look that is distinct from frank frazettas illustrations which they both found dated he also noted that although he had less time for preproduction than for any of his usual animated projects the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read burroughs novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes productionedit filmingedit on john carter stanton was crafting a complicated interplanetary story with live action period elements and more than  visualeffects shots delivered by four companies the director said he coaxed disney to adopt some of pixars iterative style  —columnists dawn c chmielewski and rebecca keegan writing in the los angeles times principal photography commenced at longcross studios london in january  and ended in kanab utah in july  locations in utah included lake powell and the counties of grand wayne and kane a monthlong reshoot took place in playa vista los angeles the film was shot in the panavision anamorphic format on kodak  mm film stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time however he did admit to reshooting much of the movie twice far more than is usually common in live action filmmaking he attributed that to his animation background the thing i had to explain to disney was youre asking a guy whos only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot he explained later i said im not gonna get it right the first time ill tell you that right now stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at pixar on animated films known as the braintrust instead of those with liveaction experience working with him stanton also was quoted as saying i said to my producers ‘is it just me or do we actually know how to do this better than liveaction crews do’ rich ross disneys chairman successor to dick cook who had originally approved the film for production came from a television background and had no experience with feature films the studios new top marketing and production executives had little more marketingedit the head of walt disney studios marketing during the production was m t carney an industry outsider who previously ran a marketing boutique in new york stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio according to those who worked on the film stantons ideas were used instead and he ignored criticism that using led zeppelins  song kashmir in the trailer would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought he also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience stanton said “my joy when i saw the first trailer for star wars is i saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie and i had no idea how it connected and i had to go see the movie so the last thing i’m going to do is ruin that little kid’s experience” following the death of steve jobs stanton dedicated the film in his memory although being based on the first book of the series a princess of mars the film was originally titled john carter of mars but stanton removed of mars to make it more appealing to a broader audience stating that the film is an origin story its about a guy becoming john carter of mars stanton planned to keep mars in the title for future films in the series kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the characters journey as john carter would become of mars only in the last few minutes of the picture former disney marketing president carney has also taken blame for suggesting the title change another reported explanation for the name change was that disney had suffered a significant loss in march  with mars needs moms the studio reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word mars in the title had not been commercially successful earlier two and a half years before the premiere of the film on december   a lowbudget film produced by the independent film company the asylum entitled princess of mars was released directtodvd in the united states stanton has referred to the competing film as a crappy knockoff music and soundtrackedit

film it holds a  rating at the film review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on  reviews its consensus reads while john carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization at metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of  to critics reviews the film holds a score of  based on  reviews signifying mixed or average reviews todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter wrote derivative but charming and fun enough disneys mammoth scifier is both spectacular and a bit cheesy glenn kenny of msn movies rated the film  out of  stars saying by the end of the adventure even the initially befuddling doubleframe story pays off in spades for me this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that id willingly sit through a second or even third time roger ebert of the chicago suntimes rated the film  out of  stars commenting that the movie is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed does john carter get the job done for the weekend action audience yes i suppose it does dan jolin of empire gave the film  stars out of  noting stanton has built a fantastic world but the action is unmemorable still just about every scififantasysuperhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere joe neumaier of the new york daily news gave the film  out of  stars calling the film undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of but also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is in this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold  the movie is more western than science fiction even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value isnt it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at handtohand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with —roger ebert writing for the chicago suntimes conversely peter debruge of variety gave a negative review saying to watch john carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe stanton brought to finding nemo and walle owen glieberman of entertainment weekly gave the film a d rating feeling nothing in john carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better christy lemire of the boston globe wrote that except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor john carter is just a dreary convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computergenerated blippery converted to d michael philips of the chicago tribune rated the film  out of  stars saying the film isnt much – or rather its too much and not enough in weird clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur andrew oherir of saloncom called it a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels but if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence it’s also a riproaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second mick laselle of san francisco chronicle rated the film  star out of  noting john carter is a movie designed to be long epic and in d but thats as far as the design goes its designed to be a product and its a flimsy one ao scott of the new york times said john carter tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of bmovies pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines but it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic which buries the easy scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess a bad movie should not look this good in the uk the film was savaged by peter bradshaw in the guardian gaining only  star out of  and described as a giant suffocating doughy feast of boredom the film garnered  out of  stars in the daily telegraph described as a technical marvel but is also armrestclawingly hammy and painfully dated bbc film critic mark kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting the story telling is incomprehensible the characterisation is ludicrous the story is two and a quarter hours long and its a boring boring boring two and a quarter hours long box officeedit john carter earned  in north america and  in other countries for a worldwide total as of june  update of  it had a worldwide opening of  million in north america it opened in first place on friday march   with  million for three days it had grossed  million falling to second place for the weekend behind the lorax outside north america it topped the weekend chart opening with  million its highestgrossing opening was in russia and the cis where it broke the alltime openingday record  million and earned  million during the weekend the film also scored the secondbest opening weekend for a disney film in china  million it was in first place at the box office outside north america for two consecutive weekends its highestgrossing areas after north america are china  million russia and the cis  million and mexico  million although the film grossed nearly  million worldwide it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost at the time of its release disney claimed the films production budget was  million although tax returns released in  revealed its exact budget was  million after taking tax credits into account before the film opened analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant combined production and marketing costs of  million with paul dergarabedian president of hollywoodcom noting john carter’s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than  million to break evena height reached by only  films in the history of moviemaking on may   the walt disney company released a statement on its earnings which attributed the  million deterioration in the operating income of their studio entertainment division to a loss of  million in the quarter ending march  primarily to the performance of john carter and the associated cost writedown despite its moderate success at the boxoffice the film resulted in a  million writedown for disney ranking it among the biggest boxoffice bombs of alltime the films failure led to the resignation of rich ross the head of walt disney studios even though ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the disney channel with john carter already in development ross theoretically could have stopped production on john carter as he did with a planned remake of  leagues under the sea or minimized the budget as he did to the lone ranger starring johnny depp instead stanton was given the production budget requested for john carter backed with an estimated  million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tieins it was reported that ross later sought to blame pixar for john carter which prompted key pixar executives to turn against ross who already had alienated many within the studio the  book john carter and the gods of hollywood cites many factors in the films commercial failure but author michael d sellers insists the film tested very well with audiences and failed more because of marketing problems which included not mentioning mars barsoom or edgar rice burroughs on promotional posters which meant that many fans of the burroughs books were completely unaware of the film and its subject matter until after it bombed and changing management at the studio in september  studio president alan bergman was asked at a conference if disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on the lone ranger and john carter through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods and he responded im going to answer that question honestly and tell you no it didnt get that much better we did lose that much money on those movies accoladesedit

burroughs reads while prospecting in the arizona territory in  just after the civil war carter is arrested by union colonel powell who seeks his help in fighting the apache and insists that carter owes it to his country carter refuses stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by powell and his cavalry after encountering a band of apaches carter and the wounded powell take refuge in a cave which turns out to be the object of carters earlier search the spider cave of gold a mysterious priestly being a thern appears in the cave at that moment and surprised by carters presence immediately attacks him with a knife carter kills him but accidentally activates the therns powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of barsoom later revealed to be mars hundreds of millions of years in the past due to barsooms low gravity and his own relatively high bone density carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength he is captured by the tharks a clan of fourarmed green martians led by their jeddak chieftain tars tarkas tars instructs his loyal follower sola to watch over carter leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the martians language elsewhere on barsoom the human red martian city of helium led by thardos mors and the walking city of zodanga led by the villainous sab than dominic west have been at war for a thousand years sab than who wants to conquer all barsoom is armed with a special and highly destructive weapon given him by three therns in the midst of a shiptoship close quarters combat which the weapon ends by annihilating all the other participants than then proposes a ceasefire with helium and an end to the war sealed by marriage to mors daughter the princess of helium dejah thoris the unwilling princess disguised as a soldier escapes in a helium ship as tarkas tries to get carter to show off his jumping abilities a thark sentry spots a ship from helium and another from zodanga and the tharks scatter to hide carter races into action and leaps to save dejah from falling he kills some zodangan soldiers and briefly fights with than thans ship retreats and carter is hailed by tarkas as dotar sojat roughly translatable as my right arms for his strength and skill tarkas even grants him dejah as part of the thark spoils later carter accompanied by dejah tries to find a way to get back to earth and stumbles upon a temple ruin sacred to the tharks sola encounters them there and vainly tries to stop them from entering they discover an inscription depicting a way to earth in the sacred river of iss before carter dejah and sola are caught by tarkas rivals sarkoja and tal hajus the three are sentenced to death according to the thark code but are helped to escape by tarkas who reveals to carter that sola is his daughter hajus and sarkoja find the prisoners gone and the ambitious hajus declares that tarkas has betrayed them carter dejah sola and woola a calot  a large creature that resembles an amphibian and behaves like a loyal dog embark on a quest to the end of the sacred river to find a way home for carter they discover clues to the ninth ray a means of accessing infinite energy and the key to understanding how the medallion works they are attacked by the green martian clan of warhoon who have been manipulated by matai shang the leader of the therns to pursue them as part of thans latest plan after initially fleeing carter sends the others away and takes a stand fighting the horde himself as atonement for being unable to save his own family though defeating many warhoon carter is ultimately overpowered he is saved when mors intervenes in a helium ship than is also in the company mors says that than had come alone and had organized the rescue party dejah reluctantly agrees to marry than and carter is taken to zodanga to be healed upon awakening carter is led to dejahs room dejah sends the servant girls away and gives carter his medallion telling him to return to earth as dejah leaves with than carter is met by shang who takes carter prisoner and walks him around zodanga in different zodangan forms shang explains to carter the therns purpose how they manipulate the civilizations of various planets into selfdestruction he also reveals thans secret plan to kill dejah once he marries her and to destroy helium and rule barsoom so completing the course the therns have set for the planet shang also reveals that he and the therns had been doing this for millions of years and implies that earth is their next target carter escapes thanks to woola and he and sola return to the tharks to request their help there they discover hajus has overthrown tarkas tarkas carter and sola are thrown into an arena to be killed by two enormous fourarmed great white apes carter defeats them and then challenges and easily kills hajus so becoming jeddak of the tharks carter and his thark army charge on helium and defeat the zodangan army in a huge battle while than is killed by shang before revealing anything more about the therns to carter shang then escapes in the chaos of the battle dejah and carter marry and he becomes prince of helium on their first night carter decides to stay on mars forever and throws away his medallion seizing this opportunity shang in the form of a helium guard sends him back to earth trapping him there and away from mars back on earth carter concludes that there may be other thern waystations like the spider cave of gold and embarks on a long quest for clues of the therns presence on earth and hoping to find one of their medallions after ten years he appears to die suddenly and requests his unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion since his return to mars would leave his earth body vulnerable in a comalike state he leaves burroughs clues about opening the tomb the film reverts to the original timeline burroughs races to carters tomb and opens it expecting to find carters body a thern in the form of a man with a bowler hat who has been shadowing carter for some time appears behind burroughs holding a weapon with which to destroy the body both are taken aback to see the tomb empty a shot rings out and the thern drops dead carter emerges and confesses to burroughs that he never found a medallion instead he had devised a scheme to lure a thern in order to get its medallion carter reiterates to burroughs that his body on earth needs protecting and recommends that burroughs enjoy his life on earth to fall in love and to write books he then takes the therns medallion whispers the code and is transported back to barsoom and dejah castedit taylor kitsch as john carter lynn

the interplanetary hero john carter and in later volumes the adventures of his children with dejah thoris the story was originally serialized in six monthly installments from february through to july  in the pulp magazine the allstory those chapters originally titled under the moons of mars were then collected in hardcover five years later from publisher a c mcclurg bob clampett involvementedit cover of the first edition of a princess of mars by burroughs mcclurg in  looney tunes director bob clampett approached edgar rice burroughs with the idea of adapting a princess of mars into a featurelength animated film burroughs responded enthusiastically recognizing that a regular liveaction feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately so he advised clampett to write an original animated adventure for john carter working with burroughs son john coleman burroughs in  clampett used rotoscope and other handdrawn techniques to capture the action tracing the motions of an athlete who performed john carters powerful movements in the reduced martian gravity and designed the greenskinned armed tharks to give them a believable appearance he then produced footage of them riding their eightlegged thoats at a gallop which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a martian volcano mgm was to release the cartoons and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series the test footage produced by  received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the us especially in small towns many gave their opinion that the concept of an earthman on mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern american audiences to accept the series was not given the goahead and clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated tarzan series an offer that he later declined clampett recognized the irony in mgms decision as the flash gordon movie serial released in the same year by universal studios was highly successful he speculated that mgm believed that serials were only played to children during saturday matinees whereas the john carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening the footage that clampett produced was believed lost for many years until burroughs grandson danton burroughs in the early s found some of the film tests in the edgar rice burroughs inc archives had a princess of mars been released it might have preceded walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs to become the first american featurelength animated film disney progressionedit during the late s famed stopmotion animation effects director ray harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels but it was not until the s that producers mario kassar and andrew g vajna bought the rights for walt disney studios with a view to creating a competitor to star wars and conan the barbarian ted elliott and terry rossio were hired to write while john mctiernan and tom cruise were approached to direct and star the project collapsed because mctiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate burroughs vision of barsoom the project remained at disney and jeffrey katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels but the rights eventually returned to the burroughs estate paramount effortedit producer james jacks read harry knowles autobiography which lavishly praised the john carter of mars series having read the burroughs novels as a child jacks was moved to convince paramount pictures to acquire the film rights a bidding war with columbia pictures followed after paramount and jacks won the rights jacks contacted knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired mark protosevich to write the screenplay robert rodriguez signed on in  to direct the film after his friend knowles showed him the script recognizing that knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer filming was set to begin in  with rodriguez planning to use the alldigital stages he was using for his production of sin city a film based on the graphic novel series by frank miller rodriguez planned to hire frank frazetta the popular burroughs and fantasy illustrator as a designer on the film rodriguez had previously stirredup film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit sin citys artistcreator frank miller as codirector on the film adaptation as a result of all the hoopla rodriguez decided to resign from the directors guild of america in  unable to employ a nondga filmmaker paramount assigned kerry conran to direct and ehren kruger to rewrite the john carter script the australian outback was scouted as a shooting location conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in october  by jon favreau favreau and screenwriter mark fergus wanted to make their script faithful to burroughs novels retaining john carters links to the american civil war and ensuring that the barsoomian tharks were  feet tall previous scripts had made them humansized favreau argued that a modernday soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like carter who had been a confederate officer the first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the barsoom series a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars unlike rodriguez and conran favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited planet of the apes as his inspiration he intended to use makeup as well as cgi to create the tharks in august  paramount chose not to renew the film rights preferring instead to focus on its star trek franchise favreau and fergus moved on to marvel studios iron man return to disney stanton involvementedit andrew stanton director of the pixar animation studios hits finding nemo  and walle  lobbied the walt disney studios to reacquire the rights from burroughs estate since id read the books as a kid i wanted to see somebody put it on the screen he explained he then lobbied disney heavily for the chance to direct the film pitching it as indiana jones on mars the studio was initially skeptical he had never directed a liveaction film before and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience at least on opening weekend the screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow but since stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make walle and finding nemo into hits the studio approved him as director stanton noted he was effectively being loaned to walt disney pictures because pixar is an allages brand and john carter in his words was not going to be an allages film by  they completed the first draft for part one of a john carter film trilogy the first film is based only on the first novel in april  author michael chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script following the completion of walle stanton visited the archives of edgar rice burroughs inc in tarzana california as part of his research jim morris general manager of pixar said the film would have a unique look that is distinct from frank frazettas illustrations which they both found dated he also noted that although he had less time for preproduction than for any of his usual animated projects the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read burroughs novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes productionedit filmingedit on john carter stanton was crafting a complicated interplanetary story with live action period elements and more than  visualeffects shots delivered by four companies the director said he coaxed disney to adopt some of pixars iterative style  —columnists dawn c chmielewski and rebecca keegan writing in the los angeles times principal photography commenced at longcross studios london in january  and ended in kanab utah in july  locations in utah included lake powell and the counties of grand wayne and kane a monthlong reshoot took place in playa vista los angeles the film was shot in the panavision anamorphic format on kodak  mm film stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time however he did admit to reshooting much of the movie twice far more than is usually common in live action filmmaking he attributed that to his animation background the thing i had to explain to disney was youre asking a guy whos only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot he explained later i said im not gonna get it right the first time ill tell you that right now stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at pixar on animated films known as the braintrust instead of those with liveaction experience working with him stanton also was quoted as saying i said to my producers ‘is it just me or do we actually know how to do this better than liveaction crews do’ rich ross disneys chairman successor to dick cook who had originally approved the film for production came from a television background and had no experience with feature films the studios new top marketing and production executives had little more marketingedit the head of walt disney studios marketing during the production was m t carney an industry outsider who previously ran a marketing boutique in new york stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio according to those who worked on the film stantons ideas were used instead and he ignored criticism that using led zeppelins  song kashmir in the trailer would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought he also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience stanton said “my joy when i saw the first trailer for star wars is i saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie and i had no idea how it connected and i had to go see the movie so the last thing i’m going to do is ruin that little kid’s experience” following the death of steve jobs stanton dedicated the film in his memory although being based on the first book of the series a princess of mars the film was originally titled john carter of mars but stanton removed of mars to make it more appealing to a broader audience stating that the film is an origin story its about a guy becoming john carter of mars stanton planned to keep mars in the title for future films in the series kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the characters journey as john carter would become of mars only in the last few minutes of the picture former disney marketing president carney has also taken blame for suggesting the title change another reported explanation for the name change was that disney had suffered a significant loss in march  with mars needs moms the studio reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word mars in the title had not been commercially successful earlier two and a half years before the premiere of the film on december   a lowbudget film produced by the independent film company the asylum entitled princess of mars was released directtodvd in the united states stanton has referred to the competing film as a crappy knockoff music and soundtrackedit

film it holds a  rating at the film review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on  reviews its consensus reads while john carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization at metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of  to critics reviews the film holds a score of  based on  reviews signifying mixed or average reviews todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter wrote derivative but charming and fun enough disneys mammoth scifier is both spectacular and a bit cheesy glenn kenny of msn movies rated the film  out of  stars saying by the end of the adventure even the initially befuddling doubleframe story pays off in spades for me this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that id willingly sit through a second or even third time roger ebert of the chicago suntimes rated the film  out of  stars commenting that the movie is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed does john carter get the job done for the weekend action audience yes i suppose it does dan jolin of empire gave the film  stars out of  noting stanton has built a fantastic world but the action is unmemorable still just about every scififantasysuperhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere joe neumaier of the new york daily news gave the film  out of  stars calling the film undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of but also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is in this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold  the movie is more western than science fiction even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value isnt it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at handtohand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with —roger ebert writing for the chicago suntimes conversely peter debruge of variety gave a negative review saying to watch john carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe stanton brought to finding nemo and walle owen glieberman of entertainment weekly gave the film a d rating feeling nothing in john carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better christy lemire of the boston globe wrote that except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor john carter is just a dreary convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computergenerated blippery converted to d michael philips of the chicago tribune rated the film  out of  stars saying the film isnt much – or rather its too much and not enough in weird clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur andrew oherir of saloncom called it a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels but if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence it’s also a riproaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second mick laselle of san francisco chronicle rated the film  star out of  noting john carter is a movie designed to be long epic and in d but thats as far as the design goes its designed to be a product and its a flimsy one ao scott of the new york times said john carter tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of bmovies pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines but it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic which buries the easy scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess a bad movie should not look this good in the uk the film was savaged by peter bradshaw in the guardian gaining only  star out of  and described as a giant suffocating doughy feast of boredom the film garnered  out of  stars in the daily telegraph described as a technical marvel but is also armrestclawingly hammy and painfully dated bbc film critic mark kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting the story telling is incomprehensible the characterisation is ludicrous the story is two and a quarter hours long and its a boring boring boring two and a quarter hours long box officeedit john carter earned  in north america and  in other countries for a worldwide total as of june  update of  it had a worldwide opening of  million in north america it opened in first place on friday march   with  million for three days it had grossed  million falling to second place for the weekend behind the lorax outside north america it topped the weekend chart opening with  million its highestgrossing opening was in russia and the cis where it broke the alltime openingday record  million and earned  million during the weekend the film also scored the secondbest opening weekend for a disney film in china  million it was in first place at the box office outside north america for two consecutive weekends its highestgrossing areas after north america are china  million russia and the cis  million and mexico  million although the film grossed nearly  million worldwide it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost at the time of its release disney claimed the films production budget was  million although tax returns released in  revealed its exact budget was  million after taking tax credits into account before the film opened analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant combined production and marketing costs of  million with paul dergarabedian president of hollywoodcom noting john carter’s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than  million to break evena height reached by only  films in the history of moviemaking on may   the walt disney company released a statement on its earnings which attributed the  million deterioration in the operating income of their studio entertainment division to a loss of  million in the quarter ending march  primarily to the performance of john carter and the associated cost writedown despite its moderate success at the boxoffice the film resulted in a  million writedown for disney ranking it among the biggest boxoffice bombs of alltime the films failure led to the resignation of rich ross the head of walt disney studios even though ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the disney channel with john carter already in development ross theoretically could have stopped production on john carter as he did with a planned remake of  leagues under the sea or minimized the budget as he did to the lone ranger starring johnny depp instead stanton was given the production budget requested for john carter backed with an estimated  million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tieins it was reported that ross later sought to blame pixar for john carter which prompted key pixar executives to turn against ross who already had alienated many within the studio the  book john carter and the gods of hollywood cites many factors in the films commercial failure but author michael d sellers insists the film tested very well with audiences and failed more because of marketing problems which included not mentioning mars barsoom or edgar rice burroughs on promotional posters which meant that many fans of the burroughs books were completely unaware of the film and its subject matter until after it bombed and changing management at the studio in september  studio president alan bergman was asked at a conference if disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on the lone ranger and john carter through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods and he responded im going to answer that question honestly and tell you no it didnt get that much better we did lose that much money on those movies accoladesedit

owes it to his country carter refuses stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by powell and his cavalry after encountering a band of apaches carter and the wounded powell take refuge in a cave which turns out to be the object of carters earlier search the spider cave of gold a mysterious priestly being a thern appears in the cave at that moment and surprised by carters presence immediately attacks him with a knife carter kills him but accidentally activates the therns powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of barsoom later revealed to be mars hundreds of millions of years in the past due to barsooms low gravity and his own relatively high bone density carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength he is captured by the tharks a clan of fourarmed green martians led by their jeddak chieftain tars tarkas tars instructs his loyal follower sola to watch over carter leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the martians language elsewhere on barsoom the human red martian city of helium led by thardos mors and the walking city of zodanga led by the villainous sab than dominic west have been at war for a thousand years sab than who wants to conquer all barsoom is armed with a special and highly destructive weapon given him by three therns in the midst of a shiptoship close quarters combat which the weapon ends by annihilating all the other participants than then proposes a ceasefire with helium and an end to the war sealed by marriage to mors daughter the princess of helium dejah thoris the unwilling princess disguised as a soldier escapes in a helium ship as tarkas tries to get carter to show off his jumping abilities a thark sentry spots a ship from helium and another from zodanga and the tharks scatter to hide carter races into action and leaps to save dejah from falling he kills some zodangan soldiers and briefly fights with than thans ship retreats and carter is hailed by tarkas as dotar sojat roughly translatable as my right arms for his strength and skill tarkas even grants him dejah as part of the thark spoils later carter accompanied by dejah tries to find a way to get back to earth and stumbles upon a temple ruin sacred to the tharks sola encounters them there and vainly tries to stop them from entering they discover an inscription depicting a way to earth in the sacred river of iss before carter dejah and sola are caught by tarkas rivals sarkoja and tal hajus the three are sentenced to death according to the thark code but are helped to escape by tarkas who reveals to carter that sola is his daughter hajus and sarkoja find the prisoners gone and the ambitious hajus declares that tarkas has betrayed them carter dejah sola and woola a calot  a large creature that resembles an amphibian and behaves like a loyal dog embark on a quest to the end of the sacred river to find a way home for carter they discover clues to the ninth ray a means of accessing infinite energy and the key to understanding how the medallion works they are attacked by the green martian clan of warhoon who have been manipulated by matai shang the leader of the therns to pursue them as part of thans latest plan after initially fleeing carter sends the others away and takes a stand fighting the horde himself as atonement for being unable to save his own family though defeating many warhoon carter is ultimately overpowered he is saved when mors intervenes in a helium ship than is also in the company mors says that than had come alone and had organized the rescue party dejah reluctantly agrees to marry than and carter is taken to zodanga to be healed upon awakening carter is led to dejahs room dejah sends the servant girls away and gives carter his medallion telling him to return to earth as dejah leaves with than carter is met by shang who takes carter prisoner and walks him around zodanga in different zodangan forms shang explains to carter the therns purpose how they manipulate the civilizations of various planets into selfdestruction he also reveals thans secret plan to kill dejah once he marries her and to destroy helium and rule barsoom so completing the course the therns have set for the planet shang also reveals that he and the therns had been doing this for millions of years and implies that earth is their next target carter escapes thanks to woola and he and sola return to the tharks to request their help there they discover hajus has overthrown tarkas tarkas carter and sola are thrown into an arena to be killed by two enormous fourarmed great white apes carter defeats them and then challenges and easily kills hajus so becoming jeddak of the tharks carter and his thark army charge on helium and defeat the zodangan army in a huge battle while than is killed by shang before revealing anything more about the therns to carter shang then escapes in the chaos of the battle dejah and carter marry and he becomes prince of helium on their first night carter decides to stay on mars forever and throws away his medallion seizing this opportunity shang in the form of a helium guard sends him back to earth trapping him there and away from mars back on earth carter concludes that there may be other thern waystations like the spider cave of gold and embarks on a long quest for clues of the therns presence on earth and hoping to find one of their medallions after ten years he appears to die suddenly and requests his unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion since his return to mars would leave his earth body vulnerable in a comalike state he leaves burroughs clues about opening the tomb the film reverts to the original timeline burroughs races to carters tomb and opens it expecting to find carters body a thern in the form of a man with a bowler hat who has been shadowing carter for some time appears behind burroughs holding a weapon with which to destroy the body both are taken aback to see the tomb empty a shot rings out and the thern drops dead carter emerges and confesses to burroughs that he never found a medallion instead he had devised a scheme to lure a thern in order to get its medallion carter reiterates to burroughs that his body on earth needs protecting and recommends that burroughs enjoy his life on earth to fall in love and to write books he then takes the therns medallion whispers the code and is transported back to barsoom and dejah castedit taylor kitsch as john carter lynn

the interplanetary hero john carter and in later volumes the adventures of his children with dejah thoris the story was originally serialized in six monthly installments from february through to july  in the pulp magazine the allstory those chapters originally titled under the moons of mars were then collected in hardcover five years later from publisher a c mcclurg bob clampett involvementedit cover of the first edition of a princess of mars by burroughs mcclurg in  looney tunes director bob clampett approached edgar rice burroughs with the idea of adapting a princess of mars into a featurelength animated film burroughs responded enthusiastically recognizing that a regular liveaction feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately so he advised clampett to write an original animated adventure for john carter working with burroughs son john coleman burroughs in  clampett used rotoscope and other handdrawn techniques to capture the action tracing the motions of an athlete who performed john carters powerful movements in the reduced martian gravity and designed the greenskinned armed tharks to give them a believable appearance he then produced footage of them riding their eightlegged thoats at a gallop which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a martian volcano mgm was to release the cartoons and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series the test footage produced by  received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the us especially in small towns many gave their opinion that the concept of an earthman on mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern american audiences to accept the series was not given the goahead and clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated tarzan series an offer that he later declined clampett recognized the irony in mgms decision as the flash gordon movie serial released in the same year by universal studios was highly successful he speculated that mgm believed that serials were only played to children during saturday matinees whereas the john carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening the footage that clampett produced was believed lost for many years until burroughs grandson danton burroughs in the early s found some of the film tests in the edgar rice burroughs inc archives had a princess of mars been released it might have preceded walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs to become the first american featurelength animated film disney progressionedit during the late s famed stopmotion animation effects director ray harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels but it was not until the s that producers mario kassar and andrew g vajna bought the rights for walt disney studios with a view to creating a competitor to star wars and conan the barbarian ted elliott and terry rossio were hired to write while john mctiernan and tom cruise were approached to direct and star the project collapsed because mctiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate burroughs vision of barsoom the project remained at disney and jeffrey katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels but the rights eventually returned to the burroughs estate paramount effortedit producer james jacks read harry knowles autobiography which lavishly praised the john carter of mars series having read the burroughs novels as a child jacks was moved to convince paramount pictures to acquire the film rights a bidding war with columbia pictures followed after paramount and jacks won the rights jacks contacted knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired mark protosevich to write the screenplay robert rodriguez signed on in  to direct the film after his friend knowles showed him the script recognizing that knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer filming was set to begin in  with rodriguez planning to use the alldigital stages he was using for his production of sin city a film based on the graphic novel series by frank miller rodriguez planned to hire frank frazetta the popular burroughs and fantasy illustrator as a designer on the film rodriguez had previously stirredup film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit sin citys artistcreator frank miller as codirector on the film adaptation as a result of all the hoopla rodriguez decided to resign from the directors guild of america in  unable to employ a nondga filmmaker paramount assigned kerry conran to direct and ehren kruger to rewrite the john carter script the australian outback was scouted as a shooting location conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in october  by jon favreau favreau and screenwriter mark fergus wanted to make their script faithful to burroughs novels retaining john carters links to the american civil war and ensuring that the barsoomian tharks were  feet tall previous scripts had made them humansized favreau argued that a modernday soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like carter who had been a confederate officer the first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the barsoom series a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars unlike rodriguez and conran favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited planet of the apes as his inspiration he intended to use makeup as well as cgi to create the tharks in august  paramount chose not to renew the film rights preferring instead to focus on its star trek franchise favreau and fergus moved on to marvel studios iron man return to disney stanton involvementedit andrew stanton director of the pixar animation studios hits finding nemo  and walle  lobbied the walt disney studios to reacquire the rights from burroughs estate since id read the books as a kid i wanted to see somebody put it on the screen he explained he then lobbied disney heavily for the chance to direct the film pitching it as indiana jones on mars the studio was initially skeptical he had never directed a liveaction film before and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience at least on opening weekend the screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow but since stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make walle and finding nemo into hits the studio approved him as director stanton noted he was effectively being loaned to walt disney pictures because pixar is an allages brand and john carter in his words was not going to be an allages film by  they completed the first draft for part one of a john carter film trilogy the first film is based only on the first novel in april  author michael chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script following the completion of walle stanton visited the archives of edgar rice burroughs inc in tarzana california as part of his research jim morris general manager of pixar said the film would have a unique look that is distinct from frank frazettas illustrations which they both found dated he also noted that although he had less time for preproduction than for any of his usual animated projects the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read burroughs novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes productionedit filmingedit on john carter stanton was crafting a complicated interplanetary story with live action period elements and more than  visualeffects shots delivered by four companies the director said he coaxed disney to adopt some of pixars iterative style  —columnists dawn c chmielewski and rebecca keegan writing in the los angeles times principal photography commenced at longcross studios london in january  and ended in kanab utah in july  locations in utah included lake powell and the counties of grand wayne and kane a monthlong reshoot took place in playa vista los angeles the film was shot in the panavision anamorphic format on kodak  mm film stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time however he did admit to reshooting much of the movie twice far more than is usually common in live action filmmaking he attributed that to his animation background the thing i had to explain to disney was youre asking a guy whos only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot he explained later i said im not gonna get it right the first time ill tell you that right now stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at pixar on animated films known as the braintrust instead of those with liveaction experience working with him stanton also was quoted as saying i said to my producers ‘is it just me or do we actually know how to do this better than liveaction crews do’ rich ross disneys chairman successor to dick cook who had originally approved the film for production came from a television background and had no experience with feature films the studios new top marketing and production executives had little more marketingedit the head of walt disney studios marketing during the production was m t carney an industry outsider who previously ran a marketing boutique in new york stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio according to those who worked on the film stantons ideas were used instead and he ignored criticism that using led zeppelins  song kashmir in the trailer would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought he also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience stanton said “my joy when i saw the first trailer for star wars is i saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie and i had no idea how it connected and i had to go see the movie so the last thing i’m going to do is ruin that little kid’s experience” following the death of steve jobs stanton dedicated the film in his memory although being based on the first book of the series a princess of mars the film was originally titled john carter of mars but stanton removed of mars to make it more appealing to a broader audience stating that the film is an origin story its about a guy becoming john carter of mars stanton planned to keep mars in the title for future films in the series kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the characters journey as john carter would become of mars only in the last few minutes of the picture former disney marketing president carney has also taken blame for suggesting the title change another reported explanation for the name change was that disney had suffered a significant loss in march  with mars needs moms the studio reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word mars in the title had not been commercially successful earlier two and a half years before the premiere of the film on december   a lowbudget film produced by the independent film company the asylum entitled princess of mars was released directtodvd in the united states stanton has referred to the competing film as a crappy knockoff music and soundtrackedit

film it holds a  rating at the film review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on  reviews its consensus reads while john carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization at metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of  to critics reviews the film holds a score of  based on  reviews signifying mixed or average reviews todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter wrote derivative but charming and fun enough disneys mammoth scifier is both spectacular and a bit cheesy glenn kenny of msn movies rated the film  out of  stars saying by the end of the adventure even the initially befuddling doubleframe story pays off in spades for me this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that id willingly sit through a second or even third time roger ebert of the chicago suntimes rated the film  out of  stars commenting that the movie is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed does john carter get the job done for the weekend action audience yes i suppose it does dan jolin of empire gave the film  stars out of  noting stanton has built a fantastic world but the action is unmemorable still just about every scififantasysuperhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere joe neumaier of the new york daily news gave the film  out of  stars calling the film undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of but also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is in this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold  the movie is more western than science fiction even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value isnt it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at handtohand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with —roger ebert writing for the chicago suntimes conversely peter debruge of variety gave a negative review saying to watch john carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe stanton brought to finding nemo and walle owen glieberman of entertainment weekly gave the film a d rating feeling nothing in john carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better christy lemire of the boston globe wrote that except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor john carter is just a dreary convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computergenerated blippery converted to d michael philips of the chicago tribune rated the film  out of  stars saying the film isnt much – or rather its too much and not enough in weird clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur andrew oherir of saloncom called it a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels but if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence it’s also a riproaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second mick laselle of san francisco chronicle rated the film  star out of  noting john carter is a movie designed to be long epic and in d but thats as far as the design goes its designed to be a product and its a flimsy one ao scott of the new york times said john carter tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of bmovies pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines but it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic which buries the easy scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess a bad movie should not look this good in the uk the film was savaged by peter bradshaw in the guardian gaining only  star out of  and described as a giant suffocating doughy feast of boredom the film garnered  out of  stars in the daily telegraph described as a technical marvel but is also armrestclawingly hammy and painfully dated bbc film critic mark kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting the story telling is incomprehensible the characterisation is ludicrous the story is two and a quarter hours long and its a boring boring boring two and a quarter hours long box officeedit john carter earned  in north america and  in other countries for a worldwide total as of june  update of  it had a worldwide opening of  million in north america it opened in first place on friday march   with  million for three days it had grossed  million falling to second place for the weekend behind the lorax outside north america it topped the weekend chart opening with  million its highestgrossing opening was in russia and the cis where it broke the alltime openingday record  million and earned  million during the weekend the film also scored the secondbest opening weekend for a disney film in china  million it was in first place at the box office outside north america for two consecutive weekends its highestgrossing areas after north america are china  million russia and the cis  million and mexico  million although the film grossed nearly  million worldwide it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost at the time of its release disney claimed the films production budget was  million although tax returns released in  revealed its exact budget was  million after taking tax credits into account before the film opened analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant combined production and marketing costs of  million with paul dergarabedian president of hollywoodcom noting john carter’s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than  million to break evena height reached by only  films in the history of moviemaking on may   the walt disney company released a statement on its earnings which attributed the  million deterioration in the operating income of their studio entertainment division to a loss of  million in the quarter ending march  primarily to the performance of john carter and the associated cost writedown despite its moderate success at the boxoffice the film resulted in a  million writedown for disney ranking it among the biggest boxoffice bombs of alltime the films failure led to the resignation of rich ross the head of walt disney studios even though ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the disney channel with john carter already in development ross theoretically could have stopped production on john carter as he did with a planned remake of  leagues under the sea or minimized the budget as he did to the lone ranger starring johnny depp instead stanton was given the production budget requested for john carter backed with an estimated  million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tieins it was reported that ross later sought to blame pixar for john carter which prompted key pixar executives to turn against ross who already had alienated many within the studio the  book john carter and the gods of hollywood cites many factors in the films commercial failure but author michael d sellers insists the film tested very well with audiences and failed more because of marketing problems which included not mentioning mars barsoom or edgar rice burroughs on promotional posters which meant that many fans of the burroughs books were completely unaware of the film and its subject matter until after it bombed and changing management at the studio in september  studio president alan bergman was asked at a conference if disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on the lone ranger and john carter through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods and he responded im going to answer that question honestly and tell you no it didnt get that much better we did lose that much money on those movies accoladesedit

owes it to his country carter refuses stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by powell and his cavalry after encountering a band of apaches carter and the wounded powell take refuge in a cave which turns out to be the object of carters earlier search the spider cave of gold a mysterious priestly being a thern appears in the cave at that moment and surprised by carters presence immediately attacks him with a knife carter kills him but accidentally activates the therns powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of barsoom later revealed to be mars hundreds of millions of years in the past due to barsooms low gravity and his own relatively high bone density carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength he is captured by the tharks a clan of fourarmed green martians led by their jeddak chieftain tars tarkas tars instructs his loyal follower sola to watch over carter leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the martians language elsewhere on barsoom the human red martian city of helium led by thardos mors and the walking city of zodanga led by the villainous sab than dominic west have been at war for a thousand years sab than who wants to conquer all barsoom is armed with a special and highly destructive weapon given him by three therns in the midst of a shiptoship close quarters combat which the weapon ends by annihilating all the other participants than then proposes a ceasefire with helium and an end to the war sealed by marriage to mors daughter the princess of helium dejah thoris the unwilling princess disguised as a soldier escapes in a helium ship as tarkas tries to get carter to show off his jumping abilities a thark sentry spots a ship from helium and another from zodanga and the tharks scatter to hide carter races into action and leaps to save dejah from falling he kills some zodangan soldiers and briefly fights with than thans ship retreats and carter is hailed by tarkas as dotar sojat roughly translatable as my right arms for his strength and skill tarkas even grants him dejah as part of the thark spoils later carter accompanied by dejah tries to find a way to get back to earth and stumbles upon a temple ruin sacred to the tharks sola encounters them there and vainly tries to stop them from entering they discover an inscription depicting a way to earth in the sacred river of iss before carter dejah and sola are caught by tarkas rivals sarkoja and tal hajus the three are sentenced to death according to the thark code but are helped to escape by tarkas who reveals to carter that sola is his daughter hajus and sarkoja find the prisoners gone and the ambitious hajus declares that

home for carter they discover clues to the ninth ray a means of accessing infinite energy and the key to understanding how the medallion works they are attacked by the green martian clan of warhoon who have been manipulated by matai shang the leader of the therns to pursue them as part of thans latest plan after initially fleeing carter sends the others away and takes a stand fighting the horde

and his thark army charge on helium and defeat the zodangan army in a huge battle while than is killed by shang before revealing anything more about the therns to carter shang then escapes in the chaos of the battle dejah and carter marry and he becomes prince of helium on their first night carter decides to stay on mars forever and throws away his medallion seizing this opportunity shang in the form of a helium guard sends him back to earth trapping him there and away from mars back on earth carter concludes that there may be other thern waystations like the spider cave of gold and embarks on a long quest for clues of the therns presence on earth and hoping to find one of their medallions after ten years he appears to die suddenly and requests his unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion since his return to mars would leave his earth body vulnerable in a comalike state he leaves burroughs clues about opening the tomb the film reverts to the original timeline burroughs races to carters tomb and opens it expecting to find carters body a thern in the form of a man with a bowler hat who has been shadowing carter for some time appears behind burroughs holding a weapon with which to destroy the body both are taken aback to see the tomb empty a shot rings out and the thern drops dead carter emerges and confesses to burroughs that he never found a medallion instead he had devised a scheme to lure a thern in order to get its medallion carter reiterates to burroughs that his body on earth needs protecting and recommends that burroughs enjoy his life on earth to fall in love and to write books he then takes the therns medallion whispers the code and is transported back to barsoom and dejah castedit taylor kitsch as john carter lynn

the interplanetary hero john carter and in later volumes the adventures of his children with dejah thoris the story was originally serialized in six monthly installments from february through to july  in the pulp magazine the allstory those chapters originally titled under the moons of mars were then collected in hardcover five years later from publisher a c mcclurg bob clampett involvementedit cover of the first edition of a princess of mars by burroughs mcclurg in  looney tunes director bob clampett approached edgar rice burroughs with the idea of adapting a princess of mars into a featurelength animated film burroughs responded enthusiastically recognizing that a regular liveaction feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately so he advised clampett to write an original animated adventure for john carter working with burroughs son john coleman burroughs in  clampett used rotoscope and other handdrawn techniques to capture the action tracing the motions of an athlete who performed john carters powerful movements in the reduced martian gravity and designed the greenskinned armed tharks to give them a believable appearance he then produced footage of them riding their eightlegged thoats at a gallop which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a martian volcano mgm was to release the cartoons and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series the test footage produced by  received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the us especially in small towns many gave their opinion that the concept of an earthman on mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern american audiences to accept the series was not given the goahead and clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated tarzan series an offer that he later declined clampett recognized the irony in mgms decision as the flash gordon movie serial released in the same year by universal studios was highly successful he speculated that mgm believed that serials were only played to children during saturday matinees whereas the john carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening the footage that clampett produced was believed lost for many years until burroughs grandson danton burroughs in the early s found some of the film tests in the edgar rice burroughs inc archives had a princess of mars been released it might have preceded walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs to become the first american featurelength animated film disney progressionedit during the late s famed stopmotion animation effects director ray harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels but it was not until the s that producers mario kassar and andrew g vajna bought the rights for walt disney studios with a view to creating a competitor to star wars and conan the barbarian ted elliott and terry rossio were hired to write while john mctiernan and tom cruise were approached to direct and star the project collapsed because mctiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate burroughs vision of barsoom the project remained at disney and jeffrey katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels but the rights eventually returned to the burroughs estate paramount effortedit producer james jacks read harry knowles autobiography which lavishly praised the john carter of mars series having read the burroughs novels as a child jacks was moved to convince paramount pictures to acquire the film rights a bidding war with columbia pictures followed after paramount and jacks won the rights jacks contacted knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired mark protosevich to write the screenplay robert rodriguez signed on in  to direct the film after his friend knowles showed him the script recognizing that knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer filming was set to begin in  with rodriguez planning to use the alldigital stages he was using for his production of sin city a film based on the graphic novel series by frank miller rodriguez planned to hire frank frazetta the popular burroughs and fantasy illustrator as a designer on the film rodriguez had previously stirredup film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit sin citys artistcreator frank miller as codirector on the film adaptation as a result of all the hoopla rodriguez decided to resign from the directors guild of america in  unable to employ a nondga filmmaker paramount assigned kerry conran to direct and ehren kruger to rewrite the john carter script the australian outback was scouted as a shooting location conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in october  by jon favreau favreau and screenwriter mark fergus wanted to make their script faithful to burroughs novels retaining john carters links to the american civil war and ensuring that the barsoomian tharks were  feet tall previous scripts had made them humansized favreau argued that a modernday soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like carter who had been a confederate officer the first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the barsoom series a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars unlike rodriguez and conran favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited planet of the apes as his inspiration he intended to use makeup as well as cgi to create the tharks in august  paramount chose not to renew the film rights preferring instead to focus on its star trek franchise favreau and fergus moved on to marvel studios iron man return to disney stanton involvementedit andrew stanton director of the pixar animation studios hits finding nemo  and walle  lobbied the walt disney studios to reacquire the rights from burroughs estate since id read the books as a kid i wanted to see somebody put it on the screen he explained he then lobbied disney heavily for the chance to direct the film pitching it as indiana jones on mars the studio was initially skeptical he had never directed a liveaction film before and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience at least on opening weekend the screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow but since stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make walle and finding nemo into hits the studio approved him as director stanton noted he was effectively being loaned to walt disney pictures because pixar is an allages brand and john carter in his words was not going to be an allages film by  they completed the first draft for part one of a john carter film trilogy the first film is based only on the first novel in april  author michael chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script following the completion of walle stanton visited the archives of edgar rice burroughs inc in tarzana california as part of his research jim morris general manager of pixar said the film would have a unique look that is distinct from frank frazettas illustrations which they both found dated he also noted that although he had less time for preproduction than for any of his usual animated projects the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read burroughs novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes productionedit filmingedit on john carter stanton was crafting a complicated interplanetary story with live action period elements and more than  visualeffects shots delivered by four companies the director said he coaxed disney to adopt some of pixars iterative style  —columnists dawn c chmielewski and rebecca keegan writing in the los angeles times principal photography commenced at longcross studios london in january  and ended in kanab utah in july  locations in utah included lake powell and the counties of grand wayne and kane a monthlong reshoot took place in playa vista los angeles the film was shot in the panavision anamorphic format on kodak  mm film stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time however he did admit to reshooting much of the movie twice far more than is usually common in live action filmmaking he attributed that to his animation background the thing i had to explain to disney was youre asking a guy whos only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot he explained later i said im not gonna get it right the first time ill tell you that right now stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at pixar on animated films known as the braintrust instead of those with liveaction experience working with him stanton also was quoted as saying i said to my producers ‘is it just me or do we actually know how to do this better than liveaction crews do’ rich ross disneys chairman successor to dick cook who had originally approved the film for production came from a television background and had no experience with feature films the studios new top marketing and production executives had little more marketingedit the head of walt disney studios marketing during the production was m t carney an industry outsider who previously ran a marketing boutique in new york stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio according to those who worked on the film stantons ideas were used instead and he ignored criticism that using led zeppelins  song kashmir in the trailer would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought he also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience stanton said “my joy when i saw the first trailer for star wars is i saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie and i had no idea how it connected and i had to go see the movie so the last thing i’m going to do is ruin that little kid’s experience” following the death of steve jobs stanton dedicated the film in his memory although being based on the first book of the series a princess of mars the film was originally titled john carter of mars but stanton removed of mars to make it more appealing to a broader audience stating that the film is an origin story its about a guy becoming john carter of mars stanton planned to keep mars in the title for future films in the series kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the characters journey as john carter would become of mars only in the last few minutes of the picture former disney marketing president carney has also taken blame for suggesting the title change another reported explanation for the name change was that disney had suffered a significant loss in march  with mars needs moms the studio reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word mars in the title had not been commercially successful earlier two and a half years before the premiere of the film on december   a lowbudget film produced by the independent film company the asylum entitled princess of mars was released directtodvd in the united states stanton has referred to the competing film as a crappy knockoff music and soundtrackedit

film it holds a  rating at the film review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on  reviews its consensus reads while john carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization at metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of  to critics reviews the film holds a score of  based on  reviews signifying mixed or average reviews todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter wrote derivative but charming and fun enough disneys mammoth scifier is both spectacular and a bit cheesy glenn kenny of msn movies rated the film  out of  stars saying by the end of the adventure even the initially befuddling doubleframe story pays off in spades for me this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that id willingly sit through a second or even third time roger ebert of the chicago suntimes rated the film  out of  stars commenting that the movie is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed does john carter get the job done for the weekend action audience yes i suppose it does dan jolin of empire gave the film  stars out of  noting stanton has built a fantastic world but the action is unmemorable still just about every scififantasysuperhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere joe neumaier of the new york daily news gave the film  out of  stars calling the film undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of but also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is in this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold  the movie is more western than science fiction even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value isnt it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at handtohand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with —roger ebert writing for the chicago suntimes conversely peter debruge of variety gave a negative review saying to watch john carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe stanton brought to finding nemo and walle owen glieberman of entertainment weekly gave the film a d rating feeling nothing in john carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better christy lemire of the boston globe wrote that except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor john carter is just a dreary convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computergenerated blippery converted to d michael philips of the chicago tribune rated the film  out of  stars saying the film isnt much – or rather its too much and not enough in weird clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur andrew oherir of saloncom called it a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels but if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence it’s also a riproaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second mick laselle of san francisco chronicle rated the film  star out of  noting john carter is a movie designed to be long epic and in d but thats as far as the design goes its designed to be a product and its a flimsy one ao scott of the new york times said john carter tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of bmovies pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines but it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic which buries the easy scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess a bad movie should not look this good in the uk the film was savaged by peter bradshaw in the guardian gaining only  star out of  and described as a giant suffocating doughy feast of boredom the film garnered  out of  stars in the daily telegraph described as a technical marvel but is also armrestclawingly hammy and painfully dated bbc film critic mark kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting the story telling is incomprehensible the characterisation is ludicrous the story is two and a quarter hours long and its a boring boring boring two and a quarter hours long box officeedit john carter earned  in north america and  in other countries for a worldwide total as of june  update of  it had a worldwide opening of  million in north america it opened in first place on friday march   with  million for three days it had grossed  million falling to second place for the weekend behind the lorax outside north america it topped the weekend chart opening with  million its highestgrossing opening was in russia and the cis where it broke the alltime openingday record  million and earned  million during the weekend the film also scored the secondbest opening weekend for a disney film in china  million it was in first place at the box office outside north america for two consecutive weekends its highestgrossing areas after north america are china  million russia and the cis  million and mexico  million although the film grossed nearly  million worldwide it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost at the time of its release disney claimed the films production budget was  million although tax returns released in  revealed its exact budget was  million after taking tax credits into account before the film opened analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant combined production and marketing costs of  million with paul dergarabedian president of hollywoodcom noting john carter’s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than  million to break evena height reached by only  films in the history of moviemaking on may   the walt disney company released a statement on its earnings which attributed the  million deterioration in the operating income of their studio entertainment division to a loss of  million in the quarter ending march  primarily to the performance of john carter and the associated cost writedown despite its moderate success at the boxoffice the film resulted in a  million writedown for disney ranking it among the biggest boxoffice bombs of alltime the films failure led to the resignation of rich ross the head of walt disney studios even though ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the disney channel with john carter already in development ross theoretically could have stopped production on john carter as he did with a planned remake of  leagues under the sea or minimized the budget as he did to the lone ranger starring johnny depp instead stanton was given the production budget requested for john carter backed with an estimated  million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tieins it was reported that ross later sought to blame pixar for john carter which prompted key pixar executives to turn against ross who already had alienated many within the studio the  book john carter and the gods of hollywood cites many factors in the films commercial failure but author michael d sellers insists the film tested very well with audiences and failed more because of marketing problems which included not mentioning mars barsoom or edgar rice burroughs on promotional posters which meant that many fans of the burroughs books were completely unaware of the film and its subject matter until after it bombed and changing management at the studio in september  studio president alan bergman was asked at a conference if disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on the lone ranger and john carter through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods and he responded im going to answer that question honestly and tell you no it didnt get that much better we did lose that much money on those movies accoladesedit

know the second script was awesome we had to plant a grounding so we could really take off in the second one the second one was even more emotionally taxing which was awesome stanton tweeted both titles and logos for the sequels that would have been made with the titles being gods of mars as the sequel and warlord of mars as the third film on october   it was confirmed that disney had allowed the film rights to the barsoom novels to revert to the edgar rice burroughs estate in november  stanton stated i will always mourn the fact that i didn’t get to make the other two films i planned for

inside the attorney executing the will hands burroughs carters journal which he reads hoping to find clues about carters death and the reason he is the willed heir the bulk of the film enacts what burroughs reads while prospecting in the arizona territory in  just after the civil war carter is arrested by union colonel powell who seeks his help in fighting the apache and insists that carter owes it to his country carter refuses stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by powell and his cavalry after encountering a band of apaches carter and the wounded powell take refuge in a cave which turns out to be the object of carters earlier search the spider cave of gold a mysterious priestly being a thern appears in the cave at that moment and surprised by carters presence immediately attacks him with a knife carter kills him but accidentally activates the therns powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of barsoom later revealed to be mars hundreds of millions of years in the past due to barsooms low gravity and his own relatively high bone density carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength he is captured by the tharks a clan of fourarmed green martians led by their jeddak chieftain tars tarkas tars instructs his loyal follower sola to watch over carter leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the martians language elsewhere on barsoom the human red martian city of helium led by thardos mors and the walking city of zodanga led by the villainous sab than dominic west have been at war for a thousand years sab than who wants to conquer all barsoom is armed with a special and highly destructive weapon given him by three therns in the midst of a shiptoship close quarters combat which the weapon ends by annihilating all the other participants than then proposes a ceasefire with helium and an end to the war sealed by marriage to mors daughter the princess of helium dejah thoris the unwilling princess disguised as a soldier escapes in a helium ship as tarkas tries to get carter to show off his jumping abilities a thark sentry spots a ship from helium and another from zodanga and the tharks scatter to hide carter races into action and leaps to save dejah from falling he kills some zodangan soldiers and briefly fights with than thans ship retreats and carter is hailed by tarkas as dotar sojat roughly translatable as my right arms for his strength and skill tarkas even grants him dejah as part of the thark spoils later carter accompanied by dejah tries to find a way to get back to earth and stumbles upon a temple ruin sacred to the tharks sola encounters them there and vainly tries to stop them from entering they discover an inscription depicting a way to earth in the sacred river of iss before carter dejah and sola are caught by tarkas rivals sarkoja and tal hajus the three are sentenced to death according to the thark code but are helped to escape by tarkas who reveals to carter that sola is his daughter hajus and sarkoja find the prisoners gone and the ambitious hajus declares that tarkas has betrayed them carter dejah sola and woola a calot  a large creature that resembles an amphibian and behaves like a loyal dog embark on a quest to the end of the sacred river to find a way home for carter they discover clues to the ninth ray a means of accessing infinite energy and the key to understanding how the medallion works they are attacked by the green martian clan of warhoon who have been manipulated by matai shang the leader of the therns to pursue them as part of thans latest plan after initially fleeing carter sends the others away and takes a stand fighting the horde himself as atonement for being unable to save his own family though defeating many warhoon carter is ultimately overpowered he is saved when mors intervenes in a helium ship than is also in the company mors says that than had come alone and had organized the rescue party dejah reluctantly agrees to marry than and carter is taken to zodanga to be healed upon awakening carter is led to dejahs room dejah sends the servant girls away and gives carter his medallion telling him to return to earth as dejah leaves with than carter is met by shang who takes carter prisoner and walks him around zodanga in different zodangan forms shang explains to carter the therns purpose how they manipulate the civilizations of various planets into selfdestruction he also reveals thans secret plan to kill dejah once he marries her and to destroy helium and rule barsoom so completing the course the therns have set for the planet shang also reveals that he and the therns had been doing this for millions of years and implies that earth is their next target carter escapes thanks to woola and he and sola return to the tharks to request their help there they discover hajus has overthrown tarkas tarkas carter and sola are thrown into an arena to be killed by two enormous fourarmed great white apes carter defeats them and then challenges and easily kills hajus so becoming jeddak of the tharks carter and his thark army charge on helium and defeat the zodangan army in a huge battle while than is killed by shang before revealing anything more about the therns to carter shang then escapes in the chaos of the battle dejah and carter marry and he becomes prince of helium on their first night carter decides to stay on mars forever and throws away his medallion seizing this opportunity shang in the form of a helium guard sends him back to earth trapping him there and away from mars back on earth carter concludes that there may be other thern waystations like the spider cave of gold and embarks on a long quest for clues of the therns presence on earth and hoping to find one of their medallions after ten years he appears to die suddenly and requests his unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion since his return to mars would leave his earth body vulnerable in a comalike state he leaves burroughs clues about opening the tomb the film reverts to the original timeline burroughs races to carters tomb and opens it expecting to find carters body a thern in the form of a man with a bowler hat who has been shadowing carter for some time appears behind burroughs holding a weapon with which to destroy the body both are taken aback to see the tomb empty a shot rings out and the thern drops dead carter emerges and confesses to burroughs that he never found a medallion instead he had devised a scheme to lure a thern in order to get its medallion carter reiterates to burroughs that his body on earth needs protecting and recommends that burroughs enjoy his life on earth to fall in love and to write books he then takes the therns medallion whispers the code and is transported back to barsoom and dejah castedit taylor kitsch as john carter lynn

the interplanetary hero john carter and in later volumes the adventures of his children with dejah thoris the story was originally serialized in six monthly installments from february through to july  in the pulp magazine the allstory those chapters originally titled under the moons of mars were then collected in hardcover five years later from publisher a c mcclurg bob clampett involvementedit cover of the first edition of a princess of mars by burroughs mcclurg in  looney tunes director bob clampett approached edgar rice burroughs with the idea of adapting a princess of mars into a featurelength animated film burroughs responded enthusiastically recognizing that a regular liveaction feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately so he advised clampett to write an original animated adventure for john carter working with burroughs son john coleman burroughs in  clampett used rotoscope and other handdrawn techniques to capture the action tracing the motions of an athlete who performed john carters powerful movements in the reduced martian gravity and designed the greenskinned armed tharks to give them a believable appearance he then produced footage of them riding their eightlegged thoats at a gallop which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a martian volcano mgm was to release the cartoons and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series the test footage produced by  received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the us especially in small towns many gave their opinion that the concept of an earthman on mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern american audiences to accept the series was not given the goahead and clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated tarzan series an offer that he later declined clampett recognized the irony in mgms decision as the flash gordon movie serial released in the same year by universal studios was highly successful he speculated that mgm believed that serials were only played to children during saturday matinees whereas the john carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening the footage that clampett produced was believed lost for many years until burroughs grandson danton burroughs in the early s found some of the film tests in the edgar rice burroughs inc archives had a princess of mars been released it might have preceded walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs to become the first american featurelength animated film disney progressionedit during the late s famed stopmotion animation effects director ray harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels but it was not until the s that producers mario kassar and andrew g vajna bought the rights for walt disney studios with a view to creating a competitor to star wars and conan the barbarian ted elliott and terry rossio were hired to write while john mctiernan and tom cruise were approached to direct and star the project collapsed because mctiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate burroughs vision of barsoom the project remained at disney and jeffrey katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels but the rights eventually returned to the burroughs estate paramount effortedit producer james jacks read harry knowles autobiography which lavishly praised the john carter of mars series having read the burroughs novels as a child jacks was moved to convince paramount pictures to acquire the film rights a bidding war with columbia pictures followed after paramount and jacks won the rights jacks contacted knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired mark protosevich to write the screenplay robert rodriguez signed on in  to direct the film after his friend knowles showed him the script recognizing that knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer filming was set to begin in  with rodriguez planning to use the alldigital stages he was using for his production of sin city a film based on the graphic novel series by frank miller rodriguez planned to hire frank frazetta the popular burroughs and fantasy illustrator as a designer on the film rodriguez had previously stirredup film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit sin citys artistcreator frank miller as codirector on the film adaptation as a result of all the hoopla rodriguez decided to resign from the directors guild of america in  unable to employ a nondga filmmaker paramount assigned kerry conran to direct and ehren kruger to rewrite the john carter script the australian outback was scouted as a shooting location conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in october  by jon favreau favreau and screenwriter mark fergus wanted to make their script faithful to burroughs novels retaining john carters links to the american civil war and ensuring that the barsoomian tharks were  feet tall previous scripts had made them humansized favreau argued that a modernday soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like carter who had been a confederate officer the first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the barsoom series a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars unlike rodriguez and conran favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited planet of the apes as his inspiration he intended to use makeup as well as cgi to create the tharks in august  paramount chose not to renew the film rights preferring instead to focus on its star trek franchise favreau and fergus moved on to marvel studios iron man return to disney stanton involvementedit andrew stanton director of the pixar animation studios hits finding nemo  and walle  lobbied the walt disney studios to reacquire the rights from burroughs estate since id read the books as a kid i wanted to see somebody put it on the screen he explained he then lobbied disney heavily for the chance to direct the film pitching it as indiana jones on mars the studio was initially skeptical he had never directed a liveaction film before and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience at least on opening weekend the screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow but since stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make walle and finding nemo into hits the studio approved him as director stanton noted he was effectively being loaned to walt disney pictures because pixar is an allages brand and john carter in his words was not going to be an allages film by  they completed the first draft for part one of a john carter film trilogy the first film is based only on the first novel in april  author michael chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script following the completion of walle stanton visited the archives of edgar rice burroughs inc in tarzana california as part of his research jim morris general manager of pixar said the film would have a unique look that is distinct from frank frazettas illustrations which they both found dated he also noted that although he had less time for preproduction than for any of his usual animated projects the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read burroughs novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes productionedit filmingedit on john carter stanton was crafting a complicated interplanetary story with live action period elements and more than  visualeffects shots delivered by four companies the director said he coaxed disney to adopt some of pixars iterative style  —columnists dawn c chmielewski and rebecca keegan writing in the los angeles times principal photography commenced at longcross studios london in january  and ended in kanab utah in july  locations in utah included lake powell and the counties of grand wayne and kane a monthlong reshoot took place in playa vista los angeles the film was shot in the panavision anamorphic format on kodak  mm film stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time however he did admit to reshooting much of the movie twice far more than is usually common in live action filmmaking he attributed that to his animation background the thing i had to explain to disney was youre asking a guy whos only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot he explained later i said im not gonna get it right the first time ill tell you that right now stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at pixar on animated films known as the braintrust instead of those with liveaction experience working with him stanton also was quoted as saying i said to my producers ‘is it just me or do we actually know how to do this better than liveaction crews do’ rich ross disneys chairman successor to dick cook who had originally approved the film for production came from a television background and had no experience with feature films the studios new top marketing and production executives had little more marketingedit the head of walt disney studios marketing during the production was m t carney an industry outsider who previously ran a marketing boutique in new york stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio according to those who worked on the film stantons ideas were used instead and he ignored criticism that using led zeppelins  song kashmir in the trailer would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought he also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience stanton said “my joy when i saw the first trailer for star wars is i saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie and i had no idea how it connected and i had to go see the movie so the last thing i’m going to do is ruin that little kid’s experience” following the death of steve jobs stanton dedicated the film in his memory although being based on the first book of the series a princess of mars the film was originally titled john carter of mars but stanton removed of mars to make it more appealing to a broader audience stating that the film is an origin story its about a guy becoming john carter of mars stanton planned to keep mars in the title for future films in the series kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the characters journey as john carter would become of mars only in the last few minutes of the picture former disney marketing president carney has also taken blame for suggesting the title change another reported explanation for the name change was that disney had suffered a significant loss in march  with mars needs moms the studio reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word mars in the title had not been commercially successful earlier two and a half years before the premiere of the film on december   a lowbudget film produced by the independent film company the asylum entitled princess of mars was released directtodvd in the united states stanton has referred to the competing film as a crappy knockoff music and soundtrackedit

film it holds a  rating at the film review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on  reviews its consensus reads while john carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization at metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of  to critics reviews the film holds a score of  based on  reviews signifying mixed or average reviews todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter wrote derivative but charming and fun enough disneys mammoth scifier is both spectacular and a bit cheesy glenn kenny of msn movies rated the film  out of  stars saying by the end of the adventure even the initially befuddling doubleframe story pays off in spades for me this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that id willingly sit through a second or even third time roger ebert of the chicago suntimes rated the film  out of  stars commenting that the movie is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed does john carter get the job done for the weekend action audience yes i suppose it does dan jolin of empire gave the film  stars out of  noting stanton has built a fantastic world but the action is unmemorable still just about every scififantasysuperhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere joe neumaier of the new york daily news gave the film  out of  stars calling the film undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of but also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is in this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold  the movie is more western than science fiction even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value isnt it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at handtohand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with —roger ebert writing for the chicago suntimes conversely peter debruge of variety gave a negative review saying to watch john carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe stanton brought to finding nemo and walle owen glieberman of entertainment weekly gave the film a d rating feeling nothing in john carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better christy lemire of the boston globe wrote that except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor john carter is just a dreary convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computergenerated blippery converted to d michael philips of the chicago tribune rated the film  out of  stars saying the film isnt much – or rather its too much and not enough in weird clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur andrew oherir of saloncom called it a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels but if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence it’s also a riproaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second mick laselle of san francisco chronicle rated the film  star out of  noting john carter is a movie designed to be long epic and in d but thats as far as the design goes its designed to be a product and its a flimsy one ao scott of the new york times said john carter tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of bmovies pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines but it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic which buries the easy scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess a bad movie should not look this good in the uk the film was savaged by peter bradshaw in the guardian gaining only  star out of  and described as a giant suffocating doughy feast of boredom the film garnered  out of  stars in the daily telegraph described as a technical marvel but is also armrestclawingly hammy and painfully dated bbc film critic mark kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting the story telling is incomprehensible the characterisation is ludicrous the story is two and a quarter hours long and its a boring boring boring two and a quarter hours long box officeedit john carter earned  in north america and  in other countries for a worldwide total as of june  update of  it had a worldwide opening of  million in north america it opened in first place on friday march   with  million for three days it had grossed  million falling to second place for the weekend behind the lorax outside north america it topped the weekend chart opening with  million its highestgrossing opening was in russia and the cis where it broke the alltime openingday record  million and earned  million during the weekend the film also scored the secondbest opening weekend for a disney film in china  million it was in first place at the box office outside north america for two consecutive weekends its highestgrossing areas after north america are china  million russia and the cis  million and mexico  million although the film grossed nearly  million worldwide it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost at the time of its release disney claimed the films production budget was  million although tax returns released in  revealed its exact budget was  million after taking tax credits into account before the film opened analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant combined production and marketing costs of  million with paul dergarabedian president of hollywoodcom noting john carter’s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than  million to break evena height reached by only  films in the history of moviemaking on may   the walt disney company released a statement on its earnings which attributed the  million deterioration in the operating income of their studio entertainment division to a loss of  million in the quarter ending march  primarily to the performance of john carter and the associated cost writedown despite its moderate success at the boxoffice the film resulted in a  million writedown for disney ranking it among the biggest boxoffice bombs of alltime the films failure led to the resignation of rich ross the head of walt disney studios even though ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the disney channel with john carter already in development ross theoretically could have stopped production on john carter as he did with a planned remake of  leagues under the sea or minimized the budget as he did to the lone ranger starring johnny depp instead stanton was given the production budget requested for john carter backed with an estimated  million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tieins it was reported that ross later sought to blame pixar for john carter which prompted key pixar executives to turn against ross who already had alienated many within the studio the  book john carter and the gods of hollywood cites many factors in the films commercial failure but author michael d sellers insists the film tested very well with audiences and failed more because of marketing problems which included not mentioning mars barsoom or edgar rice burroughs on promotional posters which meant that many fans of the burroughs books were completely unaware of the film and its subject matter until after it bombed and changing management at the studio in september  studio president alan bergman was asked at a conference if disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on the lone ranger and john carter through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods and he responded im going to answer that question honestly and tell you no it didnt get that much better we did lose that much money on those movies accoladesedit

the film rights to the barsoom novels to revert to the edgar rice burroughs estate in november  stanton stated i will always mourn the fact that i didn’t get to make the other two films i planned for

and his thark army charge on helium and defeat the zodangan army in a huge battle while than is killed by shang before revealing anything more about the therns to carter shang then escapes in the chaos of the battle dejah and carter marry and he becomes prince of helium on their first night carter decides to stay on mars forever and throws away his medallion seizing this opportunity shang in the form of a helium guard sends him back to earth trapping him there and away from mars back on earth carter concludes that there may be other thern waystations like the spider cave of gold and embarks on a long quest for clues of the therns presence on earth and hoping to find one of their medallions after ten years he appears to die suddenly and requests his unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion since his return to mars would leave his earth body vulnerable in a comalike state he leaves burroughs clues about opening the tomb the film reverts to the original timeline burroughs races to carters tomb and opens it expecting to find carters body a thern in the form of a man with a bowler hat who has been shadowing carter for some time appears behind burroughs holding a weapon with which to destroy the body both are taken aback to see the tomb empty a shot rings out and the thern drops dead carter emerges and confesses to burroughs that he never found a medallion instead he had devised a scheme to lure a thern in order to get its medallion carter reiterates to burroughs that his body on earth needs protecting and recommends that burroughs enjoy his life on earth to fall in love and to write books he then takes the therns medallion whispers the code and is transported back to barsoom and dejah castedit taylor kitsch as john carter lynn

the interplanetary hero john carter and in later volumes the adventures of his children with dejah thoris the story was originally serialized in six monthly installments from february through to july  in the pulp magazine the allstory those chapters originally titled under the moons of mars were then collected in hardcover five years later from publisher a c mcclurg bob clampett involvementedit cover of the first edition of a princess of mars by burroughs mcclurg in  looney tunes director bob clampett approached edgar rice burroughs with the idea of adapting a princess of mars into a featurelength animated film burroughs responded enthusiastically recognizing that a regular liveaction feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately so he advised clampett to write an original animated adventure for john carter working with burroughs son john coleman burroughs in  clampett used rotoscope and other handdrawn techniques to capture the action tracing the motions of an athlete who performed john carters powerful movements in the reduced martian gravity and designed the greenskinned armed tharks to give them a believable appearance he then produced footage of them riding their eightlegged thoats at a gallop which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a martian volcano mgm was to release the cartoons and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series the test footage produced by  received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the us especially in small towns many gave their opinion that the concept of an earthman on mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern american audiences to accept the series was not given the goahead and clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated tarzan series an offer that he later declined clampett recognized the irony in mgms decision as the flash gordon movie serial released in the same year by universal studios was highly successful he speculated that mgm believed that serials were only played to children during saturday matinees whereas the john carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening the footage that clampett produced was believed lost for many years until burroughs grandson danton burroughs in the early s found some of the film tests in the edgar rice burroughs inc archives had a princess of mars been released it might have preceded walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs to become the first american featurelength animated film disney progressionedit during the late s famed stopmotion animation effects director ray harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels but it was not until the s that producers mario kassar and andrew g vajna bought the rights for walt disney studios with a view to creating a competitor to star wars and conan the barbarian ted elliott and terry rossio were hired to write while john mctiernan and tom cruise were approached to direct and star the project collapsed because mctiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate burroughs vision of barsoom the project remained at disney and jeffrey katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels but the rights eventually returned to the burroughs estate paramount effortedit producer james jacks read harry knowles autobiography which lavishly praised the john carter of mars series having read the burroughs novels as a child jacks was moved to convince paramount pictures to acquire the film rights a bidding war with columbia pictures followed after paramount and jacks won the rights jacks contacted knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired mark protosevich to write the screenplay robert rodriguez signed on in  to direct the film after his friend knowles showed him the script recognizing that knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer filming was set to begin in  with rodriguez planning to use the alldigital stages he was using for his production of sin city a film based on the graphic novel series by frank miller rodriguez planned to hire frank frazetta the popular burroughs and fantasy illustrator as a designer on the film rodriguez had previously stirredup film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit sin citys artistcreator frank miller as codirector on the film adaptation as a result of all the hoopla rodriguez decided to resign from the directors guild of america in  unable to employ a nondga filmmaker paramount assigned kerry conran to direct and ehren kruger to rewrite the john carter script the australian outback was scouted as a shooting location conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in october  by jon favreau favreau and screenwriter mark fergus wanted to make their script faithful to burroughs novels retaining john carters links to the american civil war and ensuring that the barsoomian tharks were  feet tall previous scripts had made them humansized favreau argued that a modernday soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like carter who had been a confederate officer the first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the barsoom series a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars unlike rodriguez and conran favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited planet of the apes as his inspiration he intended to use makeup as well as cgi to create the tharks in august  paramount chose not to renew the film rights preferring instead to focus on its star trek franchise favreau and fergus moved on to marvel studios iron man return to disney stanton involvementedit andrew stanton director of the pixar animation studios hits finding nemo  and walle  lobbied the walt disney studios to reacquire the rights from burroughs estate since id read the books as a kid i wanted to see somebody put it on the screen he explained he then lobbied disney heavily for the chance to direct the film pitching it as indiana jones on mars the studio was initially skeptical he had never directed a liveaction film before and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience at least on opening weekend the screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow but since stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make walle and finding nemo into hits the studio approved him as director stanton noted he was effectively being loaned to walt disney pictures because pixar is an allages brand and john carter in his words was not going to be an allages film by  they completed the first draft for part one of a john carter film trilogy the first film is based only on the first novel in april  author michael chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script following the completion of walle stanton visited the archives of edgar rice burroughs inc in tarzana california as part of his research jim morris general manager of pixar said the film would have a unique look that is distinct from frank frazettas illustrations which they both found dated he also noted that although he had less time for preproduction than for any of his usual animated projects the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read burroughs novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes productionedit filmingedit on john carter stanton was crafting a complicated interplanetary story with live action period elements and more than  visualeffects shots delivered by four companies the director said he coaxed disney to adopt some of pixars iterative style  —columnists dawn c chmielewski and rebecca keegan writing in the los angeles times principal photography commenced at longcross studios london in january  and ended in kanab utah in july  locations in utah included lake powell and the counties of grand wayne and kane a monthlong reshoot took place in playa vista los angeles the film was shot in the panavision anamorphic format on kodak  mm film stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time however he did admit to reshooting much of the movie twice far more than is usually common in live action filmmaking he attributed that to his animation background the thing i had to explain to disney was youre asking a guy whos only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot he explained later i said im not gonna get it right the first time ill tell you that right now stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at pixar on animated films known as the braintrust instead of those with liveaction experience working with him stanton also was quoted as saying i said to my producers ‘is it just me or do we actually know how to do this better than liveaction crews do’ rich ross disneys chairman successor to dick cook who had originally approved the film for production came from a television background and had no experience with feature films the studios new top marketing and production executives had little more marketingedit the head of walt disney studios marketing during the production was m t carney an industry outsider who previously ran a marketing boutique in new york stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio according to those who worked on the film stantons ideas were used instead and he ignored criticism that using led zeppelins  song kashmir in the trailer would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought he also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience stanton said “my joy when i saw the first trailer for star wars is i saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie and i had no idea how it connected and i had to go see the movie so the last thing i’m going to do is ruin that little kid’s experience” following the death of steve jobs stanton dedicated the film in his memory although being based on the first book of the series a princess of mars the film was originally titled john carter of mars but stanton removed of mars to make it more appealing to a broader audience stating that the film is an origin story its about a guy becoming john carter of mars stanton planned to keep mars in the title for future films in the series kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the characters journey as john carter would become of mars only in the last few minutes of the picture former disney marketing president carney has also taken blame for suggesting the title change another reported explanation for the name change was that disney had suffered a significant loss in march  with mars needs moms the studio reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word mars in the title had not been commercially successful earlier two and a half years before the premiere of the film on december   a lowbudget film produced by the independent film company the asylum entitled princess of mars was released directtodvd in the united states stanton has referred to the competing film as a crappy knockoff music and soundtrackedit

film it holds a  rating at the film review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on  reviews its consensus reads while john carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization at metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of  to critics reviews the film holds a score of  based on  reviews signifying mixed or average reviews todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter wrote derivative but charming and fun enough disneys mammoth scifier is both spectacular and a bit cheesy glenn kenny of msn movies rated the film  out of  stars saying by the end of the adventure even the initially befuddling doubleframe story pays off in spades for me this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that id willingly sit through a second or even third time roger ebert of the chicago suntimes rated the film  out of  stars commenting that the movie is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed does john carter get the job done for the weekend action audience yes i suppose it does dan jolin of empire gave the film  stars out of  noting stanton has built a fantastic world but the action is unmemorable still just about every scififantasysuperhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere joe neumaier of the new york daily news gave the film  out of  stars calling the film undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of but also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is in this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold  the movie is more western than science fiction even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value isnt it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at handtohand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with —roger ebert writing for the chicago suntimes conversely peter debruge of variety gave a negative review saying to watch john carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe stanton brought to finding nemo and walle owen glieberman of entertainment weekly gave the film a d rating feeling nothing in john carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better christy lemire of the boston globe wrote that except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor john carter is just a dreary convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computergenerated blippery converted to d michael philips of the chicago tribune rated the film  out of  stars saying the film isnt much – or rather its too much and not enough in weird clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur andrew oherir of saloncom called it a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels but if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence it’s also a riproaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second mick laselle of san francisco chronicle rated the film  star out of  noting john carter is a movie designed to be long epic and in d but thats as far as the design goes its designed to be a product and its a flimsy one ao scott of the new york times said john carter tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of bmovies pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines but it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic which buries the easy scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess a bad movie should not look this good in the uk the film was savaged by peter bradshaw in the guardian gaining only  star out of  and described as a giant suffocating doughy feast of boredom the film garnered  out of  stars in the daily telegraph described as a technical marvel but is also armrestclawingly hammy and painfully dated bbc film critic mark kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting the story telling is incomprehensible the characterisation is ludicrous the story is two and a quarter hours long and its a boring boring boring two and a quarter hours long box officeedit john carter earned  in north america and  in other countries for a worldwide total as of june  update of  it had a worldwide opening of  million in north america it opened in first place on friday march   with  million for three days it had grossed  million falling to second place for the weekend behind the lorax outside north america it topped the weekend chart opening with  million its highestgrossing opening was in russia and the cis where it broke the alltime openingday record  million and earned  million during the weekend the film also scored the secondbest opening weekend for a disney film in china  million it was in first place at the box office outside north america for two consecutive weekends its highestgrossing areas after north america are china  million russia and the cis  million and mexico  million although the film grossed nearly  million worldwide it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost at the time of its release disney claimed the films production budget was  million although tax returns released in  revealed its exact budget was  million after taking tax credits into account before the film opened analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant combined production and marketing costs of  million with paul dergarabedian president of hollywoodcom noting john carter’s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than  million to break evena height reached by only  films in the history of moviemaking on may   the walt disney company released a statement on its earnings which attributed the  million deterioration in the operating income of their studio entertainment division to a loss of  million in the quarter ending march  primarily to the performance of john carter and the associated cost writedown despite its moderate success at the boxoffice the film resulted in a  million writedown for disney ranking it among the biggest boxoffice bombs of alltime the films failure led to the resignation of rich ross the head of walt disney studios even though ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the disney channel with john carter already in development ross theoretically could have stopped production on john carter as he did with a planned remake of  leagues under the sea or minimized the budget as he did to the lone ranger starring johnny depp instead stanton was given the production budget requested for john carter backed with an estimated  million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tieins it was reported that ross later sought to blame pixar for john carter which prompted key pixar executives to turn against ross who already had alienated many within the studio the  book john carter and the gods of hollywood cites many factors in the films commercial failure but author michael d sellers insists the film tested very well with audiences and failed more because of marketing problems which included not mentioning mars barsoom or edgar rice burroughs on promotional posters which meant that many fans of the burroughs books were completely unaware of the film and its subject matter until after it bombed and changing management at the studio in september  studio president alan bergman was asked at a conference if disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on the lone ranger and john carter through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods and he responded im going to answer that question honestly and tell you no it didnt get that much better we did lose that much money on those movies accoladesedit

burroughs reads while prospecting in the arizona territory in  just after the civil war carter is arrested by union colonel powell who seeks his help in fighting the apache and insists that carter owes it to his country carter refuses stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by powell and his cavalry after encountering a band of apaches carter and the wounded powell take refuge in a cave which turns out to be the object of carters earlier search the spider cave of gold a mysterious priestly being a thern appears in the cave at that moment and surprised by carters presence immediately attacks him with a knife carter kills him but accidentally activates the therns powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of barsoom later revealed to be mars hundreds of millions of years in the past due to barsooms low gravity and his own relatively high bone density carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength he is captured by the tharks a clan of fourarmed green martians led by their jeddak chieftain tars tarkas tars instructs his loyal follower sola to watch over carter leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the martians language elsewhere on barsoom the human red martian city of helium led by thardos mors and the walking city of zodanga led by the villainous sab than dominic west have been at war for a thousand years sab than who wants to conquer all barsoom is armed with a special and highly destructive weapon given him by three therns in the midst of a shiptoship close quarters combat which the weapon ends by annihilating all the other participants than then proposes a ceasefire with helium and an end to the war sealed by marriage to mors daughter the princess of helium dejah thoris the unwilling princess disguised as a soldier escapes in a helium ship as tarkas tries to get carter to show off his jumping abilities a thark sentry spots a ship from helium and another from zodanga and the tharks scatter to hide carter races into action and leaps to save dejah from falling he kills some zodangan soldiers and briefly fights with than thans ship retreats and carter is hailed by tarkas as dotar sojat roughly translatable as my right arms for his strength and skill tarkas even grants him dejah as part of the thark spoils later carter accompanied by dejah tries to find a way to get back to earth and stumbles upon a temple ruin sacred to the tharks sola encounters them there and vainly tries to stop them from entering they discover an inscription depicting a way to earth in the sacred river of iss before carter dejah and sola are caught by tarkas rivals sarkoja and tal hajus the three are sentenced to death according to the thark code but are helped to escape by tarkas who reveals to carter that sola is his daughter hajus and sarkoja find the prisoners gone and the ambitious hajus declares that tarkas has betrayed them carter dejah sola and woola a calot  a large creature that resembles an amphibian and behaves like a loyal dog embark on a quest to the end of the sacred river to find a way home for carter they discover clues to the ninth ray a means of accessing infinite energy and the key to understanding how the medallion works they are attacked by the green martian clan of warhoon who have been manipulated by matai shang the leader of the therns to pursue them as part of thans latest plan after initially fleeing carter sends the others away and takes a stand fighting the horde himself as atonement for being unable to save his own family though defeating many warhoon carter is ultimately overpowered he is saved when mors intervenes in a helium ship than is also in the company mors says that than had come alone and had organized the rescue party dejah reluctantly agrees to marry than and carter is taken to zodanga to be healed upon awakening carter is led to dejahs room dejah sends the servant girls away and gives carter his medallion telling him to return to earth as dejah leaves with than carter is met by shang who takes carter prisoner and walks him around zodanga in different zodangan forms shang explains to carter the therns purpose how they manipulate the civilizations of various planets into selfdestruction he also reveals thans secret plan to kill dejah once he marries her and to destroy helium and rule barsoom so completing the course the therns have set for the planet shang also reveals that he and the therns had been doing this for millions of years and implies that earth is their next target carter escapes thanks to woola and he and sola return to the tharks to request their help there they discover hajus has overthrown tarkas tarkas carter and sola are thrown into an arena to be killed by two enormous fourarmed great white apes carter defeats them and then challenges and easily kills hajus so becoming jeddak of the tharks carter and his thark army charge on helium and defeat the zodangan army in a huge battle while than is killed by shang before revealing anything more about the therns to carter shang then escapes in the chaos of the battle dejah and carter marry and he becomes prince of helium on their first night carter decides to stay on mars forever and throws away his medallion seizing this opportunity shang in the form of a helium guard sends him back to earth trapping him there and away from mars back on earth carter concludes that there may be other thern waystations like the spider cave of gold and embarks on a long quest for clues of the therns presence on earth and hoping to find one of their medallions after ten years he appears to die suddenly and requests his unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion since his return to mars would leave his earth body vulnerable in a comalike state he leaves burroughs clues about opening the tomb the film reverts to the original timeline burroughs races to carters tomb and opens it expecting to find carters body a thern in the form of a man with a bowler hat who has been shadowing carter for some time appears behind burroughs holding a weapon with which to destroy the body both are taken aback to see the tomb empty a shot rings out and the thern drops dead carter emerges and confesses to burroughs that he never found a medallion instead he had devised a scheme to lure a thern in order to get its medallion carter reiterates to burroughs that his body on earth needs protecting and recommends that burroughs enjoy his life on earth to fall in love and to write books he then takes the therns medallion whispers the code and is transported back to barsoom and dejah castedit taylor kitsch as john carter lynn

the interplanetary hero john carter and in later volumes the adventures of his children with dejah thoris the story was originally serialized in six monthly installments from february through to july  in the pulp magazine the allstory those chapters originally titled under the moons of mars were then collected in hardcover five years later from publisher a c mcclurg bob clampett involvementedit cover of the first edition of a princess of mars by burroughs mcclurg in  looney tunes director bob clampett approached edgar rice burroughs with the idea of adapting a princess of mars into a featurelength animated film burroughs responded enthusiastically recognizing that a regular liveaction feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately so he advised clampett to write an original animated adventure for john carter working with burroughs son john coleman burroughs in  clampett used rotoscope and other handdrawn techniques to capture the action tracing the motions of an athlete who performed john carters powerful movements in the reduced martian gravity and designed the greenskinned armed tharks to give them a believable appearance he then produced footage of them riding their eightlegged thoats at a gallop which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a martian volcano mgm was to release the cartoons and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series the test footage produced by  received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the us especially in small towns many gave their opinion that the concept of an earthman on mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern american audiences to accept the series was not given the goahead and clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated tarzan series an offer that he later declined clampett recognized the irony in mgms decision as the flash gordon movie serial released in the same year by universal studios was highly successful he speculated that mgm believed that serials were only played to children during saturday matinees whereas the john carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening the footage that clampett produced was believed lost for many years until burroughs grandson danton burroughs in the early s found some of the film tests in the edgar rice burroughs inc archives had a princess of mars been released it might have preceded walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs to become the first american featurelength animated film disney progressionedit during the late s famed stopmotion animation effects director ray harryhausen expressed interest in filming the novels but it was not until the s that producers mario kassar and andrew g vajna bought the rights for walt disney studios with a view to creating a competitor to star wars and conan the barbarian ted elliott and terry rossio were hired to write while john mctiernan and tom cruise were approached to direct and star the project collapsed because mctiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate burroughs vision of barsoom the project remained at disney and jeffrey katzenberg was a strong proponent of filming the novels but the rights eventually returned to the burroughs estate paramount effortedit producer james jacks read harry knowles autobiography which lavishly praised the john carter of mars series having read the burroughs novels as a child jacks was moved to convince paramount pictures to acquire the film rights a bidding war with columbia pictures followed after paramount and jacks won the rights jacks contacted knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired mark protosevich to write the screenplay robert rodriguez signed on in  to direct the film after his friend knowles showed him the script recognizing that knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer filming was set to begin in  with rodriguez planning to use the alldigital stages he was using for his production of sin city a film based on the graphic novel series by frank miller rodriguez planned to hire frank frazetta the popular burroughs and fantasy illustrator as a designer on the film rodriguez had previously stirredup film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit sin citys artistcreator frank miller as codirector on the film adaptation as a result of all the hoopla rodriguez decided to resign from the directors guild of america in  unable to employ a nondga filmmaker paramount assigned kerry conran to direct and ehren kruger to rewrite the john carter script the australian outback was scouted as a shooting location conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in october  by jon favreau favreau and screenwriter mark fergus wanted to make their script faithful to burroughs novels retaining john carters links to the american civil war and ensuring that the barsoomian tharks were  feet tall previous scripts had made them humansized favreau argued that a modernday soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like carter who had been a confederate officer the first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the barsoom series a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars unlike rodriguez and conran favreau preferred using practical effects for his film and cited planet of the apes as his inspiration he intended to use makeup as well as cgi to create the tharks in august  paramount chose not to renew the film rights preferring instead to focus on its star trek franchise favreau and fergus moved on to marvel studios iron man return to disney stanton involvementedit andrew stanton director of the pixar animation studios hits finding nemo  and walle  lobbied the walt disney studios to reacquire the rights from burroughs estate since id read the books as a kid i wanted to see somebody put it on the screen he explained he then lobbied disney heavily for the chance to direct the film pitching it as indiana jones on mars the studio was initially skeptical he had never directed a liveaction film before and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience at least on opening weekend the screenplay was seen as confusing and difficult to follow but since stanton had overcome similar preproduction doubts to make walle and finding nemo into hits the studio approved him as director stanton noted he was effectively being loaned to walt disney pictures because pixar is an allages brand and john carter in his words was not going to be an allages film by  they completed the first draft for part one of a john carter film trilogy the first film is based only on the first novel in april  author michael chabon confirmed he had been hired to revise the script following the completion of walle stanton visited the archives of edgar rice burroughs inc in tarzana california as part of his research jim morris general manager of pixar said the film would have a unique look that is distinct from frank frazettas illustrations which they both found dated he also noted that although he had less time for preproduction than for any of his usual animated projects the task was nevertheless relatively easy since he had read burroughs novels as a child and had already visualized many of their scenes productionedit filmingedit on john carter stanton was crafting a complicated interplanetary story with live action period elements and more than  visualeffects shots delivered by four companies the director said he coaxed disney to adopt some of pixars iterative style  —columnists dawn c chmielewski and rebecca keegan writing in the los angeles times principal photography commenced at longcross studios london in january  and ended in kanab utah in july  locations in utah included lake powell and the counties of grand wayne and kane a monthlong reshoot took place in playa vista los angeles the film was shot in the panavision anamorphic format on kodak  mm film stanton denied assertions that he had gone over budget and stated that he had been allowed a longer reshoot because he had stayed on budget and on time however he did admit to reshooting much of the movie twice far more than is usually common in live action filmmaking he attributed that to his animation background the thing i had to explain to disney was youre asking a guy whos only known how to do it this way to suddenly do it with one reshoot he explained later i said im not gonna get it right the first time ill tell you that right now stanton often sought advice from people he had worked with at pixar on animated films known as the braintrust instead of those with liveaction experience working with him stanton also was quoted as saying i said to my producers ‘is it just me or do we actually know how to do this better than liveaction crews do’ rich ross disneys chairman successor to dick cook who had originally approved the film for production came from a television background and had no experience with feature films the studios new top marketing and production executives had little more marketingedit the head of walt disney studios marketing during the production was m t carney an industry outsider who previously ran a marketing boutique in new york stanton often rejected marketing ideas from the studio according to those who worked on the film stantons ideas were used instead and he ignored criticism that using led zeppelins  song kashmir in the trailer would make it seem less current to the contemporary younger audiences the film sought he also chose billboard imagery that failed to resonate with prospective audiences and put together a preview reel that did not get a strong reception from a convention audience stanton said “my joy when i saw the first trailer for star wars is i saw a little bit of almost everything in the movie and i had no idea how it connected and i had to go see the movie so the last thing i’m going to do is ruin that little kid’s experience” following the death of steve jobs stanton dedicated the film in his memory although being based on the first book of the series a princess of mars the film was originally titled john carter of mars but stanton removed of mars to make it more appealing to a broader audience stating that the film is an origin story its about a guy becoming john carter of mars stanton planned to keep mars in the title for future films in the series kitsch said the title was changed to reflect the characters journey as john carter would become of mars only in the last few minutes of the picture former disney marketing president carney has also taken blame for suggesting the title change another reported explanation for the name change was that disney had suffered a significant loss in march  with mars needs moms the studio reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word mars in the title had not been commercially successful earlier two and a half years before the premiere of the film on december   a lowbudget film produced by the independent film company the asylum entitled princess of mars was released directtodvd in the united states stanton has referred to the competing film as a crappy knockoff music and soundtrackedit

kenny of msn movies rated the film  out of  stars saying by the end of the adventure even the initially befuddling doubleframe story pays off in spades for me this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that id willingly sit through a second or even third time roger ebert of the chicago suntimes rated the film  out of  stars commenting that the movie is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed does john carter get the job done for the weekend action audience yes i suppose it does dan jolin of empire gave the film  stars out of  noting stanton has built a fantastic world but the action is unmemorable still just about every scififantasysuperhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere joe neumaier of the new york daily news gave the film  out of  stars calling the film undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of but also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is in this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold  the movie is more western than science fiction even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value isnt it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at handtohand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with —roger ebert writing for the chicago suntimes conversely peter debruge of variety gave a negative review saying to watch john carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe stanton brought to finding nemo and walle owen glieberman of entertainment weekly gave the film a d rating feeling nothing in john carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better christy lemire of the boston globe wrote that except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor john carter is just a dreary convoluted trudge – a soulless sprawl of computergenerated blippery converted to d michael philips of the chicago tribune rated the film  out of  stars saying the film isnt much – or rather its too much and not enough in weird clumpy combinations – but it is a curious sort of blur andrew oherir of saloncom called it a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels but if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence it’s also a riproaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second mick laselle of san francisco chronicle rated the film  star out of  noting john carter is a movie designed to be long epic and in d but thats as far as the design goes its designed to be a product and its a flimsy one ao scott of the new york times said john carter tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of bmovies pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines but it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic which buries the easy scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess a bad movie should not look this good in the uk the film was savaged by peter bradshaw in the guardian gaining only  star out of  and described as a giant suffocating doughy feast of boredom the film garnered  out of  stars in the daily telegraph described as a technical marvel but is also armrestclawingly hammy and painfully dated bbc film critic mark kermode expressed his displeasure with the film commenting the story telling is incomprehensible the characterisation is ludicrous the story is two and a quarter hours long and its a boring boring boring two and a quarter hours long box officeedit john carter earned  in north america and  in other countries for a worldwide total as of june  update of  it had a worldwide opening of  million in north america it opened in first place on friday march   with  million for three days it had grossed  million falling to second place for the weekend behind the lorax outside north america it topped the weekend chart opening with  million its highestgrossing opening was in russia and the cis where it broke the alltime openingday record  million and earned  million during the weekend the film also scored the secondbest opening weekend for a disney film in china  million it was in first place at the box office outside north america for two consecutive weekends its highestgrossing areas after north america are china  million russia and the cis  million and mexico  million although the film grossed nearly  million worldwide it lost a considerable amount of money due to its cost at the time of its release disney claimed the films production budget was  million although tax returns released in  revealed its exact budget was  million after taking tax credits into account before the film opened analysts predicted the film would be a huge financial failure due to its exorbitant combined production and marketing costs of  million with paul dergarabedian president of hollywoodcom noting john carter’s bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than  million to break evena height reached by only  films in the history of moviemaking on may   the walt disney company released a statement on its earnings which attributed the  million deterioration in the operating income of their studio entertainment division to a loss of  million in the quarter ending march  primarily to the performance of john carter and the associated cost writedown despite its moderate success at the boxoffice the film resulted in a  million writedown for disney ranking it among the biggest boxoffice bombs of alltime the films failure led to the resignation of rich ross the head of walt disney studios even though ross had arrived there from his earlier success at the disney channel with john carter already in development ross theoretically could have stopped production on john carter as he did with a planned remake of  leagues under the sea or minimized the budget as he did to the lone ranger starring johnny depp instead stanton was given the production budget requested for john carter backed with an estimated  million marketing campaign that is typical for a tentpole movie but without significant merchandising or other ancillary tieins it was reported that ross later sought to blame pixar for john carter which prompted key pixar executives to turn against ross who already had alienated many within the studio the  book john carter and the gods of hollywood cites many factors in the films commercial failure but author michael d sellers insists the film tested very well with audiences and failed more because of marketing problems which included not mentioning mars barsoom or edgar rice burroughs on promotional posters which meant that many fans of the burroughs books were completely unaware of the film and its subject matter until after it bombed and changing management at the studio in september  studio president alan bergman was asked at a conference if disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on the lone ranger and john carter through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods and he responded im going to answer that question honestly and tell you no it didnt get that much better we did lose that much money on those movies accoladesedit

titles and logos for the sequels that would have been made with the titles being gods of mars as the sequel and warlord of mars as the third film on october   it was confirmed that disney had allowed the film rights to the barsoom novels to revert to the edgar rice burroughs estate in november  stanton stated i will always mourn the fact that i didn’t get to make the other two films i planned for
