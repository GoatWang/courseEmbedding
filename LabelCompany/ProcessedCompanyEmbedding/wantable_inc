competitors to determine a companys development stage we count the number of funding rounds and the amount of capital raised we then approximate and visualise a companys value  the bigger its circle the more valuable the company why does it matter the size and number of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed investors use this basic data to take the pulse of a startup among its competitors that aim for the same market several funding rounds and sizable investments are a good gauge of current investors confidence in the market the business and the team ideally youll want to see the startup developing from the lower left corner of the graph to the top right this would signify a gradual rise in both funding and value anomalies such as multiple small funding rounds or few very large funding rounds also warrant closer inspection ok thanks value funderbeam estimate m employee comparison this graph shows staff growth over time if an older company’s balloon still

funding raised why does it matter the size and frequency of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed experienced investors look at the size number and timing of funding rounds in a given industry and estimate the value of a startup as well as the amount of equity that founders have likely surrendered funding reflects investor confidence in the market the business and the team ok thanks valuation funderbeam estimate this graph shows a given startups valuation at different disclosed funding rounds we approximate the postmoney valuation by estimating the value range of the equity stake that the startup may have surrendered to investors in each disclosed funding round why does it matter investors usually want to avoid overpaying for an equity stake in a startup comparing startup valuations in the same industry segment helps you read the mood and maturity of the market investors exit potential etc it also helps you see if a startup prices itself above or below its competitors considering its product development stage etc a startups precise value is impossible to estimate partly because parties rarely disclose the percentage of the company thats surrendered to investors in any given funding round however we can estimate a likely value range based on how startup investments usually work ok thanks relative funding history this graph gives competitors a common starting point making it easier to view their speed of growth in relation to one another ok thanks funding history this graph makes it easy to see and compare the pace of funding among competitors as a rule later rounds mean that a companys business model works this helps to gauge when business in a given sector really took off ok thanks close suggest edits to profile data
