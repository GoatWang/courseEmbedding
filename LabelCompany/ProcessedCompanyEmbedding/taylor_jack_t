word spirit power what happens when you seek all god has to offer by rt kendall charles carrin jack taylor there is a divorce in the church that has rendered it ineffective and powerless but in our efforts to remain busy we havent realized what we are missing we have divorced the word of god from his spirit word spirit power will help us bring about a remarriage of the word and the spirit in todays church word  spirit  power many believe that signs and wonders were ended when the the book of revelation was penned but the truth is we dont experience the signs and wonders because we have separated the scriptures from the power of god to preach the gospel without the power of god behind it we are merely teaching words this coming together of scripture with the power of gods spirit is what gave strength and meaning to peters preaching on the day of pentecost gods power is what lies behind the miraculous and it is the irresistible force behind preaching today many christians are like the sadducees we are ignorant of the scriptures and the power of god we must daily read and study the bible so that when we have need of its guidance and wisdom the holy spirit can bring it our mind the bible is a record of gods integrity and it is through gods name that signs and wonders were done proclaiming the truth of his word even the hymns of today are powerless because there is no theology that we sing unlike those of issac watts and charles wesley when we come to christianity with the attitude of whats in it for me we are missing the point the cross appeased gods wrath at our sinfulness god owes us nothing we must humble ourselves before god and thank him for what he has already given us to return to what god has intended us to be we must pursue the third person of the trinity holy spirit it is only through the holy spirit that we can truly be aware of gods presence in our lives the holy spirit was sent by god to unify the church and to enable us to accomplish the purpose god has created us as the church for but somewhere along the way we seemed to lose our awareness of the spirits presence and began viewing him with fear and doubt to experience true spiritual renewal we must recover the original purpose of the holy spirit todays church lacks the heart and power to recover the glory of the church of acts instead it is under a cloud of oppression struggling to survive this is the time when we should return to god and the bible  a time of spiritual awakening the religious world uses terms that divide and exclude but god wants us to be inclusive as christians we can have disagreements but we must not become disagreeable so that by our very words and actions we cause others to close eyes and ears to god if we refuse the spirit we are refusing god and we are refusing jesus as they are one to be in god we must be in the spirit we must trust him as we trust the father and the son when the spirit came on those first believers of the early church they were filled with a boldness they had not previously had but this was not an offering to only the first believers but to believers today as well we must allow the spirit to provide us with the power by revealing the meaning of gods word to us his children we must not allow our ego or pride to hinder the spirit we must crucify our ego so that we dont handicap the spirits work in our lives and limit our effectiveness both within and without the church we must not allow the legalism of doctrine to cause us to reject the both the spirit and the works of the spirit it is only when the spirit become real to the individual believer that religion is replaced with authentic spirituality and power word spirit power takes an interesting look at the church and what is wrong with it are you willing to to accept the gift that has been given to the church and to the kingdom i received a copy of this book from chosen a division of baker books for the purpose of this review all opinions expressed are my own was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate josi baker city or age  gender female  stars out of  tired of being a boring lifeless christian september   josi baker city or age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  if you could describe your walk with god as shallow unexciting powerless empty or dull then you need to read word spirit power immediately the first chapter rt kendalls selfintroduction is something of a dry start though youll come to appreciate his academic tone if by chance it doesnt grow on you but you long to see the power of god in the church today and in your own life in particular just push through  it will be more than worth it kendall teaches on the importance of knowing gods word while charles carrin teaches out of his unique experience on the importance of understanding the work of the holy spirit and the need for the holy spirit in the christians life jack taylor concludes with the section on power  the outcome of a life lived in the word and in the spirit you will discover each authors reverence for scripture and ability to teach profoundly yet convey the message plainly that bears repeating you dont have to be a seminary student to appreciate the depth of teaching  these men are remarkably good at keeping it simple though each writer shares a good deal from his own experiences this is not a book full of experiential claims loosely supported by random scripture verses it is a challenging thoughtprovoking and humbly presented call to lay down your pride your ego possibly your doctrine and probably the qualifications and preconditions you knowingly or not attach to your prayer for more of god so that you truly can be filled with the lifechanging power of the holy spirit i am convinced that the message in word spirit power could be a catalyst for phenomenal individual and corporate revival if i could i would put this book into the hands of every christian i know and i unreservedly recommend that you read it i am absolutely confident that god will use the message in this book powerfully in your life be warned upon reading it you will find areas of disbelief doubt and pride that you didnt know were there lurking within you as a result you may find yourself on your face before god in repentance and desperation  but can you think of any better place to be i received a complimentary copy of this book for review i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have expressed are my own i am disclosing this in accordance with the federal trade commissions  cfr part  was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate lether chesapeake va age  gender female  stars out of  good source for knowledge of holy spirit august   lether chesapeake va age  gender female quality  value  this book really expands on the importance of not only being equipped with knowledge of the bible but also the importance of being filled with the holy spirit which gives us power to serve god using the gifts that are accessible to us the holy spirit also allows us to hear gods voice feel his love and enables us to live according to gods will when we are obedient to his word seeking what he has to offer the authors give amazing testimonies of their experiences with the holy spirit and how it came to be i really enjoyed reading about the transformation of toms life and how he was used by the holy spirit that demonstrates god is always near and will place people in our lives for a season to fulfill a need truth is in the word power is in the truth and holy spirit is in the power as mentioned in this book really sums it up i believe after reading this book many will pursue the holy spirit it has helped me on my journey thanks bethany house publishing for the opportunity to read this book free of charge was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate the seeking disciple lexington sc age  gender male  stars out of  does give you a hunger for god august   the seeking disciple lexington sc age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  how often have we felt as rt kendall describes in this book theologically sound but powerless this book describes seeking god for the power of the holy spirit the authors are not content to simply teach biblical truths or to be sound in their theology but they want to see the power of god manifested in his church through healings through signs and wonders through the gifts of the spirit like many others they are tired of going through the motions of church and they want to see the living god my thoughts on the book are that the authors do give you a hunger for god i agreed with them that our god is a living god god is not dead he didnt give us the bible and then abandon us he didnt heal people during the ministry of jesus and the book of acts only to leave us with the completion of the new testament i have read articles and books on the cessation of the manifestation gifts of the spirit such as speaking in tongues prophecy or healing and while i agree that there can be abuses of these gifts i find the arguments in favor of their cessation based on a philosophy more than a theology i agreed with the authors that the bible is given to us not to replace the supernatural but to correct abuses of it this was a good point the book focuses on the experiences of the authors and then allows the authors to write short chapters on seeking god and his power what are the weaknesses of the book first while i am not a full cessationist i would call myself a partial cessationist why because i believe the healings of jesus and the apostles were unique to the work of god the healings of jesus for example showed he was the messiah and verified that he was sent from god john   acts  the apostles likewise were able to perform miracles to demonstrate their validity acts  few would claim to be able to do miracles as jesus or the apostles did and few if any would ever claim to be speaking on the same level as god spoke through jesus or the apostles no doubt the lord jesus and the apostles carried a unique authority from god to glorify his name while i agree that all disciples of jesus are now full of the spirit acts  few if any would claim to be speaking on the same level as say paul the apostle or would claim to heal as jesus healed matthew  i have never witnessed a special and unique healing such as raising the dead while i believe god can raise the dead i have never heard of a verified raising of the dead i believe that since the completion of the new testament god is not speaking the same to us as he did through the apostles few other than cults would disagree that said the book does give me a hunger for more of god i truly do believe that god answers prayer i believe he is certainly able to do miracles i believe he longs to hear our cries john  i believe that prayer is powerful not because prayer itself has power but because of the intercessory work of jesus christ who sits at the right hand of god the father hebrews  jesus is our faithful high priest hebrews  and because he is praying for us before the father we can pray and i believe god can do mighty things to exalt his name and his glory in the earth i believe as the authors do that we should pray great and mighty prayers while we do not know the will of god we can know that god does desire to glorify his name ephesians  faith in god can move mountains mark  overall this book will generate a passion for the lord jesus and his presence critics wont find much to wrestle with here except perhaps the experiences of the authors the chapters are given not to theologically show our need for god and his power but to generate a hunger for god i am hungry for god i want him to move in power in my life i want to see souls saved for the glory of god and i want jesus to be exalted in answering our cries truly he is a mighty god was this review
