information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or for an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  the company a maryland corporation is organized as a nondiversified closedend management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a bdc the company is managed by a board of directors “board” currently comprised of five directors three of these directors are not and a majority of the directors at all times will not be “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the act the “noninterested directors”  the private fund a limited partnership under delaware law is managed by fidus advisors applicants state that the private fund would be an investment company but for the exclusion from the definition of investment company provided by section c of the act applicants state that the private funds investment objectives and policies are substantially similar to the objectives and strategies of the company to the extent there is an investment that falls within the objectives and strategies of one or more regulated funds as defined below and the investment strategies of one or more other affiliated funds as defined below the advisers would expect such regulated funds and affiliated funds to coinvest with each other  fidus sbic and fidus sbic ii delaware limited partnerships are sbic start printed page subsidiaries of the company fidus sbic a wholly owned subsidiary of the company has elected to be regulated as a bdc under the act fidus sbic ii is a whollyowned investment sub of the company fidus sbic ii is not registered under the act and would be an investment company but for section c of the act the company may form other sbic subsidiaries in the future  fidus advisors a delaware limited liability company is registered with the commission as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” fidus advisors serves as investment adviser to the company including the assets of fidus sbic fidus sbic ii and the private fund  applicants seek an order “order” to permit one or more regulated funds  andor one or more affiliated funds  to participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed coinvestment program the “coinvestment program” where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section a and rule d by a coinvesting with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which an adviser negotiates terms in addition to price  and b making additional investments in securities of such issuers including through the exercise of warrants conversion privileges and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers “followon investments” “coinvestment transaction” means any transaction in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub participated together with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds in reliance on the requested order “potential coinvestment transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub could not participate together with one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds without obtaining and relying on the order  applicants state that a regulated fund may from time to time form one or more whollyowned investment subs such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with any affiliated fund or regulated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated fund for purposes of section a and rule d applicants request that each whollyowned investment sub be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of its parent regulated fund and that the whollyowned investment subs participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the requested order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated funds investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated funds board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated funds board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub  when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund the applicable adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions capital available for investment “available capital” and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated fund the board of each regulated fund including the noninterested directors has or will have prior to relying on the requested order determined that it is in the best interests of the regulated fund to participate in the coinvestment transaction  other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote under section o of the act “eligible directors” and the “required majority” as defined in section o of start printed page the act “required majority”  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated funds participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated funds eligible directors the board of any regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors  no noninterested director of a regulated fund will have a financial interest in any coinvestment transaction other than through share ownership in one of the regulated funds  if an adviser or its principals or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with an adviser or its principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “holders” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting shares of a regulated fund other than fidus sbic “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on  the election of directors  the removal of one or more directors or  any other matter under either the act or applicable state law affecting the boards composition size or manner of election applicants believe that this will ensure that the noninterested directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of an adviser or its principals to influence the noninterested directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the noninterested directors can be removed will be limited significantly the noninterested directors shall evaluate and approve any such independent third party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section a of the act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a bdc from participating in joint transactions with the bdc or a company controlled by a bdc in contravention of rules as

that each of the regulated funds and affiliated funds could be deemed to be a person related to each regulated fund in a manner described by section b by virtue of being under common control section i of the act provides that until the commission prescribes rules under section a the commissions rules under section d of the act applicable to registered closedend investment companies will be deemed

applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations  the regulated funds however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them   other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote under section o of the act eligible directors and the required majority as defined in section o of page  the act required majority  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund   in the case of a regulated fund that is a registered closedend fund the board members

directors  the removal of one or more directors or  any other matter under either the act or applicable state law affecting the boards composition size or manner of election applicants believe that this will ensure that the non interested directors will act independently in evaluating the co investment program because the ability of an adviser or its principals to influence the noninterested directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the noninterested directors can be removed will be limited significantly the noninterested directors shall evaluate and approve any such independent third party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section a of the act

hrep no  th cong d sess    reprinted in   usccan    applicants believe that the terms and conditions of this application would ensure that the conflicts of interest that section d and section a of the  act were designed to prevent would be addressed and the standards for an order under rule d– under the  act are met   c protection provided by the proposed conditions        applicants believe that the conditions as discussed more fully in section iiid of this application will ensure the protection of shareholders of the regulated funds and compliance with the purposes and policies of the  act with respect to the coinvestment transactions in particular the conditions as outlined below would ensure that each regulated fund would only invest in investments that are appropriate to the interests of shareholders and the investment needs and abilities of that regulated fund in addition each regulated fund would be able to invest on equal footing with each other regulated fund and the affiliated funds including identical terms conditions price class of securities purchased settlement date and registration rights each regulated fund would have the ability to engage in followon investments in a fair manner consistent with the protections of the other conditions each regulated fund would have the ability to participate on a proportionate basis at the same price and on the same terms and conditions in any sale of a security purchased in a coinvestment transaction fees and expenses of coinvestment transactions would be borne by the applicable adviser or shared prorata among the regulated funds and affiliated funds who participate in the coinvestment transactions the conditions would also prevent a regulated fund from investing in any current investments of an affiliated person which eliminates the possibility of a regulated fund from being forced to invest in a manner that would benefit an affiliated person’s existing investment also sufficient records of the transactions would be maintained to permit the examination staff of the commission to monitor compliance with the terms of the requested order         the conditions impose a variety of duties on the advisers with respect to coinvestment transactions and potential coinvestment transactions by the regulated funds these duties include determinations regarding investment appropriateness the appropriate level of investment and the provision of information to the board of any regulated fund in addition when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund the applicable adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions available capital defined below and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated fund each adviser as applicable undertakes to perform these duties consistently for each regulated fund as applicable regardless of which of them serves as investment adviser to these entities the participation of a regulated fund in a potential coinvestment transaction may only be approved by a required majority as defined in section o a “ required majority ” of the directors of the board eligible to vote on that coinvestment transaction under section o the “ eligible directors ”          the amount of each regulated fund’s capital available for investment “ available capital ” will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time to time by the board of the applicable regulated fund or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations likewise an affiliated fund’s capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the affiliated fund’s directors general partners or adviser or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations     in the case of a regulated fund that is a registered closedend fund the board members that make up the required majority will be determined as if the regulated fund were a bdc subject to section o                 if an adviser or its principals or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with an adviser or its principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “ holders ” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting shares of a regulated fund the “ shares ” then the holders will vote such shares as required under condition                 applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the noninterested directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of an adviser or its principals to influence the noninterested directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the noninterested directors can be removed will be limited significantly the noninterested directors shall evaluate and approve any such independent party taking into accounts its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant        in sum the applicants believe that the proposed conditions would ensure that each regulated fund that participates in a coinvestment transaction does not participate on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participants as a result the applicants believe that the participation of the regulated funds in coinvestment transactions done in accordance with the conditions would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and would be done in a manner that was not different from or less advantageous than the other participants        with respect to each whollyowned investment sub such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with an affiliated fund or regulated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated fund for purposes of section a of the  act and rule dl under the  act applicants request that each whollyowned investment sub be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of its parent regulated fund and that the whollyowned investment sub’s participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated fund’s investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated fund’s board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment sub’s participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated fund’s board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated fund’s place if the regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub   d proposed conditions        applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions    each time an adviser considers a potential coinvestment transaction for an affiliated fund or another regulated fund that falls within a regulated fund’s thencurrent objectives and strategies the regulated fund’s adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for such regulated fund in light of the regulated fund’s thencurrent circumstances    a if the adviser deems a regulated fund’s participation in any potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate for the regulated fund it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the regulated fund   b if the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable adviser to be invested by the applicable regulated fund in the potential coinvestment transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating regulated funds and affiliated funds collectively in the same transaction exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant’s available capital up to the amount proposed to be invested by each the applicable adviser will provide the eligible directors of each participating regulated fund with information concerning each participating party’s available capital to assist the eligible directors with their review of the regulated fund’s investments for compliance with these allocation procedures         c after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the applicable adviser will distribute written information concerning the potential coinvestment transaction including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating regulated fund and affiliated fund to the eligible directors of each participating regulated fund for their consideration a regulated fund will coinvest with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds only if prior to the regulated fund’s participation in the potential coinvestment transaction a required majority concludes that   i the terms of the potential coinvestment transaction including the consideration to be paid are reasonable and fair to the regulated fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the regulated fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned   ii the potential coinvestment transaction is consistent with   a the interests of the shareholders of the regulated fund and   b the regulated fund’s thencurrent objectives and strategies   iii the investment by any other regulated funds or affiliated funds would

that  if any other regulated fund or affiliated fund but not the regulated fund itself gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the required majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition ciii if   a the eligible directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer if any   b the applicable adviser agrees to and does provide periodic reports to the regulated fund’s board with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company and   c any fees or other compensation that any affiliated fund or any regulated fund or any affiliated person of any affiliated fund or any regulated fund receives in connection with the right of the affiliated fund or a regulated fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating affiliated funds who each may in turn share its portion with its affiliated persons and the participating regulated funds in accordance with the amount of each party’s investment and   iv the proposed investment by the regulated fund will not benefit the advisers the affiliated funds or the other regulated funds or any affiliated person of any of them other than the parties to the coinvestment transaction except a to the extent permitted by condition  b to the extent permitted by section e or k of the  act as applicable c indirectly as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the coinvestment transaction or d in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition ciiic    each regulated fund has the right to decline to participate in any potential coinvestment transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed     the applicable adviser will present to the board of each regulated fund on a quarterly basis a record of all investments in potential coinvestment transactions made by any of the other regulated funds or affiliated funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the regulated fund’s thencurrent objectives and strategies that were not made available to the regulated fund and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the regulated fund all information presented to the board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the regulated fund

directors of each regulated fund will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning potential coinvestment transactions and coinvestment transactions including investments made by other regulated funds or affiliated funds that the regulated fund considered but declined to participate in so that the noninterested directors may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter including those investments that the regulated fund considered but declined to participate in comply with the conditions of the order in addition the noninterested directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the regulated fund of participating in new and existing coinvestment transactions    each regulated fund will maintain the records required

no noninterested director of a regulated fund will also be a director general partner managing member or principal or otherwise an “affiliated person” as defined in the  act of an affiliated fund    the expenses if any associated with acquiring holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a coinvestment transaction including without limitation the expenses of the distribution of any such

including breakup or commitment fees but excluding broker’s fees contemplated by section e or k of the  act as applicable received in connection with a coinvestment transaction will be distributed to the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed as the case may be in such coinvestment transaction if any transaction fee is to be held by an adviser pending consummation of the transaction the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by such adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in section a of the  act and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds based on the amounts they

coinvestment transaction    on march   fidus sbic filed its registration statement on form n with the commission as a coregistrant with the company on its registration statement on form n as a result of the company’s initial public offering and a series of related transactions fidus sbic could be deemed to fail to meet the requirements for exclusion from the definition of an investment company set forth in  section c by reason of subparagraph a of section c and  section c by virtue of its failure to qualify as a “qualified purchaser” within the meaning of section a by virtue of rule aa of the  act as the company could be deemed to have been formed for the purpose of investing in fidus sbic accordingly on june   fidus sbic filed an election to be regulated as a bdc   the fidus sbic board will consider all potential coinvestment transactions in accordance with the conditions           election of directors  the removal of one or more directors or  any other matter under either the  act or applicable state law affecting the board’s composition size or manner of election   iv statement in support of relief requested        applicants submit that allowing the coinvestment transactions described by this application is justified on the basis of i the potential benefits to the regulated funds and the shareholders thereof and ii the protections found in the terms and conditions set forth in this application   a potential benefits        in the absence of the relief sought hereby in some circumstances the regulated funds would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities section d and section a of the  act and rule d– under the  act should not prevent bdcs and registered closed–end investment companies from making investments that are in the best interests of their shareholders        in cases where the advisers identify investment opportunities requiring larger capital commitments they must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles the ability to participate in coinvestment transactions that involve committing larger amounts of financing would enable each regulated fund to participate with one or more of the affiliated funds and the other regulated funds in larger financing commitments which would in turn be expected to obtain discounted prices and increase income expand investment opportunities and provide better access to due diligence information for the regulated funds indeed each regulated fund’s inability to coinvest with one or more of the affiliated funds and the other regulated funds could potentially result in the loss of beneficial investment opportunities for such regulated fund and in turn adversely affect such regulated fund’s shareholders for example a regulated fund may lose investment opportunities if the adviser cannot provide “onestop” financing to a potential portfolio company portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by an adviser due to a regulated fund’s inability to commit the full amount of financing required by the portfolio company in a timely manner ie without the delay that typically would be associated with obtaining singletransaction exemptive relief from the commission the regulated fund advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification the regulated funds however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them        each regulated fund and its shareholders will benefit from the ability to participate in coinvestment transactions the board of each regulated fund including the noninterested directors has or will have prior to relying on the requested order determined that it is in the best interests of the regulated fund to participate in coinvestment transactions because among other matters i the regulated fund will be able to participate in a larger number and greater variety of transactions ii the regulated fund will be able to participate in larger transactions iii the regulated fund will be able to participate in all opportunities approved by a required majority or otherwise permissible under the order rather than risk underperformance through rotational allocation of opportunities among the regulated funds iv the regulated fund and any other regulated funds participating in the proposed investment will have greater bargaining power more control over the investment and less need to bring in other external investors or structure investments to satisfy the different needs of external investors v the regulated fund will be able to obtain greater attention and better deal flow from investment bankers and others who act as sources of investments and vi the general terms and conditions of the proposed order are fair to the regulated funds and their shareholders the company’s board including the noninterested directors also determined that it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to obtain the order at the earliest possible time and instructed the officers of the company the advisers and counsel to use all appropriate efforts to accomplish such goal for these reasons the board has determined or will have prior to relying on the requested order that is proper and desirable             for the company to participate in coinvestment transactions with the other regulated funds andor one more affiliated funds   b protective representations and conditions        the terms and conditions set forth in this application ensure that the proposed coinvestment transactions are consistent with the protection of each regulated fund’s shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the  act specifically the conditions incorporate the following critical protections i in each coinvestment transaction all regulated funds and affiliated funds participating in the coinvestment transactions will invest at the same time for the same price and with the same terms conditions class registration rights and any other rights so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other ii a required majority of each regulated fund must approve various investment decisions with respect to such regulated fund in accordance with the conditions and iii the regulated funds are required to retain and maintain certain records        other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the eligible directors and the required majority will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated fund’s participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated fund’s eligible directors the board of any regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors        the applicants believe that participation by the regulated funds in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants a formulaic approach such as pro rata dispositions and followon investments eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation determinations and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness the applicants note that the commission has adopted a similar pro rata approach in the context of rule c under the  act which relates to the redemption by a closedend investment company of less than all of a class of its securities indicating the general fairness and lack of overreaching that such approach provides        the foregoing analysis applies equally where a whollyowned investment sub is involved in a coinvestment transaction as each whollyowned investment sub will be treated as
