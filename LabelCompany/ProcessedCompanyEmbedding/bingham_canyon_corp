among locals is an openpit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of salt lake city utah in the oquirrh mountains the mine is the largest manmade excavation in the world and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than  million tonnes the mine is owned by rio tinto group a britishaustralian multinational corporation the copper operations at bingham canyon mine are managed through kennecott utah copper corporation which operates the mine a concentrator plant a smelter and a refinery the mine has been in production since  and has resulted in the creation of a pit over  miles  m deep  miles  km wide and covering  acres  ha it was designated a national historic landmark in  under the name bingham canyon open pit copper mine

 by two brothers sanford and thomas bingham sons of erastus bingham mormon pioneers of september  who grazed their cattle there they reported their find to their leader brigham young who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time the brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim in  the bingham family went to settle what is now weber county leaving the canyon still today known by their name bingham canyon mine november  carr fork canyon as seen from g bridge it was not until  sept  that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyons mineral resources began to be widely recognized that was when george b ogilvie and  others located the west jordan claim soon followed by the vidette claim at first mining was confined to placer gold leadsilver and coppergold porphyry copper required processing and a railroad which reached the canyon in – enos andrew wall started working claims in  his extensive tunnels and test pits on his  acres indicated ore containing  copper– the canyons th century mines were relatively small and it wasnt until the end of the century that very largescale exploitation of the canyons ore bodies began to develop with openpit mining in  samuel newhouse and thomas weir acquired the highland boy mine which was rich in copper silver and gold together they formed the utah consolidated gold mines ltd with english investors they then formed the boston consolidated gold and copper co ltd for development of lowgrade copper ore adjacent to the utah copper company site– another significant development took place in  when daniel c jackling and enos a wall organized the utah copper company utah copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at copperton just beyond the mouth of the canyon and the company actually started mining in  the success of utah copper in mining the huge but lowgrade porphyry copper type ore body at bingham canyon was based on jacklins  decision to use openpit mining steam shovels and the railroad the mine became a showplace for railroadpit operations and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the asarco smelting operation made it the largest industrial mining complex in the world by – utah copper and boston consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in  the kennecott copper corporation established to operate mines in kennecott alaska purchased a  percent financial interest in utah copper in  which they increased to  percent in  binghams canyon mine expanded rapidly and by the s the region was a beehive of activity some  people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls the population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the everexpanding mine by  when lark was dismantled only copperton at the mouth of bingham canyon and with a population of  remained the  separate mining operations in existence by  were consolidated into two in  kennecott and the anaconda minerals company in  openpit mining operations were halted by kennecotts utah copper in  kennecott discovered gold in nearby barneys canyon kcc was purchased by sohio in  and the mine reopened in  after bp minerals purchased the assets in  the rio tinto group acquired the asset who modernized the mine mill and smelter the openpit owners replaced an antiquated car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste which reduced costs by nearly  and returned the operation to profitability landslidesedit bingham canyon mine satellite images before left july   and after right may   a landslide on april   at  pm on april   a landslide occurred at the mine it was the largest nonvolcanic landslide in the history of north america around – million cubic meters ×–× cu ft of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit understanding that the mines steep walls made it a high risk for landslides an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the grounds stability as a result of warnings produced by this system mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide there were no injuries the massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by  tonnes  short tons a second slide caused an evacuation of  workers on september   environmental historyedit according to environmental specialists the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution creating health hazards to the surrounding public different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations since the early s kennecott has spent more than  million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the superfund national priorities list npl the figure below shows a comparison of two satellite images used to identify the changes in the bingham canyon mine between  and    geologyedit crosssection through open pit showing ore zonation geologic map showing bedrock geology and alteration zones usgs the bingham canyon ore deposits occur in the bingham nappe they are a porphyry copper deposit formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks they exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the bingham stock these zones include a central core containing magnetite followed by a molybdenite zone low in copper a bornitechalcopyritegold higher grade copper zone a pyritechalcopyrite zone a pyrite zone and an outermost leadzinc zoneee structurally late paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the precambrian craton during the cretaceous sevier orogeny these rocks were later intruded and altered in the tertiary by granitoid rocks this igneous event was the source of deposition of gold silver and other base metalse copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns the main stratigraphic rocks in bingham canyon are upper pennsylvanian sandstones quartzites and limestones known as the bingham mine formation in the oquirrh group the central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed recovery processedit the extracted ore is treated at the kennecott smelter at nearby magna utah the ore is run through a concentrator where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles which float off as a percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver gold lead molybdenum platinum and palladium a selective flotation step separates the molybdenite molybdenum disulfide from the chalcopyrite the filtered concentrate slurry is piped  miles  km to the smelter where it is dried and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur the oxidized iron is skimmed off while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an onsite acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid  a million tons of it each year left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte the percentcopper matte is waterquenched to form a sandlike solid then injected with oxygen into a flashconverting furnace that produces molten percentpure copper this copper is then cast into pound  kg anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery at the refinery the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte when the cells are electrified the anodes slowly dissolve freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as percentpure copper impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes a chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver which is melted in

voluntarily cleaning up the contaminated lands the socalled superfund alternative approach the listing proposal was withdrawn in  more than  million tons of mining wastes have been removed sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on sitecitation needed –edit by  there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the salt lake valley the sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops during the  winter the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the united states district court of utah in  federal court judge marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than  sulfur effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters panorama of the mines of the utah copper company and the boston consolidated mining company in  –edit kennecott copper mines was formed in  after a merger of utah copper and kennecott copper mining companies by  environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization kennecott corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis skin warts and lung cancer kennecott corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury by  arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against kennecott corporation both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities –edit chemical spills  year amount substance

state of utah proceeded with legal action against kennecott and filed a damage claim against the mine in october  for the loss and destruction of the natural resources specifically the groundwater there was also a threat due to the tailings dam an engineering report in march  gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billionton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed the mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed investing  million to reinforce the embankment and colluding with state regulators to keep the

canyon ranch in the southern oquirrh mountains and yellow fork canyon land in salt lake county kennecott claims rights to file a mining claim in accordance with the stockraising homestead act of  in  the united states department of interior fish and wildlife service sued kennecott after the release of hazardous substances including selenium copper arsenic zinc lead and cadmium a federal biologist claimed that these chemicals have caused great damage to the ecosystems and resources that support the migrant bird populations as well as other fish and wildlife habitats in the northern zone near

expansion project tep to expand the tailings pond impoundment in magna which is already at  billion ton capacity and to expand on  new acres of wetlands south of the great salt lake the company has come under scrutiny for the instability of the structure the salt lake tribune published a report in  revealing that the company failed to disclose information on possible damages that could occur if

utah copper and kennecott copper mining companies by  environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization kennecott corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis skin warts and lung cancer kennecott corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury by

magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billionton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed the mine responded by proposing various

openpit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of salt lake city utah in the oquirrh mountains the mine is the largest manmade excavation in the world and is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than  million tonnes the mine is owned by rio tinto group a britishaustralian multinational corporation the copper operations at bingham canyon mine are managed through kennecott utah copper corporation which operates the mine a concentrator plant a smelter and a refinery the mine has been in production since  and has resulted in the creation of a pit over  miles  m deep  miles  km wide and covering  acres  ha it was designated a national historic landmark in  under the name bingham canyon open pit copper mine the mine

brothers sanford and thomas bingham sons of erastus bingham mormon pioneers of september  who grazed their cattle there they reported their find to their leader brigham young who advised against pursuing mining operations because the survival and establishment of settlements was of paramount importance at that time the brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim in  the bingham family went to settle what is now weber county leaving the canyon still today known by their name bingham canyon mine november  carr fork canyon as seen from g bridge it was not until  sept  that extraction of ore began and the potential of the canyons mineral resources began to be widely recognized that was when george b ogilvie and  others located the west jordan claim soon followed by the vidette claim at first mining was confined to placer gold leadsilver and coppergold porphyry copper required processing and a railroad which reached the canyon in – enos andrew wall started working claims in  his extensive tunnels and test pits on his  acres indicated ore containing  copper– the canyons th century mines were relatively small and it wasnt until the end of the century that very largescale exploitation of the canyons ore bodies began to develop with openpit mining in  samuel newhouse and thomas weir acquired the highland boy mine which was rich in copper silver and gold together they formed the utah consolidated gold mines ltd with english investors they then formed the boston consolidated gold and copper co ltd for development of lowgrade copper ore adjacent to the utah copper company site– another significant development took place in  when daniel c jackling and enos a wall organized the utah copper company utah copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at copperton just beyond the mouth of the canyon and the company actually started mining in  the success of utah copper in mining the huge but lowgrade porphyry copper type ore body at bingham canyon was based on jacklins  decision to use openpit mining steam shovels and the railroad the mine became a showplace for railroadpit operations and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the asarco smelting operation made it the largest industrial mining complex in the world by – utah copper and boston consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in  the kennecott copper corporation established to operate mines in kennecott alaska purchased a  percent financial interest in utah copper in  which they increased to  percent in  binghams canyon mine expanded rapidly and by the s the region was a beehive of activity some  people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls the population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the everexpanding mine by  when lark was dismantled only copperton at the mouth of bingham canyon and with a population of  remained the  separate mining operations in existence by  were consolidated into two in  kennecott and the anaconda minerals company in  openpit mining operations were halted by kennecotts utah copper in  kennecott discovered gold in nearby barneys canyon kcc was purchased by sohio in  and the mine reopened in  after bp minerals purchased the assets in  the rio tinto group acquired the asset who modernized the mine mill and smelter the openpit owners replaced an antiquated car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste which reduced costs by nearly  and returned the operation to profitability landslidesedit bingham canyon mine satellite images before left july   and after right may   a landslide on april   at  pm on april   a landslide occurred at the mine it was the largest nonvolcanic landslide in the history of north america around – million cubic meters ×–× cu ft of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit understanding that the mines steep walls made it a high risk for landslides an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the grounds stability as a result of warnings produced by this system mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide there were no injuries the massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by  tonnes  short tons a second slide caused an evacuation of  workers on september   environmental historyedit according to environmental specialists the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution creating health hazards to the surrounding public different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations since the early s kennecott has spent more than  million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the superfund national priorities list npl the figure below shows a comparison of two

alteration zones usgs the bingham canyon ore deposits occur in the bingham nappe they are a porphyry copper deposit formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks they exhibit a

bornitechalcopyritegold higher grade copper zone a pyritechalcopyrite zone a pyrite zone and an outermost leadzinc zoneee structurally late paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the precambrian craton during the cretaceous sevier orogeny these rocks were later intruded and altered in the tertiary by granitoid rocks this igneous event was the source of deposition of gold silver and other base metalse copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns the main stratigraphic rocks in bingham canyon are upper pennsylvanian sandstones quartzites and limestones known as the bingham mine formation in the oquirrh group the central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed recovery processedit the extracted ore is treated at the kennecott smelter at nearby magna utah the ore is run through a concentrator where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles which float off as a percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver gold lead molybdenum platinum and palladium a selective flotation step separates the molybdenite molybdenum disulfide from the chalcopyrite the filtered concentrate slurry is piped  miles  km to the smelter where it is dried and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur the

copper required processing and a railroad which reached the canyon in – enos andrew wall started working claims in  his extensive tunnels and test pits on his  acres indicated ore containing  copper– the canyons th century mines were relatively small and it wasnt until the end of the century that very largescale exploitation of the canyons ore bodies began to develop with openpit mining in  samuel newhouse and thomas weir acquired the highland boy mine which was rich in copper silver and gold together they formed the utah consolidated gold mines ltd with english investors they then formed the boston consolidated gold and copper co ltd for development of lowgrade copper ore adjacent to the utah copper company site– another significant development took place in  when daniel c jackling and enos a wall organized the utah copper company utah copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at copperton just beyond the mouth of the canyon and the company actually started mining in  the success of utah copper in mining the huge but lowgrade porphyry copper type ore body at bingham canyon was based on jacklins  decision to use openpit mining steam shovels and the railroad the mine became a showplace for railroadpit operations and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the asarco smelting operation made it the largest industrial mining complex in the world by – utah

landslide in the history of north america around – million cubic meters ×–× cu ft of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit understanding that the mines steep walls made it a high risk for landslides an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the grounds stability as a result of warnings produced by this system mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide there were no injuries the massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by  tonnes  short tons a second slide caused an evacuation of  workers on september   environmental historyedit according to environmental specialists the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution creating health hazards to the surrounding public different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations since the early s kennecott has spent more than  million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the superfund national priorities list npl the figure below shows a comparison of two satellite images used to identify the changes in the bingham canyon mine between  and    geologyedit crosssection through open pit showing ore zonation geologic map showing bedrock geology and alteration zones usgs the bingham canyon ore deposits occur in the bingham nappe they are a porphyry copper deposit formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks they exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the bingham stock these zones include a central core containing magnetite followed by a molybdenite zone low in copper a bornitechalcopyritegold higher grade copper zone a pyritechalcopyrite zone a pyrite zone and an outermost leadzinc zoneee structurally late paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the precambrian craton during the cretaceous sevier orogeny these rocks were later intruded and altered in the tertiary by granitoid rocks this igneous event was the source of deposition of gold silver and other base metalse copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns the main stratigraphic rocks in bingham canyon are upper pennsylvanian sandstones quartzites and limestones known as the bingham mine formation in the oquirrh group the central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed recovery processedit the extracted ore is treated at the kennecott smelter at nearby magna utah the ore is run through a concentrator where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles which float off as a percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver gold lead molybdenum platinum and palladium a selective flotation step separates the molybdenite molybdenum disulfide from the chalcopyrite the filtered concentrate slurry is piped  miles  km to the smelter where it is dried and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur the oxidized iron is skimmed off while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an onsite acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid  a

using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis skin warts and lung cancer kennecott corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury by

potential of the canyons mineral resources began to be widely recognized that was when george b ogilvie and  others located the west jordan claim soon followed by the vidette claim at first mining was confined to placer gold leadsilver and coppergold porphyry copper required processing and a railroad which reached the canyon in – enos andrew wall started working claims in  his extensive tunnels and test pits on his  acres indicated ore containing  copper– the canyons th century mines were relatively small and it wasnt until the end of the century that very largescale exploitation of the canyons ore bodies began to develop with openpit mining in  samuel newhouse and thomas weir acquired the highland boy mine which was rich in copper silver and gold together they formed the utah consolidated gold mines ltd with english investors they then formed the boston consolidated gold and copper co ltd for development of lowgrade copper ore adjacent to the utah copper company site– another significant development took place in  when daniel c jackling and enos a wall organized the utah copper company utah copper immediately began construction of a pilot mill at copperton just beyond the mouth of the canyon and the company actually started mining in  the success of utah copper in mining the huge but lowgrade porphyry copper type ore body at bingham canyon was based on jacklins  decision to use openpit mining steam shovels and the railroad the mine became a showplace for railroadpit operations and the industrial complex defined by the mine and the asarco smelting operation made it the largest industrial mining complex in the world by – utah copper and boston consolidated merged after their separate surface operations approached each other in  the kennecott copper corporation established to operate mines in kennecott alaska purchased a  percent financial interest in utah copper in  which they increased to  percent in  binghams canyon mine expanded rapidly and by the s the region was a beehive of activity some  people of widely varying ethnicity lived in the canyon in large residential communities constructed on the steep canyon walls the population declined rapidly as mining techniques improved and several of the mining camps were swallowed up by the everexpanding mine by  when lark was dismantled only copperton at the mouth of bingham canyon and with a population of  remained the  separate mining operations in existence by  were consolidated into two in  kennecott and the anaconda minerals company in  openpit mining operations were halted by kennecotts utah copper in  kennecott discovered gold in nearby barneys canyon kcc was purchased by sohio in  and the mine reopened in  after bp minerals purchased the assets in  the rio tinto group acquired the asset who modernized the mine mill and smelter the openpit owners replaced an antiquated car railroad with conveyor belts and pipelines for transporting the ore and waste which reduced costs by nearly  and returned the operation to profitability landslidesedit bingham canyon mine satellite images before left july   and after right may   a landslide on april   at  pm on april   a landslide occurred at the mine it was the largest nonvolcanic landslide in the history of north america around – million cubic meters ×–× cu ft of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit understanding that the mines steep walls made it a high risk for landslides an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the grounds stability as a result of warnings produced by this system mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide there were no injuries the massive slide is expected to cut production of mined copper by  tonnes  short tons a second slide caused an evacuation of  workers on september   environmental historyedit according to environmental specialists the mine has had adverse environmental effects on the habitats of fish and wild animals as well as air and water pollution creating health hazards to the surrounding public different federal agencies concerned with environmental conservation have used strict legal rules to pressure the subsidiary of kennecott copper mine to comply with environmental regulations since the early s kennecott has spent more than  million on clean up efforts on the affected areas to avoid regulatory laws that would have placed them on the superfund national priorities list npl the figure below shows a comparison of two satellite images used to identify the changes in the bingham canyon mine between  and    geologyedit crosssection through open pit showing ore zonation geologic map showing bedrock geology and alteration zones usgs the bingham canyon ore deposits occur in the bingham nappe they are a porphyry copper deposit formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks they exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the bingham stock these zones include a central core containing magnetite followed by a molybdenite zone low in copper a bornitechalcopyritegold higher grade copper zone a pyritechalcopyrite zone a pyrite zone and an outermost leadzinc zoneee structurally late paleozoic rocks were thrust faulted over the precambrian craton during the cretaceous sevier orogeny these rocks were later intruded and altered in the tertiary by granitoid rocks this igneous event was the source of deposition of gold silver and other base metalse copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded stock and in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns the main stratigraphic rocks in bingham canyon are upper pennsylvanian sandstones quartzites and limestones known as the bingham mine formation in the oquirrh group the central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed recovery processedit the extracted ore is treated at the kennecott smelter at nearby magna utah the ore is run through a concentrator where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles which float off as a percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver gold lead molybdenum platinum and palladium a selective flotation step separates the molybdenite molybdenum disulfide from the chalcopyrite the filtered concentrate slurry is piped  miles  km to the smelter where it is dried and then injected along with oxygen into a flash smelting furnace to oxidize the iron and sulfur the oxidized iron is skimmed off while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an onsite acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid  a million tons of it each year left behind is a molten copper sulfide called matte the percentcopper matte is waterquenched to form a sandlike solid then injected with oxygen into a flashconverting furnace that produces molten percentpure copper this copper is then cast into pound  kg anode plates and shipped by rail to the refinery at the refinery the anode plates are pressed flat and interleaved with stainless steel cathode blanks automated robotic vehicles place the prepared anodes in cells containing an acidic electrolyte when the cells are electrified the anodes slowly dissolve freeing copper ions that are deposited on the cathode as percentpure copper impurities and precious metals settle to the bottom of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes a chlorination leaching process recovers the gold and silver which is melted in induction furnaces operationsedit utah copper co mill bingham canyon circa

superfund alternative approach the listing proposal was withdrawn in  more than  million tons of mining wastes have been removed sludge with elevated sulfate concentrations was consolidated and capped on sitecitation needed –edit by  there were three large copper smelters and one lead smelter in the salt lake valley the sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops during the  winter the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the united states district court of utah in  federal court judge marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than  sulfur effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters panorama of the mines of the utah copper company and the boston consolidated mining company in  –edit kennecott copper mines was formed in  after a merger of utah copper and kennecott copper mining companies by  environmental protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos being used in the organization kennecott corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis skin warts and lung cancer kennecott corporation was also cited as contributing to emissions of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury by  arsenic and mercury were also some of the concerns that were raised by environmental protection agencies against kennecott corporation both mercury and arsenic are dangerous to health in large quantities –edit chemical spills  year amount substance released cause   gal est process water

tailings dam an engineering report in march  gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billionton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed the mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond

mining for modern life the metals and minerals rio tinto kennecott produces are essential for modern life whether it’s the cars we drive or the mobile devices we use daily most of the items that we rely on for modern living are made from the products we mine the next time you use a smart phone to text or talk to your family and friends remember that copper is a vital component that makes your communication possible copper copper plays a vital role in many branches of modern society and technology copper’s ductility led to its use in contemporary plumbing and heating systems its corrosion resistance makes it an excellent roofing material for buildings its electrical conductivity remains the key to modern power generation and distribution copper is  percent recyclable and retains its quality its chemical or physical properties when recycled to date it is one of the most recycled metals in the united states nearly as much copper is recovered from recycled material as is derived from newly mined ore production at rio tinto kennecott we extract ore from the bingham canyon mine by blasting with explosives massive trucks carry the ore to a crusher that breaks the rock into pieces less than  inches in diameter the crushed ore then travels five miles by conveyer belt to the concentrator there we mix the ore with an aqueous solution and grind it into a fine powder we then mix the ore powder with water chemicals and air in flotation cells this process causes the copperbearing minerals to stick to air bubbles in the cells when the bubbles float off the top we collect them as a liquid concentrate that is  percent copper the concentrate travels  miles to kennecott’s smelter we dry it and send it into a flashsmelting furnace which separates it into several products including a copper matte that is  percent copper after the copper matte cools we feed it into several furnaces that remove most of the remaining impurities achieving  percent purity we then cast the copper into pound anodes we place the anodes in an acid solution interleaved with stainless steel cathodes for  days an electric current passes between the anode and the cathode causing the copper

precious metals gold gold along with copper was one of the first metals discovered by human beings throughout history gold has been the most highly sought after precious metal a wide range of electronic space aeronautics and medical applications contain gold due to its high conductivity complete reflectivity and absolute resistance to corrosion and oxidation in addition space vehicles integrate goldcoated film to reflect infrared radiation and stabilize the temperature of the spacecraft gold is  percent recyclable today about  percent of gold consumption is recycled annually silver silver’s superior and unique properties make it an indispensable and highly desirable metal of all metals silver is the best electrical conductor it is beautiful and strong sensitive to light malleable and ductile reflective and  percent recyclable silver has superior conductivity even when tarnished and can endure extreme temperature changes because silver can achieve the highest brilliance of any metal when polished and because of its durability silver has been used to make coins jewelry dinnerware ornaments and medals since ancient times production gold and silver are products of the copper mining and smelting process they follow the same production pathway as our copper ore from the mine to the smelter at the refinery we lower copper anodes which contain gold and silver into an acid solution gold and silver drop off into the bottom of the tank as electrolytic slimes we send these slimes to the precious metals plant where we separate the gold from the silver

smelting process we deliver sulfuric acid to gold copper uranium and beryllium metal producers fertilizer producers chemical manufacturers power plants steel companies farmers and companies involved in water treatment across the united states production many of the worlds most important metal ore bodies are sulfides — that is mineral compounds that contain sulfur the bingham canyon mine contains veins of copper sulfide so the ore extracted contains sulfur which needs to be separated from the copper we upgrade ore from the mine to produce copper concentrate using a flotation process the copper concentrate entering the smelter is about onethird copper onethird iron and onethird sulfur with other trace minerals the smelting process breaks the elements apart and the sulfur is driven off as

significant accounting policies   the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of bingham canyon corporation the “company” have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and reflect all adjustments which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation of our balance sheet statements of operations and cash flows for the periods presented all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature  the results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year     certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been condensed or omitted it is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the company’s december   audited financial statements as reported in its form k filed on april     nature of operations on august   the company entered into a securities exchange agreement with paradigm convergence technologies corporation “paradigm” to effect the acquisition of paradigm as a whollyowned subsidiary under the terms of the agreement bingham issued  restricted common shares of bingham stock to the shareholders of paradigm in exchange for all  outstanding common shares of paradigm stock in addition bingham issued options exercisable into  shares of bingham’s common stock with exercise prices ranging between  and  in exchange for  outstanding paradigm stock options with exercise prices ranging between  and  these  options have been adjusted at the same exchange rate of  that the outstanding common shares were exchanged as a result of this share exchange agreement paradigm the operating company is considered the accounting acquirer   paradigm is located in lenexa kansas and was formed june   under the name of eureca ltd paradigm also leases office research and development and production space in little river south carolina paradigm is a technology licensing company specializing in environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability paradigm holds patent intellectual property andor distribution rights to innovative products and technologies paradigm provides innovative products and technologies for eliminating biocidal contamination from water supplies industrial fluids hard surfaces food processing equipment and medical devices paradigm’s overall strategy is to market new products and technologies through the use of equipment leasing joint ventures licensing distributor agreements and partnerships   principles of consolidations the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bingham canyon corporation “parent” and its wholly owned subsidiary paradigm convergence technologies corporation “paradigm” or “subsidiary” all intercompany accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation   use of estimates the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods estimates are based on historical experience and on various other marketspecific and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ materially from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash and highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less there was cash of  and  as of march   and december   respectively there were no cash equivalents as of march   and december   respectively          accounts receivable accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts the company provides allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable equal to the estimated collection losses that will be incurred in collection of all receivables accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition the company’s management determines which accounts are past due and if deemed uncollectible the company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables in the period the determination is made based on management’s evaluation the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at march   and december   respectively   inventory the inventory consists of raw materials  and finished goods  in the amount of  at march   inventory is valued using the firstin firstout “fifo” method at the lower of cost or market value the company recorded a reserve allowance against inventory of  and  for the periods ending march   and december   respectively   fair value measurements the company follows asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable is used to measure fair value     level  valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active markets from readily available pricing sources such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         level  observable inputs other than level  quoted prices such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data         level  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities including pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques   the carrying values of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventory prepaid expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments we do not have other financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of march   and december     valuation of longlived assets the carrying values of the company’s longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable when projections indicate that the carrying value of the longlived asset is not recoverable the carrying value is reduced by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the projected undiscounted cash flows under similar analysis no impairment was recorded as of march   and december   impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis and should they indicate a carrying value in excess of fair value additional impairment changes may be required          property and equipment property and equipment are stated at purchased cost and depreciated on a straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from  to  years upon disposition of property and equipment related gains and losses are recorded in the results of operations accumulated depreciation for period ending march   and december   were  and  respectively expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses as incurred   intangible assets costs to obtain or develop patents are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the patents and technology rights are amortized over their estimated useful lives these assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortization an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible assets as determined by the projected undiscounted net future cash flows the company recorded impairment expense of  and  for the periods ending march   and december   respectively accumulated amortization was  and  as of march   and december   respectively   research and development research and development costs are recognized as an expense during the period incurred which is until the conceptual formulation design and testing of the process is completed and the process has been determined to be commercially viable   revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists services have been provided or goods delivered the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue from the sale of products is recorded at the time of shipment to the customers revenue from contracts to license technology to others is immediately recognized since it is a nonrefundable deposit   basic and diluted loss per share basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weightedaverage number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for computing basic eps was  at march   as compared to  at march   at march   and march   there were  and  common stock equivalents from stock options that were excluded from the diluted eps calculation as their effect is antidilutive   recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued asu  stock compensation” asu  was issued to simplify the accounting for stock compensation it focuses on income tax accounting award classification estimating forfeitures and cash flow presentation for public companies asu  became effective for annual periods beginning after december   and for interim periods within those annual periods the company adopted asu  effective january   asu  has no material effect on the company’s financial statements   in january  the fasb issued asu  “intangibles goodwill  other” asu  simplifies how all entities assess impairment by implementing a one step test as amended the impairment test will compare the fair value with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value a public company which is a securities and exchange commission sec filer should adopt the amendments in asu  for its annual or any interim period within its annual period in fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted for interim or annual dates after january   the company adopted asu  effective january   asu  has no material effect in the company’s financial statements   the company has reviewed all other fasb issued asu accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effective dates during the period reported and in future periods the company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous gaap and do not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the company’s reported financial position or operations in the near term          note  going concern   the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company has limited assets has incurred losses since inception of  and has negative cash flows from operations as of march   the company had a working capital deficit of  the company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing daytoday operations and its corporate overhead the company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations from debt or equity financing or from a combination of these sources these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   note  property and equipment   property and

bingham canyon corporation and its wholly owned operating subsidiary paradigm convergence technologies corporation          item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   executive overview   on august   bingham entered into a securities exchange agreement the “exchange agreement” with paradigm convergence technologies corporation a nevada corporation “paradigm” pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement paradigm became the whollyowned subsidiary of bingham after the exchange transaction bingham is a holding company which through paradigm is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures   we are a technology development and licensing company specializing in environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability we hold patent intellectual property andor distribution rights to innovative products and technologies our overall strategy is to market new products and technologies through the use of equipment leasing joint ventures licensing distributor agreements and partnerships generally it is not our intent to be the primary producer and distributor of the technology products but rather to license the underlying technology while developing new opportunities and applications for the products and promoting the brands we intend to also continue our constant pursuit of new technologies through acquisition or invention upon which we can build and expand our joint venture and licensing core business however paradigm may not be able to identify suitable license or joint venture opportunities nor guarantee that any such agreements will be profitable   bingham had not recorded revenues for the two fiscal years prior to its acquisition of paradigm and was dependent upon financing to continue basic operations paradigm has recorded revenue since it initiated operations in  however those revenues have not been sufficient to finance operations the company recorded a net loss of  for the three months ended march   and accumulated losses of  from inception through march     bingham remains dependent upon additional financing to continue operations the company intends to raise additional equity financing through private placements of its common stock we expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws the purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs as discussed below and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended we also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock   the expected costs for the next twelve months include   a major commercial launch of nontoxic sanitizing disinfecting and sterilizing products and technologies with a strong emphasis on health care facilities including hospitals nursing homes assisted living facilities clinics and medical dental and veterinarian offices continued research and development on product generation units including those designed for onsite deployment at customers’ facilities accelerated research and development on applications of the products in the agricultural sector most specifically with respect to abatement of a disease crisis caused by a certain bacterium in the us and elsewhere acquiring available complementary technology rights payment of shortterm debt hiring of additional personnel throughout  and general and administrative operating costs management projects these costs to total approximately  to minimize these costs the company intends to maintain its practice of controlling operating costs with efficient facilities commitments continuing below market salaries and consulting fees and rigorous prioritization of expenditures   based on its understanding of the commercial readiness of its products and technologies the capabilities of its personnel current and being hired established business relationships and the general market conditions management believes that the company expects to be at or close to profitability by the end of           liquidity and capital resources   a critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is the ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity andor debt financing we do not anticipate generating sufficient positive internal operating cash flow until such time as we can deliver our products to market and generate substantial revenues which may take the next full year to fully realize if ever in the event we cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan we may have to significantly curtail our operations this would materially impact our ability to continue operations     summary of balance sheet   period ended

total stockholders’ deficit             at march   the company recorded a net loss of  and a working capital deficit of  we have recorded a relatively small amount of revenues from operations since inception and we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs during  and  we have primarily relied upon advances and loans from a stockholder and third parties to fund our operations the company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing daytoday operations and its corporate overhead we had  in cash at march   compared to   in cash at december   we had total liabilities of  at march   compared to  at december     our current cash flow is not sufficient to meet our monthly expenses of approximately  and to fund future research and development we intend to rely on additional debt financing loans from existing stockholders and private placements of common stock for additional funding however there is no assurance that additional funding will be available we do not have material commitments for future capital expenditures however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain shortterm financing or that sources of such financing if any will continue to be available and if available that they will be on favorable terms   the decrease in total liabilities was primarily the result of conversion of notes payable and accrued interest to equity during december    during the next  months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of exchange act reports we believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management significant stockholders andor third parties we may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses          commitments and obligations   the company recorded notes payable totaling approximately  at march   compared to notes payable of  at december   these notes payable are the result of loans from five related parties and one unrelated third party related party notes payable were  and  at march   and december   respectively the notes payable are unsecured noncollateralized bear interest from  to  and are due for periods ranging from “on demand” to  months from their original issue dates the unrelated third part note was  at march   and december   the note bears interest rate of  per annum and a default interest rate of  per annum the note is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on a property located in fuquay varina north carolina owned by a minority stockholder and by

march   the “ first quarter” the revenue increase for the period was due to the increased volume of fluids sold   cost of sales increased to  for the  first quarter compared to  for the  first quarter the cost of sales increase during the  first quarter was due to the cost associated with the increased volume of fluids sold and depreciation   total operating expenses increased to  during the  first

spending          general and administrative expenses increased to  for the  first quarter compared to  during the  first quarter the increase in general and administrative expense increase during the first quarter of  was due to hiring new employees opening a new facility and recording stock option compensation expense for stock options issued during the quarter   research and development expenses decreased to  for the  first quarter compared to  during the  first quarter the decrease in research and development expense during the first quarter of  was primarily due to completion of field testing in one area of the company’s business   depreciation and amortization expenses increased to  during the  first quarter compared to  during the  first quarter the increase was primarily due to an increase in intangible assets and the amortization associated with the increase   total interest expenses increased to  during the  first quarter compared to  during the  first quarter total

considered material to investors   critical accounting policies   emerging growth company  we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the recently enacted jumpstart our business startups act of  the “jobs act” as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company among other things we will not be required to   • have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act   • submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency”   • obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and   • disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity pursuant to an effective registration statement iii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if

communicated to our president as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on that evaluation our president concluded that as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective     notwithstanding this finding of ineffective disclosure controls and procedures we concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this form k present fairly in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   changes in internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting our principal executive officer is

principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements for the period ended march   management has relied on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso “internal control  integrated framework” to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon that framework our president has determined that our internal control over financial reporting for period ended march   the year ended december   was not effective   the material weaknesses relate to the limited number of persons responsible for the recording and reporting of financial information the lack of separation of financial reporting duties and the limited size of our management team in general we are in the process of evaluating methods of improving our internal control over financial reporting including the possible addition of financial reporting staff and the increased separation of financial reporting responsibility and intend to implement such steps as are necessary and possible to correct these material weaknesses   our management determined that there were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the first quarter of  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   there has been no change in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   internal control systems no matter how well designed and operated have inherent limitations  therefore even a system which is determined to be
