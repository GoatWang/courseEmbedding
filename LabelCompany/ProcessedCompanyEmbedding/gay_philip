and british literary tables spawning its own constellation of important writers and winning a dedicated audience no one though until philip gambone has attempted to offer a collective portrait of our most important gay fiction writers this selection of interviews attempts just that and is notable both for the depth of gambone’s probing conversations and for the sheer range of important authors includedallen barnettchristopher brampeter cameronbernard cooperdennis coopermichael cunninghambrad goochjoseph hansenscott heimandrew holleranalan hollinghurstbrian keith jacksonrandall kenandavid leavittmichael lowenthalpaul monettemichael navadavid plantejohn prestonlev raphaeledmund white synopsis may belong to another edition of this title about the author philip gambone is an awardwinning essayist journalist and fiction writer living in boston he teaches writing at harvard university his previous work includes a book of stories the language we use up here he is the author of a novel beijing also published by the press robert giard contributed photos of sixteen of the writers interviewed from publishers weekly a welcome compilation of interviews gambone has conducted with  gay writers since  this collection amounts to a compelling portrait gallery of many influential figures gambones knowledge of each writers work and his sensitivity to the craft is impressive while consciously eschewing literary gossip his carefully probing interviews provide insight into the working methods and aesthetic personal and social concerns of a varied group including such wellknown writers as edmund white and andrew holleran as well as those who emerged in the late 0s and s including alan hollinghurst randall kenan and scott heim presented in roughly chronological order by date of interview the book amounts to a broad overview of the breathlessly rapid development of gay fiction and its themes from early comingout novels such as edmund whites a boys own story to more complex visions of a world in which gay people are no unhappier than other people many of the writers stress how important it is for them to feel the freedom to depict their world honestly there are also some provocative juxtapositions in which authors reflect on and in the notable case of dennis cooper vehemently reject the work of their contemporaries heres hoping that gambone is at work on volume two
