domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson  johnsons would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground ie uses

dennys challenger jack in the box tylenol union carbide discussion reference list team members analysis case study the johnson  johnson tylenol crisis before the crisis tylenol was the most successful overthecounter product in the united states with over one hundred million users tylenol was responsible for  percent of johnson  johnsons corporate profits during the first  quarters of  tylenol accounted for  percent of johnson  johnsons yeartoyear sales growth and  percent of the companys yeartoyear profit growth tylenol was the absolute leader in the painkiller field accounting for a  percent market share outselling the next four leading painkillers combined including anacin bayer bufferin and excedrin had tylenol been a corporate entity unto itself profits would have placed it in the top half of the fortune  berge  during the fall of  for reasons not known a malevolent person or persons presumably unknown replaced tylenol extrastrength capsules with cyanidelaced capsules resealed the packages and deposited them on the shelves of at least a halfdozen or so pharmacies and food stores in the chicago area the poison capsules were purchased and seven unsuspecting people died a horrible death johnson  johnson parent company of mcneil consumer products company which makes tylenol suddenly and with no warning had to explain to the world why its trusted product was suddenly killing people berge  primary evidence robert andrews assistant director for public relations at johnson  johnson recalls how the company reacted in the first days of the crisis we got a call from a chicago news reporter he told us that the medical examiner there had just given a press conferencepeople were dying from poisoned tylenol he wanted our comment as it was the first knowledge we had here in this department we told him we knew nothing about it in that first call we learned more from the reporter than he did from us andrews dilemma points out something that has become more prevalent with the expansion of  hour electronic media the media will often be the first on the scene thus have information about the crisis before the organization does berge  johnson  johnson chairman james burke reacted to the negative media coverage by forming a sevenmember strategy team the teams strategy guidance from burke was first how do we protect the people and second how do we save this product the companys first actions were to immediately alerted consumers across the nation via the media not to consume any type of tylenol product they told consumers not to resume using the product until the extent of the tampering could be determined johnson  johnson along with stopping the production and advertising of tylenol withdraw all tylenol capsules from the store shelves in chicago and the surrounding area after finding  more contaminated bottles tylenol realized the vulnerability of the product and ordered a national withdraw of every capsule broom  by withdrawing all tylenol even though there was little chance of discovering more cyanide laced tablets johnson  johnson showed that they were not willing to take a risk with the publics safety even if it cost the company millions of dollars the end result was the public viewing tylenol as the unfortunate victim of a malicious crime broom  johnson  johnson also used the media both pr and paid advertising to communicate their strategy during the crisis johnson  johnson used the media to issue a national alert to tell the public not to use the tylenol product in the first week of the crisis johnson  johnson established a  hot line for consumers to call the company used the  number to respond to inquires from customers concerning safety of tylenol they also establish a tollfree line for news organizations to call and receive pretaped daily messages with updated statements about the crisis berge  before the crisis johnson  johnson had not actively sought press coverage but as a company in crisis they recognized the benefits of open communications in clearly disseminating warnings to the public as well as the companys stand broom  several major press conferences were held at corporate headquarters within hours an internal video staff set up a live television feed via satellite to the new york metro area this allowed all press conferences to go national jim burke got more positive media exposure by going on  minutes and the donahue show and giving the public his command messages fink  johnson  johnson communicated their new triple safety seal packaging a glued box a plastic sear over the neck of the bottle and a foil seal over the mouth of the bottle with a press conference at the manufacturers headquarters tylenol became the first product in the industry to use the new tamper resistant packaging just  months after the crisis occurred berge  secondary evidence the initial media reports focused on the deaths of american citizens from a trusted consumer product in the beginning the product tampering was not known thus the media made a very negative association with the brand name all  networks lead with the tylenol story on the first day of the crisis cbs put a human face on the story which contained the following when  yearold mary kellerman of elk grove village ill awoke at dawn with cold symptoms her parents gave her one extrastrength tylenol and sent her back to bed little did they know they would wake up at  am to find their daughter dying on the bathroom floor kaplin pg   the print media weighed in with equally damaging headlines time magazine poison madness in the midwest newsweek the tylenol scare the washington post tylenol killer or cure the media was not only focused on the deaths but it was also pervasive throughout the crisis over  separate news stories ran in us newspapers and hundreds of hours of national and local television coverage a post crisis study by johnson  johnson said that over  percent of the american population had heard of the chicago deaths due to cyanidelaced tylenol within the first week of the crisis two news clipping services found over  news clippings on the tylenol story one of the services claimed that this story had been given the widest us news coverage since the assassination of president john f kennedy kaplin  media reporting would continue to focus on tylenol killing people until more information about what caused the deaths was made available in most crises media will focus on the sensational aspects of the crisis and then follow with the cause as they learn more about what happened scholarly journals scholars have come to recognize johnson  johnsons handling of the tylenol crisis as the example for success when confronted with a threat to an organizations existence berge lauds the case in the following manner the tylenol crisis is without a doubt the most exemplary case ever known in the history of crisis communications any business executive who has ever stumbled into a public relations ambush ought to appreciate the way johnson  johnson responded to the tylenol poisonings they have effectively demonstrated how major business has to handle a disaster pg   the tylenol case was the bases for many of the crisis communications strategies developed by researchers over the last  years bergs suffering strategy and benoits rectification strategies both were developed from doing case studies of how johnson  johnson handled the tylenol poisonings coombs  discussion the crises category in the johnson  johnson tylenol case is terrorism combs defines terrorism as intentional actions taken by external actors designed to harm the organization directly hurt employees or customers or indirectly reduce sales or disrupt production product tampering hostage taking sabotage and workplace violence are examples of terrorism the violent outside agent promotes attributions of external locus and uncontrollability the tylenol product tampering clearly fits the terrorism category an external agent presumably acted to hurt the customers and possibly the employees of johnson  johnson the other categories faux pas accidents or transgression do not fit in the tylenol case so there was no crosscategorization in this case crisis response strategies used by johnson  johnson johnson  johnson employed forgiveness and sympathy strategy for this crisis forgiveness strategy seeks to win forgiveness from the various publics and create acceptance for the crisis johnson  johnson used remediation and rectification both forgiveness strategies in the tylenol crisis remediation offers some form of compensation to help victims of the crisis johnson  johnson provided the victims families counseling and financial assistance even though they were not responsible for the product tampering negative feelings by the public against johnson  johnson were lessoned as the media showed them take positive actions to help the victims families berg  rectification involves taking action to prevent a recurrence of the crisis in the future johnson  johnsons development of triple sealed packaging is an example of rectification they also developed new random inspection procedures before the shipment of tylenol to retailers berg  sympathy strategy was a big component of johnson  johnsons crisis communication strategy sympathy strategy wins support from the public by portraying the organization as the unfair victim of an attack from an outside entity johnson  johnsons willingness to accept losses by pulling the tylenol product developed sympathy with the public berg  robb  the johnson  johnson tylenol crisis is an example of how an organization should communicate with the various publics during a crisis the organizations leadership set the example from the beginning by making public safety the organizations number one concern this is particularity important given the fact that johnson  johnsons main mission with tylenol is to enhance the publics wellbeing or heath although johnson  johnsons leadership performed superbly during the crisis there were some important areas tylenol improved upon after the crisis johnson  johnson did not have a proactive public affairs program before the crisis the only media relations engaged in by johnson  johnson was in the advertising and marketing area in the early stages of the crisis tylenol was informed about what was going on from a chicago reporter if this particular reporter had been more contentious or adversarial the whole crisis may have taken on a different form in the publics perception johnson  johnsons failure to employestablish a positive relationship with the media a key stakeholder forced the company to respond to the crisis in an advertisinglike manner johnson  johnson received criticism from the media for not being genuine due to the slick saleslike response ads run during the crisis the personal messages with the media from the ceo of the organization enabled johnson  johnson to overcome this problem today johnson  johnson has completely recovered its market share lost during the crisis the organization was able to reestablish the tylenol brand name as one to the must trusted overthecounter consumer products in american johnson  johnsons handing of the tylenol crisis is clearly the example other companies should follow if the

decades since a consumer products companys worst nightmare became tragic reality for johnson  johnson in the space of a few days starting sept   seven people died in the chicago area after taking cyanidelaced capsules of extrastrength tylenol the painkiller that was the drugmakers bestselling productmarketers predicted that the tylenol brand which accounted for  percent of the companys net income in  would never recover from the sabotage but only two months later tylenol was headed back to the market this time in tamperproof packaging and bolstered by an extensive media campaign a year later its share of the  billion analgesic market which had plunged to  percent from  percent following the poisoning had climbed back to  percentwhat set apart johnson  johnsons handling of the crisis from others it placed consumers first by recalling  million bottles of tylenol capsules from store shelves and offering replacement product in the safer tablet form free of chargebefore  nobody ever recalled anything said albert tortorella a managing director at bursonmarsteller inc the new york public relations firm that advised johnson  johnson companies often fiddle while rome burns advertisement continue reading the main story james burke the companys chairman was widely admired for his leadership in the decision to pull tylenol capsules off the market and for his forthrightness in dealing with the media in a news conference only a month and a half after the tragedy he gave a full chronology of what the company had done he looked in complete control said tortorella continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the moves were costly johnson  johnson spent more than  million for the  recall and relaunch of tylenol a much smaller recall in  and a second relaunch also ran into millions of dollarsbut johnson  johnsons shareholders were hurt only briefly in  the stock which had been trading near a week high just before the tragedy seesawed in panic selling but recovered to its highs only two months laterinvestors have had little to complain about since then if you had invested  in johnson  johnson shares on september   just before the first tylenol episode you would have  today after four stock splits the company has paid out increasing dividends for  yearsmichael holland manager of the holland balanced fund said johnson  johnsons
