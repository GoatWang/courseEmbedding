book this thoroughly researched study highlights the international communitys failure to regulate contemporary state research development marketing andor deployment of riot control agents and incapacitating chemical agent weapons show all about the authors dr michael crowley is project coordinator of bradford nonlethal weapons research project and research associate with the omega research foundation he has worked for over  years on arms control and human rights issues including with amnesty international the arias foundation basic and as executive director of vertic show all reviews “in chemical control michael crowley sets out a threestage holistic approach to arms control and illustrates it by applying it to the regulation of incapacitating chemical agents and riot control agents and their means of delivery … here is a strategy in which biologists can apply their expertise and as the book demonstrates it has a good chance of working” professor malcolm dando the biologist vol   february “his thoroughlyresearched book examines in detail ica weapons riot control agents rcas and their means of delivery …  crowley has not only provided a reference work for policymakers and academics alike but also a solid framework for structuring debates on the future of disarmament and arms control given that science and technology are evolving at a greater speed than the international community can regulate and that existing treaty regimes can be updated” noel stott african security review august “michael crowley’s chemical control is an impressive piece of scholarship and a valuable addition to the literature surrounding use of chemical weapons and riot control agents and their regulation under international law … this is an excellent book and … an authoritative reference in the regulation of rcas and incapacitating chemical agent weapons it deserves to be widely read and assimilated by lawyers diplomats medical professionals nongovernmental organisations as well as by weapons developers and manufacturers” stuart maslen international journal of human rights vol   march “the monograph offers highly technical and detailed information on the nature of riot control and incapacitating agents and their delivery systems the research and development behind them where they are being manufactured and how they are traded …  commend him for offering a solid framework for structuring that particular debate on the future of disarmament and arms control and identifying the fundamental assumptions underlying both concepts” jean pascal zanders the trench thetrenchorg march “michael crowley makes a compelling argument that ambiguities surrounding riotcontrol and incapacitating chemical agents as well as their means of delivery present a threat to both human and international security … the pragmatic and authoritative approach adopted within this work means that this book will undoubtedly become a reference work for policy shapers and academics for years to come” dr brett edwards contemporary security policy contemporarysecuritypolicyorg february “for anyone considering the evolution of the use of chemical substances in different circumstances along with current regulation michael crowley´s book is a must he tackles the complicated subject of incapacitating chemical agent ica weapons and riot control agents rcas … i recommend this book not just to people interested in the topic professionally but most importantly to politicians diplomats and law enforcement institutions it is also a must for students of international relations and political sciences … ” cbrne world cbrnecom february “crowley does a good job of structuring his research in a way that helps the reader make sense of the technical aspects of these weapons as well as the complex array of applicable international law … crowley’s book is both an invaluable reference and a useful source of new ideas for addressing two problems stemming from the decision by states to prohibit toxicity as a weapon of war while leaving open its use for law enforcement” neil davison international review of the red cross “this is a timely book part of a series looking at governance and regulation issues it provides an unusual case study in what is deemed ‘holistic arms control’ a threestage process that is systematically explained here … the power of this essential book is in the detail and the same painstaking work will be necessary in the months and years ahead to demonstrate how these sublethal chemical weapons are being increasingly used to contain inequality and injustice” steve wright medicine conflict and survival “crowley’s new book and analysis is to be highly recommended to all who are interested in building a world free of a whole class of weapons of mass destruction—chemical weapons—and to those seeking to prevent the reemergence of deadly chemicals with almost  pages of footnotes and sources chemical control is meticulously documented making it an excellent reference volume for those interested in arms control disarmament relevant multilateral treaties and agreements as well as national and international enforcement” paul f walker nonproliferation review vol   here is a beautiful and meticulously researched text that needs to be read by everyone working for a world finally free of chemical weapons it is constructed as a case study in holistic arms control which is a novel and rich approach that calls for a still wider readership professor julian perry robinson harvard sussex program on chemical and biological weapons ukmichael crowleys book is an important contribution to the debate about whether law enforcement use of riot control and incapacitating agents would undermine the prohibition of poison weapons he places a complicated arms control issue into a broader legal and institutional context and discusses strategies for dealing with these evolving technologies a much needed book dr ralf trapp international disarmament consultant and former senior official at the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw the netherlandsthe development of incapacitating chemical agent based weapons presents a serious threat to the chemical weapons convention this book explains the importance of transparency on these chemicals as well as on riot control agents and their means of delivery and suggests how both types of weapon could be brought under effective international control this is a pressing task for the opcw especially in light of recent and repeated use of chemical

crowley principal scientist computational biophysics michaelcrowleynrelgov   research interests dr michael f crowley is a principal scientist in the national renewable energy laboratorys nrels biosciences center having joined the laboratory in  to develop a simulation and theory team he leads the theory modeling and simulation efforts for biofuels research he is the principal investigator for the us department of energys does bioenergy technologies office beto project biochemical process modeling and simulation in which enzyme digestion metabolic modeling and reactor and process design are the main thrusts he is coprincipal investigator and leads the modeling thrust of cbio the energy frontier research center in which nrel is a partner with purdue and multiple other collaborative projects in biofuels and computational chemistry research he and his team maintain a level of productivity that produces on the order of  peerreviewed articles a year and as many presentations and they are regarded internationally as arguably the most productive and authoritative center for biofuel and biomass simulation and theory crowley is a developer of both charmm and amber molecular dynamics software for biological macromolecular simulation and has contributed significant advances to highly parallel highperformance scientific software for use on supercomputers until recently his team included anttipekka hynninen who is pushing the frontier of scientific simulation using the most uptodate computer hardware available in preparation for future computer architectures crowlelys group has designed and implemented new methods and algorithms specifically for biomass and biofuelrelated questions an author on more than  peerreviewed scientific articles crowley has given more than  presentations more than  of those being by invitation crowley received his bs in chemistry from fordham university and his ms and phd in physical chemistry from the university of montana with a short period of study at the university of alberta his postdoctoral fellowship was at brandeis university with dr irving epstein his doctoral and postdoctoral research was studying coupled chemical oscillators and coupled nonlinear differential equations and it was the only study to date of nonforced coupled chemical reactions showing synchronization locking and chaotic behaviors in his time as assistant professor at penn state university crowley moved to studies of semiconductor surfaces at west virginia university he applied the nonlinear dynamical theories to controlling chaos in chemical oscillators and flame fronts in addition at carnegie mellon university and the pittsburgh supercomputing center and at the scripps research institute with david case and charles brooks crowley developed highly parallel methods for simulations of biomacromolecules affiliated research programs enzyme–microbe development biomass deconstruction  pretreatment biological  catalytic conversion of

collaboration with professor charles l brooks iii at the university of michigan areas of expertise biomass degrading enzyme biophysics and design cellulases and other biomassactive enzymes are used in the industrial conversion of biomass to its components for further upgrading to fuels and products research on these enzymes is focused on determining the mechanism of action thermodynamics and barriers in the enzymatic digestion of plant cell walls using molecular mechanics and dynamics with advanced sampling methods crowley and his team determine free energies such as binding of substrates conformational changes reaction profiles and barriers with the aim of gaining basic understanding of how the enzymes work and how they can be engineered to work more efficiently for better fuel production the team has had successes with many cellulases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases uncovering the mechanisms of their cbms linkers active sites and binding sites and predicting mutational changes for better performance cellulose binding domain is thermodynamically more stable on the top hydrophobic face of cellulose product blue binding in a family  cellobiohydrolase is bound in the pocket by amino acids yellow which are present all the way until their product is expelled cellulose hemicellulose other plant cell wall materials cellulose is the most plentiful biopolymer on earth the research of crowley and his team discovers the intricacies of cellwall polymer structure and function and their interactions to form cell wall architecture the aim has traditionally been to understand the substrate of the enzymes studied in order to improve both the enzymes and the pretreatment methods with the longterm goal of possibly changing the cellulose that has been produced by plants the team is expanding research to study material properties strong publications in cellulose structure including force field analysis polymorph studies decrystallization thermodynamics and structural understanding such as how twist occurs in cellulose are being published the teams efforts are also directed toward understanding the production of cell wall materials through synthase transferase and assembly modeling and simulation cellulose fibril twist studied to determine source of twisting in hydrogen bonding patterns model of cellulose fibril formation from synthase rosettes in plants cellulose fibril twist studied to determine source of twisting in hydrogen bonding patterns cellulose fibril twist studied to determine source of twisting in hydrogen bonding patterns this modeling will help to understand the interactions that are important in cell walls and in breaking them down to component sugars to be upgraded to fuels cellulosomes in besc the computational modeling has centered on the mechanisms of recalcitrance and bacterial conversion of cell wall material one of the most fascinating and effective mechanisms found in bacteria is the cellulosome approach in which anywhere from a few to tens of enzymes and other cellwallactive components are assembled on scaffolds which may be tethered to the bacterium bind and act on plant cell walls to depolymerize cellulose hemicellulose and lignin to oligomers that can be upgraded within the bacterial cell coarsegrain model of complex cellulosome with  primary scaffolds on a secondary

thioesterase is a key enzyme in producing fatty acids from sugars in the pathway from sugars to diesel and aviation fuels by microbes molecular dynamics and simulation code development charmm and amber code development is an integral part of crowleys work he has been a developer of amber and charmm since  and has contributed to the highperformance aspects of both and he has led efforts to modernize them the development of the fast domdec code in charmm was led by crowley through the heroic efforts of anttipekka hynninen at nrel and has brought charmm to the level of performance of other highperforming codes carrying with it the vast and unparalleled scientific functionality and the introduction of parallel gpu implementations this work continues with new methods of sampling
