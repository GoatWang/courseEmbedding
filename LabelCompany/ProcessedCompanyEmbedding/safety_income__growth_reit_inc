growth  safety income and growth inc pendingsafe  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»replace tips with safety income and growthjul  about safety income safe dane bowler value hedge fund analyst reits longshort equitynd market capitalsummarysafe is a new reit with longterm potentialits cashflows are eponymously safe relative to most equitiesground leases provide stable income for decadesa new reit safety income and growth inc pendingsafe provides a superiorrisk adjusted return than tips with about as much income surety as something that is not government insured can have safe gives investors more than double the return of the ishares tips bond etf nysearcatip further it provides a similar inflation hedge in that its revenues have cpi adjustments investors with a reasonable risk tolerance should look into safe as a higher return alternative to tip we will begin by introducing this brand new reit and follow with a demonstration of its advantages over tip additionally once it starts paying a yield which management is targeting at  it will provide a larger current return the company safety income and growth inc is a new yorkbased reit specializing in longterm land leases through ownership of land in prominent areas it collects a steady stream of income by leasing its land to the businesses and properties that sit on top of it safe ipoed on  at  per share source snl financial in addition to its common stock the company has an equal number of op units and a  million credit facility source snl financial this capital structure leaves safe with an implied market cap of just over  million source snl financial it is still rather small but bigger than most reits that are just starting out at  million it is large enough to be included in the rmz which gets it in the hands of institutions and etfs with a total of  properties the reit has spent most of the money it raised in the ipo source snl financial while reits have had land lease assets before this is the first one where such assets are the focus naturally investors will have some questions including the following what returns can be expected what are the terms of the leases how big is the total addressable market we will answer these questions with a look at safes properties and leases as of the ipo all of which are shown below source safe prospectus the property types as of the ipo were mostly hotel with some office  mob  multifamily and  selfstorage the most important column in the chart above is the ground rent coverage which indicates the tenants ability and willingness to pay ground leases sit at the opco level which puts them at the top of the food chain pari passu with utility bills if the tenant wants to operate their business they must pay safe in the event the tenant fails to pay the reit can take control of the land and the building on top of it thus there is actually upside for safe in default as it would get to claim ownership of the building which is often more valuable than the land in most cases the land is only  of the value with the collateral being worth significantly more given high rent coverage and the recourse in default it is quite likely tenants will pay safes properties can be thought of as a proxy for growing perpetuities the rents start out small but get big over time through cpibased escalators source safe prospectus total cash rent from its ipo portfolio is  million note the contrast with gaap rent of  million the difference here represents straightlining since gaap reports the average rent over the life of the leases given the escalators and the lease terms as long as  years it is quite a bit larger importantly these are net leases with the tenant responsible for taxes and maintenance of property as such rent is roughly equivalent to noi these properties were acquired from istar at a  initial cash cap rate indicating a value of  million any time properties are contributed in an ipo by the manager istar is the external manager of safe we are skeptical such a contribution is an easy way for managers to give themselves a big payday and potentially even get far more than the properties are worth thus we must analyze if a  cap rate on these properties is a fair deal for shareholders most ground leases on highquality properties tend to go for  so it is on the upper end of the range indicating a fair deal but there are some property location concerns i am a bit skeptical of the residual value of land in detroit and milwaukee lets take a closer look the milwaukee location is just off of highway  and within the main part of the city source safe prospectus this seems like a decent location but it is definitely not a top msa the building itself has class a apartments and looks quite nice meaning the collateral is substantial source safe prospectus we are further comforted by strong rent coverage of x and a year remaining lease term source safe prospectus the detroit property is land that is groundleased to an office tower shown below source safe prospectus once again i consider this ample collateral to protect from default and the lease coverage is strong at x overall i am inclined to believe that a  cap rate was fair for the initial portfolio pipeline the total addressable market for ground leases is quite large and somewhat untapped due to the lack of public funding for this sort of investment aside from safe ground lease assets are mostly owned by wealthy individuals and some pe through istar safe has access to a considerably larger network than a  million reit would typically have this gives the reit a pipeline well in excess of its available capital already in its short tenure as a public reit safe has made a sizable acquisition a  million ground lease under an apartment complex on hollywood boulevard the lease terms are shown below source safe prospectus it is on a corner location with the first floor retail and the rest apartments short of california going underwater from some geological forces this land will always be of value it is a true trophy asset but it comes with a trophy cap rate of just  valuation and expected returns if one agrees with my analysis that the initial properties were acquired at fair market value safe is basically trading at its asset value the ipo proceeds are still in cash with the exception of the hollywood boulevard acquisition which in my opinion was also at fair value thus we think safe is at an acceptable price but not discounted that being said it still has an attractive risk adjusted return profile once the ipo capital is spent the reit should have a real return of  annually we call it a real return because a majority of the leases are cpiadjusted which provides an excellent inflation hedge at nd market capital we target a significantly larger return so this one is not for us at the current market price but there are plenty of investors for whom safe makes a good investment its risk profile is about as low as an equity securitys risk can be cash flow interruptions are likely to be rare or nonexistent and even if they happen there is a healthy excess of collateral to make up for it the long lease terms provide superior visibility into future cash flows and the low leverage minimizes volatility we began this article with a suggestion that safe is a better version of tip and we will elaborate on this conclusion below similar inflation hedge just as treasury inflationprotected securities are intended to deliver a real return safes escalators convert its perpetuitylike cash flow stream into a real return similar cash flow security there is clearly going to be market price volatility due to the trading nature of equities and there is slightly more longterm risk as the cash flows are not guaranteed by the us government but we view safe as having a low level of risk for those with a long investment horizon that can tolerate a little bit of risk safe is about as close as an equity can get to a government bond level of risk roughly double the returns tip has a yield of  which is less than half our estimated real return on safe of about  potential concerns safe does not currently pay a dividend so those who need immediate income may not like this as an alternative to bonds however it is a reit and will legally have to pay a dividend soon to maintain reit status in the prospectus management indicated a  annual dividend which is a yield of about  but over time i expect this to grow to closer to  another concern could be the external management many investors particularly those in the reit world are leery of external management due to conflicts of interest which can cause managers to seek growth even when it is not accretive the bottom line those with some degree of risk tolerance who own tip or other inflationprotected bonds should give some consideration to owning safe instead it provides the same inflation hedge but with materially larger returns disclosure this

ipo between  and  per sharethe company will trade on the nyse under the ticker symbol “safe”its net lease structure high quality portfolio and experience management team make up optimistic on the deal we recommend reit investors consider investingipo article safety income and growth on april   safety income and growth pendingsafe filed for an sa ipo with the sec seeking to raise  million the company plans to offer  million shares with  million shares as an overallotment option for underwriters at a price range of between  to  istar inc plans to purchase  million worth of shares at the ipo price at the time of the offering representing a  stake in the company assuming safe prices at the midpoint of its proposed price range it would commend a fully diluted market cap value of m the company is expected to ipo on thursday  underwriters for the ipo include barclays jp morgan bank of america merrill lynch raymond james and associates mizuho securities usa and citigroup the company plans to use approximately  million of its total proceeds from the offering to purchase the acquisition gnls safety income and growth is one of three reits expected to ipo this week company overview new yorkbased safety income and growth was founded in  with the objective of acquiring owning managing financing and capitalizing on ground net leases gnls gnls involves leasing land typically for a long period of time ranging from  to  years to a tenant for the purpose of building real estate on the property and are most often triple net leases which means the tenant is responsible for costs including development costs capital expenditures and all property operating expenses the objective in creating the gnl provide a safe secure and growing cash flow stream in the form of rental income gnl lists the following criteria for properties i the initial value of the gnl represents  to  of the combined property value ii the ground rent coverage of the gnl is between x to x and iii the gnl contains contractual rent escalation clauses or percentage rent that participates in gross revenues generated by the commercial real estate on the land currently its portfolio consists of  properties located in major metropolitan areas that were identified by istar it intends to acquire two additional gnls shortly after the closing of the offering after the ipo safe will be externally managed by sfty manager llc a whollyowned subsidiary of istar istar has been an real estate investor for over  years based in new york new york it has  billion in total assets seven regional offices across the us although safe believes its the first publiclytraded company formed to acquire and manage gnls it faces tough competition both for tenants as well as investment opportunities from other investors financial institutions real estate companies and numerous commercial developers for both tenants and investment opportunities we first covered this deal on our ipo insights platform executive management jay sugarman has served as the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of istar inc since  previously he founded and acted as cogeneral partner of starwood mezzanine investors lp a private investment partnership that specializes in structured real estate finance mr sugarman graduated summa cum laude from princeton university and completed his master of business administration degree at harvard business school nina b matis serves as chief investment officer since october  as well as istars executive vice president chief legal officer and chief investment officer positions she has held since  ms matis previously served as a partner in the law firm of katten muchin rosenman llp one of istars principal outside law firms she received a ba degree with honors from smith college and a jd degree from new york university school of law financial details safe has strong revenue growth revenue generated was m and m in  and  respectively representing yoy growth of  interest expense has remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue interest expense was equal to  of revenue in  other expenses included real estate expense depreciation and amortization and general administration the company has generated profits each year of m and m in  and  respectively as of its ipo safe has total assets of m and total debt obligations of m sa conclusion consider a modest investment safes revenue growth experienced management team and relationship with istar boosts our optimism it this deal we also like that ground net leases offer greater certainty that tenants will make rent payments due to the fact that if a tenant default the gnl lessor typically has the right to regain possession of the land as well as take ownership of the building this provides a strong incentive for tenants to make payments although rising interest rates and stiff competition in the real estate space add risk we are bullish on the deal and recommend investors looking for increased exposure to the space consider a small investment we hear the book continues to build don dions ipo insights provides uptodate information and analysis on the major ipos each week along with

built into the lease the value of the lease is worth  of the combined value of the landbuildings so often times in a foreclosure scenario a ground net lessor can make more than a full recovery at first i thought this was a public listing of the net lease jv istar has setup with a sovereign wealth fund gic however it appears to be a separate portfolio but with investors in that fund participating in the sfty ipo  safety income  growth inc will start out life with  assets from istars net lease portfolio all  are either ground leases or at least lookfunction similarly if you squint  the two primary assets will be one ally center which is the largest office building in michigan leased out to ally financial and pwc and a portfolio of  hilton branded hotels leased to the recent spinoff park hotels  resorts a good strategy in recent years has been buying net lease reits that are discounted because of concentrated tenant exposure gpt fcpt csal  before they make deals to diversify their rent roll  istar says theyre looking at a pipeline of over mm ground net lease deals so expect them to diversify fairly quickly after listing  theyre starting with mm in debt at a rate of  after the deal is done theyll enter into a new mm credit facility giving them additional room to add ground leases istar will be the external manager of sfty itll have one of the more unique external management agreements ive seen  waiving their fee altogether for the first year  no incentive fee or termination fee  base management fee of  on equity up to b and  above  the management fee will be paid in stock  granted theres little work in managing a lease that expires in  doesnt even look like a valid year but its another reason this entity should be an easy to sell to the masses safety income  growth is paying about a  cap rate for istars assets combination of cash and stock the company argues that ground net leases should trade even lower than that this seems somewhat reasonable given the overcollateralization built into the structure if it trades anywhere near a  cap rate istar should be able to source a lot of deals that make sense especially early on when they can do small individual deals that still move the needle were still waiting on an ipo date but again i think this has potential to do well and gather a decent amount of assets what does this all mean for istar at year end they had a b net lease portfolio includes accumulated depreciation added back that generated an noi yield of  in my initial post last summer i argued the net lease portfolio should be valued at  cap rate which adds about mm marktomarket above the carrying value on istars balance sheet  its probably incorrect to assign a  cap rate to the entire portfolio but that would produce a b marktomarket gain quite significant for a company with a market cap of b  but now istar monetizes some assets at an attractive valuation by putting them in a simpler vehicle the market will be able to digest and assign a higher multiple to  all while earning a small carry on their remaining investment going forward  its hard to argue istar is anything but very cheap hopefully they use some of the proceeds to buyback stock thanks to the commenter in the original istar post for bringing this deal to my attention disclosure i own shares of star posted by mdc at  pm email

we referring to our reit istar or to the external manager of that entity in other words does this management fee accrue to us or to jay sugarmanreplydeleterepliesmdcapril   at  amistar is an internally managed reit the new entity will be managed by istar so the management fee accrues to istar the company not jay sugarman personallydeletereplyanonymousapril   at  amyou waste no time i have been following istar as i consider sugarman a master of sorts with out he managed capital allocation through the crisis i still struggle to see a favorable risk  reward on the star business given liquidityleverage levels but this newco is interesting it is a way to sort of revalue a portion of the book to a higher multiple while receiving cash flows to delever but struggling to quantify benefit at star any thoughts see analysis here httpstwittercomivebeenhadstatusreplydeleterepliesmdcapril   at  amyou view star as a forced seller seems harsh or a mischaracterization of their situation in my mind i do like that theyre a seller generally seems like the right time in the cycle and would help unveil the value but given they have access to the capital markets just recently refinanced their term facility like everyone else  i think they can be more opportunisticdeletereplyanonymousapril   at  ammaybe forced seller is too harsh a word but liquidity this year is tight while timing of cash flows from development book is lumpy interest expense alone consumes up nearly their entire cash income from the stable assets including pref payments cash ga adds another  million plus guided capex of m i realize prefs can be deferred but still looks harsh the gap needs to come from land production remaining condos and asset monetizations from its existing stable book eg net leases replydeleteanonymousapril   at  amagree maturities this year are a concern and will require some monetizations but should be manageable this should help a

soondeletereplyanonymousapril   at  pmany idea with all the recent transations settlements and spin off whats the leftover nols carrying over and do istar shareholders get any new shares for the gnlreplydeleterepliesmdcapril   at  pmthe latest nol number in the k was mm shareholders wont get shares directly its not a true spinoff istar has created a new entity and is selling some of their assets into sfty as part of the transaction istar is receiving some stock in sfty so shareholders will indirectly benefit that way if its well received by the market theres a part of me that is interested in sfty if it trades cheaply initially might take a little time for the market to warm up to the ideadeletereplyanonymousapril   at  pmhey mdc i love the writeups very interesting stuff any new thoughts on dfin thanksreplydeleterepliesmdcapril   at  amim still holding dfin its pretty clear they were completely unprepared for the spinoff and operating separately management has been all over the place on expense guidance and that form  bothers me a bit misleading how much of their revenue was really recurring in nature but the ipo market seems to be picking back up so maybe they have a bounce back year on the transactional side of the business its cheap and all of the near term cash flow is earmarked at debt reduction which i view as a positive thanks for readingdeletereplyanonymousapril   at  pmisnt istars leverage low x many reits out there are way more leveraged and they are profitable no a bit confused from comments if it wasnt for their nols they would be paying dividends now they only issue now is the remaining land porfolio which has improved a lotreplydeleterepliesmdcapril   at  pmthe x headline number includes the preferred stock as equity if you buy the common shares its more effectively debt so the leverage is a lot higher i think the others are bringing up the near term maturities more than the absolute level of leveragedeletereplyadlapril   at  amso happy to have stumbled onto this blog star is one of my largest longterm holdings along with bbxt rdnt fincantieri have you ever taken a look at brt pretty plain vanilla middling reit at this point with nols likely to be exhausted in the next  years or so and a dividend reinstated unless they find some creative way to avoid or blow up gould investors their
