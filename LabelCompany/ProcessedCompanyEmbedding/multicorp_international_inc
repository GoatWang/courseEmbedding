december   the company entered into a stock exchange agreement the “stock exchange agreement” with aquasil inc a new york corporation “aquasil” and the sole stockholder of aquasil in accordance with the stock exchange agreement the company acquired  of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of aquasil in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate  shares of the company’s common

prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern the company is a development stage company and is dependent on raising capital to commence principal operations these circumstances raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern  management believes the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise capital at present the company has no commitments for any additional financing management is currently seeking financing through a possible offering of common stock which will be used to finance operations until such financing is obtained it is the intent of stockholders to provide funds for professional fees related to maintaining the company’s public reporting status the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   f   multicorp international inc a development stage company notes to the financial statements unaudited note  — summary of significant accounting policies the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment actual results may vary from these estimates the financial statements have in management’s opinion been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation there was no material effect to the consolidated financial statements as a result of these reclassifications cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of commercial accounts and interestbearing bank deposits and are carried at cost which approximates current value items are considered to be cash equivalents if the original maturity is three months or less equipment and facilities equipment and facilities are recorded at cost depreciation is recorded using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from one to twentyfive years intangible assets acquired intangible assets are recognized at cost and are classified as assets with finite useful lives the company amortizes the intangible assets with five years using the straightline method over the estimated economic lives of the assets intangible assets are evaluated for impairment to determine if current circumstances and market conditions indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable the company recognized an impairment loss of  on the intangible assets during the year ended december   asset retirement obligations the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the well is spud or the asset is acquired and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount a gain or loss is recognized full cost method the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to the exploration and development of oil and gas properties are initially capitalized into a single cost center by country full cost pool at march   the company had one cost center  in the  united states all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves are amortized on the unitofproduction method using estimates of proved reserves once proved reserves are determined to exist at march   there was no amortization of these costs due to there being no production   f   multicorp international inc a development stage company notes to the financial statements unaudited note  — summary of significant accounting policies continued full cost method continued unproved property costs are excluded from the amortization base until determination of the existence of proved reserves on the respective property or until the requirement for impairment unproved properties are reviewed at the end of each quarter to determine whether portions of the costs should be reclassified to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization sales of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves capitalized costs are summarized as follows for the periods ended march   and december   respectively       march       december     shares issued to acquire the oil and gas properties             asset retirement cost             accumulated impairment             net               capitalized costs of oil and gas properties net of related deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value discounted at  per annum of the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling impairment is recognized the present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying the arithmetic average first day price of oil and natural gas for the preceding twelve months to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the end of the period less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions such present value of proved reserves future net cash flows excludes future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations should this comparison indicate an excess carrying value the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment expense we recognized  and  of impairment costs during the periods ended march   and december   respectively impairment fasb asc  requires that assets to be held and used be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable oil and gas properties accounted for using the full cost method of accounting which the company uses are excluded from this requirement but continue to be subject to the full cost methods impairment rules revenue recognition the company recognizes oil and natural gas revenues from our interests in producing wells when production is delivered to and title has transferred to the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonably determinable and collectability is reasonably assured gasbalancing arrangements are accounted for using the sales method fair value of financial instruments the company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  clarifies the definition of fair value prescribes methods for measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level  inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or

assets and liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data level  inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information

accounting policies continued use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates these estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments become necessary they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known the estimates on depreciation were based on the estimated useful lives of the companys assets any estimates during the period have had an immaterial effect on earnings earnings or loss per share the company accounts for earnings per share pursuant asc  earnings per share  which require disclosure on the financial statements of “basic” and “diluted” earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding

income  but only if the item reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period and    crossreference to other disclosures currently required under us gaap for other reclassification items that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period this would be the

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements on form k for december   together with notes thereto    please note that throughout this quarterly report and unless otherwise noted the words we our us the company or multicorp international refers to multicorp international inc summary the company with its recent acquisition of certain oil and gas assets located in new mexico has determined to pursue operations in the oil and gas business     however the company still holds the marketing and licensing of its proprietary software evicat which it acquired in february  but has no plans at this time to further that segment of its business liquidity  capital resources we are development stage company engaged in the acquisition exploration and development of oil and gas projects as at march   we have not generated any revenues we had no cash on hand at either march   or december     our total assets as at march   and december   were   our assets as at march   consist of the valuation of our oil and gas working interest in the cave pool unit and the equipment on site   we acquired these assets in late december  there were no significant changes to our current total liabilities for the three months ended march    which were  a slight decrease over december   current total liabilities of    the slight decrease was due to a decrease in short term notes payable from  at december   to  at march   as we settled debt by the issuance of shares the decrease was offset by a slight increase in accounts payable from  at december   to  at march   advances from stockholders remained constant for both periods at       our total liabilities were  at march   as compared to  as at december   brought about by an increase in our asset retirement obligation to  from  at december   we will require  over the next twelve month period to further our business plan of which approximately  will be allocated to the drilling of  wells on our oil and gas leases with the remaining  allocated for expenses related to the payment requirements related to our oil and gas assets our public reporting requirements and working capital we do not have the funding required to meet our ongoing obligations or to fund our planned development our ability to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is dependent upon our ability to raise funding  which we expect will be raised by the  continued issuance of equity to new stockholders the ability to borrow funds and ultimately upon our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations there can be no assurance that financing will be available to us when needed or if available that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholder obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments results of operations we have changed our business plan with the acquisition of oil and gas assets in december  by the company   we do not have any revenues and have not had any revenue since inception on september       we have operating losses of  for the three months ended march   as compared to operating losses of  for the three months ended march   the substantial decrease in operating losses is mainly  due to the fact that  we had paid  in stockbased compensation expenses in the three months ended march   with no comparable expense for the comparable period ended march   as well as  a decrease to other general and administrative expenses from  which includes the  in stock based compensation march   to  march    these reductions were offset by an increase in professional fees from   to  in the current three month period ended march   as well as  recorded as accretion of the discount asset retirement obligations in the current period with no similar expense in the prior comparative period in    in the three months ended december   we reported amortization of intangible assets with no comparable expense in the three months ended december   we have a net loss of  for the three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of  for the same period ended march       the significant increase in net losses is mainly related to a loss on debt extinguishment of  during the three month period ended march   as we settled certain debts with the issuance of shares of the company with no comparable amount for the period ended march     interest expense increased as well to  for the period ended march   from  march   basic and diluted net loss per share was  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders      item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is a smaller reporting company and is not required to provide this information   item   controls and procedures we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules ae and de as of march    this evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our sole officer  jean mann who is also the sole director   based on her evaluation she has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the evaluation date as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting   disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in multicorp’s reports filed or submitted under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   as of march   jean mann assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and sec guidance on conducting such assessments material weaknesses   jean mann has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the following material weaknesses            certain entity level controls establishing a “tone at the top” were considered material weaknesses as of march   we did not have an audit committee as the company has one officer who is also the sole director   no independent expert has been appointed to the audit committee so that it is not controlled by one individual as it is presently there is no policy on fraud a whistleblower policy cannot be established given the small size of the organization            jean mann’s override of existing controls is possible given the small size of the organization and lack of personnel              there is no system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting the company maintains an insufficient complement of personnel and outsources its accounting functions therefore it does not have controls in place to carry out ongoing monitoring responsibilities and ensure effective internal control over financial reporting   notwithstanding the assessment that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective jean mann believes that the company’s financial statements contained in its quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march   fairly present its financial condition results of operations and cash flows in all material respects   there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended march   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting      limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and our sole officer and director concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the internal control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   part ii – other
