headquartered in richmond virginia as of  mccollough took over the leadership of the company in june —succeeding richard l sharp who remained chairman of the company—after  years of extensive experience in merchandising and store management two of the retailers primary operating areas secondleading us electronics retailer the primary business unit of circuit city stores was the circuit city group which was the secondlargest us electronics retailer as of  behind best buy company which had fewer stores in fewer markets but higher sales circuit city owned stores in over six hundred us locations with most designated as superstores—that is as very large stores w alan mccollough chris kellygetty images  with broad selection and competitive prices selling a wide variety of products including consumer electronics such as audio and video equipment personal computers movies music games and entertainment software the circuit city web site provided shoppers with extensive product information direct shipment of purchases realtime inventory status of products in stores and express pickup enabling customers to order goods online and obtain them at specified stores the company previously ran over  shoppingmallbased circuit city express outlets the company also established the usedcar seller carmax in  at the time of mccolloughs ascendancy to the helm of circuit city carmax was the nations leading specialty retailer of used cars and a rapidly growing newcar retailer by  there were  carmax locations across the united states circuit of leadership mccollough began his professional career with the textile manufacturer milliken and company over his  years at milliken mccollough held various positions including cost accountant director of quality manufacturing plant manager and director of marketing mccollough joined circuit city in  as general manager of corporate operations within two years he was named assistant vice president directing the development of a large number of store operating procedures designed to promote quality and uniform service across the companys large and rapidly expanding store base along with these responsibilities mccollough led the implementation of the companys distributed pointofsales system which was used throughout the organization from  to  mccollough was vice president of circuit city and president of the companys central operating division which comprised more than onethird of the companys stores in  he became senior vice president in charge of merchandising a post that involved responsibilities for all merchandise selection purchasing and inventory management during the next three years mccollough developed sturdy working relationships with the vendor community that extended over the entertainmentsoftware consumerelectronics majorappliance and personalcomputer industries mccollough became president and chief operating officer in  which made him responsible for activities involving human relations and resources management information systems merchandising store operations and planning mccollough became chief executive officer of circuit city in june  a few months before this time the outgoing ceo sharp said of mccollough alans extensive experience in the critical areas of our business his commitment to our highquality consumer offers and his outstanding leadership talents make him the ideal person to guide our company into the next decade january   as ceo mccollough directed the continuing growth and development of both the circuit city and carmax automobile superstore businesses in june  mccollough was elected chairman of the board of directors lagging behind best buy in  upon becoming circuit citys chief executive officer mccollough found the company lagging behind best buy in such financial data as sales sales per square foot and return on investment although both stores saw slower sales in the first half of  best buy doubled its stock value in the same period that circuit city saw its value remain flat mccollough began implementing a detailed plan involving a new store format tests of a standalone applianceonly concept in which a small store would sell only appliances the rolling out of new merchandising displays and continuation of the expanding digitalproduct cycle in consumer electronics circuit city would stock more products on store shelves and place registers near entrances allowing consumers to more easily help themselves to products and to navigate the store in a more efficient manner—what mccollough called a grabandgo climate a combination of commissioned sales counselors and hourly employees were put in rotation at each store this new employment policy contrasted the historically exclusive use of commissioned personnel the switch helped reduce operating expenses mccollough also expanded the number of hightechnology products offered by circuit city outlets including digital cameras millimeter cameras software titles and video games new merchandising displays were created in order to better highlight the products and services available through the various alliances the company maintained with companies such as aol and sony by shifting circuit citys product lines and introducing highermargin newtechnology products mccollough hoped to rely less on sales from computers and other homeoffice products whose profit margins continued to erode eliminating appliances mccollough initiated a plan to eliminate major appliances from the main circuit city locations in order to provide more space on the selling floor and in the warehouse for the expanded product categories while the companys gross margins for appliances were in line with other products the storage and delivery costs of the oversized items were much greater than for smaller products mccollough also added that the appliance category did not have the same growth potential as consumer electronics as the selling of appliances was a cyclical business tied to housing starts and other economic factors mccollough remarked that  percent of customers bought appliances as replacements for older models in the end mccollough found that the company needed an extra  square feet of additional floor space per store in order to accommodate all of the highgrowth products it wanted to sell with lowes home depot sears and other companies all involved in the appliance market mccollough decided it would not be in the companys best interest to pursue further appliance sales in  mccollough opened  new stores and remodeled  to  existing stores each with a new open warehousestyle format—hardwood floors and bright signs replaced the former red black and chrome design scheme and wider aisles higher ceilings and great sight lines were introduced mccollough wanted the bold new atmosphere of circuit city to impress customers from the moment they walked into stores test markets for the consumer electroniconly format included richmond virginia and miami west palm beach tampa fort meyers and orlando florida along with these actions mccollough tested an applianceonly format in six standalone locations in florida mccollough also led circuit city to implement an internetbased training program for storelevel associates yearend results by the beginning of the last quarter of  circuit city continued to lag behind best buy despite mccolloughs initiatives however mccollough continued to believe that the new product cycle format changes and merchandising improvements would help circuit city better compete with best buy by the end of  mccollough saw improvement in sales at existing stores that had undergone remodeling to replace the defunct appliance business mccollough slowed the pace of totalstore overhauls hoping to strengthen the companys brand identity and returns on investment with a less expensive future remodel that of  million per store rather than  million seeing improvement in  mccollough began a new marketing program designed to better communicate circuit citys new look and product offerings to consumers he hired fiona dias as senior vice president of marketing in order to run marketing as a separate division rather than as part of another division as had been done in the past in the first part of  sales lost through the removal of appliances were balanced by overall sales increases resulting from overhauled store layouts and operations later in the year mccollough announced the companys new advertising slogan circuit city—were with you mccollough sought to improve customer service through an overhaul of internal operations—using six sigma an accepted business philosophy fostering customer satisfaction as its guideline still undecided with store formats in  mccollough spun off carmax in the first quarter of  after carmaxs business matured as customers bought used cars rather than new ones during the economic downturn of the early s mccollough hoped that separating the two businesses circuit city and carmax would permit the management of each to better focus on financial and operational objectives with respect to circuit city after a year and a half of testing several formats and programs the company had yet to determine a clearcut remodeling plan for its aging store base mccollough announced that circuit city would redesign three hundred of its stores to house new video departments complete with seating areas for the full hometheater experience to better merchandise the highgrowth television category the company had already been doing this in all newly built stores mccollough later announced that two other formats would also be tested one in chicago illinois and another in the baltimore–washington dc area this announcement caused some disruption on wall street as circuit city had difficulty communicating with the analyst community such issues continued to have adverse affects on the companys stock price and analyst reports  and beyond at the beginning of  mccollough continued to focus on updating circuit citys store base streamlining operations and polishing its consumer image after two full years in a state of transition the chain store seemed unable to move forward mccollough contended that the company had made much progress over those two years although he admitted that the company still had a long way to go before accomplishing its goals after successfully spinning off carmax mccollough abandoned the smaller mallbased circuit city express stores and the standalone appliance concept which had never truly materialized mccolloughs largest focus was on remodeling and redecorating circuit citys existing stores he expanded the homeoffice category complete with personal computers software and accessories and the entertainment software section to help boost foot traffic and bring in younger consumers however wall street analysts were still unsure about the future of circuit city as they waited for the company to finish remodeling its store base and to announce a growth plan analysts felt both projects were long overdue especially considering the opposition of best buy which was far ahead in terms of the executing of a growth plan brand positioning and building of vendor relationships while circuit city had advanced several positive store prototypes other stores remained outdated and poorly suited to the evolving consumerelectronics market over the nine months ending november   circuit city revenues fell  percent to  billion paralleling the weak retailsales environment caused by the general economic slowdown net losses from continuing operations rose  percent to  million reflecting declining grossprofit margins and increased remodeling and relocation expenses mccollough planned to move circuit city to the next phase of its remodeling program in two hundred stores in  however the company had been on the remodeling path for some time and had yet to see improvements in returns see also entry on circuit

circuit city stores  mayland drive richmond virginia  httpwwwcircuitcitycom ■ the electronics retail executive w alan mccollough was chairman president and chief executive officer of the national technologyservices and retail company circuit city stores headquartered in richmond virginia as of  mccollough took over the leadership of the company in june —succeeding richard l sharp who remained chairman of the company—after  years of extensive experience in merchandising and store management two of the retailers primary operating areas secondleading us electronics retailer the primary business unit of circuit city stores was the circuit city group which was the secondlargest us electronics retailer as of  behind best buy company which had fewer stores in fewer markets but higher sales circuit city owned stores in over six hundred us locations with most designated as superstores—that is as very large stores with broad selection and competitive prices selling a wide variety of products including consumer electronics such as audio and video equipment personal computers movies music games and entertainment software the circuit city web site provided shoppers with extensive product information direct shipment of purchases realtime inventory status of products in stores and express pickup enabling customers to order goods online and obtain them at specified stores the company previously ran over  shoppingmallbased circuit city express outlets the company also established the usedcar seller carmax in  at the time of mccolloughs ascendancy to the helm of circuit city carmax was the nations leading specialty retailer of used cars and a rapidly growing newcar retailer by  there were  carmax locations across the united states circuit of leadership mccollough began his professional career with the textile manufacturer milliken and company over his  years at milliken mccollough held various positions including cost accountant director of quality manufacturing plant manager and director of marketing mccollough joined circuit city in  as general manager of corporate operations within two years he was named assistant vice president directing the development of a large number of store operating procedures designed to promote quality and uniform service across the companys large and rapidly expanding store base along with these responsibilities mccollough led the implementation of the companys distributed pointofsales system which was used throughout the organization from  to  mccollough was vice president of circuit city and president of the companys central operating division which comprised more than onethird of the companys stores in  he became senior vice president in charge of merchandising a post that involved responsibilities for all merchandise selection purchasing and inventory management during the next three years mccollough developed sturdy working relationships with the vendor community that extended over the entertainmentsoftware consumerelectronics majorappliance and personalcomputer industries mccollough became president and chief operating officer in  which made him responsible for activities involving human relations and resources management information systems merchandising store operations and planning mccollough became chief executive officer of circuit city in june  a few months before this time the outgoing ceo sharp said of mccollough alans extensive experience in the critical areas of our business his commitment to our highquality consumer offers and his outstanding leadership talents make him the ideal person to guide our company into the next decade january   as ceo mccollough directed the continuing growth and development of both the circuit city and carmax automobile superstore businesses in june  mccollough was elected chairman of the board of directors lagging behind best buy in  upon becoming circuit citys chief executive officer mccollough found the company lagging behind best buy in such financial data as sales sales per square foot and return on investment although both stores saw slower sales in the first half of  best buy doubled its stock value in the same period that circuit city saw its value remain flat mccollough began implementing a detailed plan involving a new store format tests of a standalone applianceonly concept in which a small store would sell only appliances the rolling out of new merchandising displays and continuation of the expanding digitalproduct cycle in consumer electronics circuit city would stock more products on store shelves and place registers near entrances allowing consumers to more easily help themselves to products and to navigate the store in a more efficient manner—what mccollough called a grabandgo climate a combination of commissioned sales counselors and hourly employees were put in rotation at each store this new employment policy contrasted the historically exclusive use of commissioned personnel the switch helped reduce operating expenses mccollough also expanded the number of hightechnology products offered by circuit city outlets including digital cameras millimeter cameras software titles and video games new merchandising displays were created in order to better highlight the products and services available through the various alliances the company maintained with companies such as aol and sony by shifting circuit citys product lines and introducing highermargin newtechnology products mccollough hoped to rely less on sales from computers and other homeoffice products whose profit margins continued to erode eliminating appliances mccollough initiated a plan to eliminate major appliances from the main circuit city locations in order to provide more space on the selling floor and in the warehouse for the expanded product categories while the companys gross margins for appliances were in line with other products the storage and delivery costs of the oversized items were much greater than for smaller products mccollough also added that the appliance category did not have the same growth potential as consumer electronics as the selling of appliances was a cyclical business tied to housing starts and other economic factors mccollough remarked that  percent of customers bought appliances as replacements for older models in the end mccollough found that the company needed an extra  square feet of additional floor space per store in order to accommodate all of the highgrowth products it wanted to sell with lowes home depot sears and other companies all involved in the appliance market mccollough decided it would not be in the companys best interest to pursue further appliance sales in  mccollough opened  new stores and remodeled  to  existing stores each with a new open warehousestyle format—hardwood floors and bright signs replaced the former red black and chrome design scheme and wider aisles higher ceilings and great sight lines were introduced mccollough wanted the bold new atmosphere of circuit city to impress customers from the moment they walked into stores test markets for the consumer electroniconly format included richmond virginia and miami west palm beach tampa fort meyers and orlando florida along with these actions mccollough tested an applianceonly format in six standalone locations in florida mccollough also led circuit city to implement an internetbased training program for storelevel associates yearend results by the beginning of the last quarter of  circuit city continued to lag behind best buy despite mccolloughs initiatives however mccollough continued to believe that the new product cycle format changes and merchandising improvements would help circuit city better compete with best buy by the end of  mccollough saw improvement in sales at existing stores that had undergone remodeling to replace the defunct appliance business mccollough slowed the pace of totalstore overhauls hoping to strengthen the companys brand identity and returns on investment with a less expensive future remodel that of  million per store rather than  million seeing improvement in  mccollough began a new marketing program designed to better communicate circuit citys new look and product offerings to consumers he hired fiona dias as senior vice president of marketing in order to run marketing as a separate division rather than as part of another division as had been done in the past in the first part of  sales lost through the removal of appliances were balanced by overall sales increases resulting from overhauled store layouts and operations later in the year mccollough announced the companys new advertising slogan circuit city—were with you mccollough sought to improve customer service through an overhaul of internal operations—using six sigma an accepted business philosophy fostering customer satisfaction as its guideline still undecided with store formats in  mccollough spun off carmax in the first quarter of  after carmaxs business matured as customers bought used cars rather than new ones during the economic downturn of the early s mccollough hoped that separating the two businesses circuit city and carmax would permit the management of each to better focus on financial and operational objectives with respect to circuit city after a year and a half of testing several formats and programs the company had yet to determine a clearcut remodeling plan for its aging store base mccollough announced that circuit city would redesign three hundred of its stores to house new video departments complete with seating areas for the full hometheater experience to better merchandise the highgrowth television category the company had already been doing this in all newly built stores mccollough later announced that two other formats would also be tested one in chicago illinois and another in the baltimore–washington dc area this announcement caused some disruption on wall street as circuit city had difficulty communicating with the analyst community such issues continued to have adverse affects on the companys stock price and analyst reports  and beyond at the beginning of  mccollough continued to focus on updating circuit citys store base streamlining operations and polishing its consumer image after two full years in a state of transition the chain store seemed unable to move forward mccollough contended that the company had made much progress over those two years although he admitted that the company still had a long way to go before accomplishing its goals after successfully spinning off carmax mccollough abandoned the smaller mallbased circuit city express stores and the standalone appliance concept which had never truly materialized mccolloughs largest focus was on remodeling and redecorating circuit citys existing stores he expanded the homeoffice category complete with personal computers software and accessories and the entertainment software section to help boost foot traffic and bring in younger consumers however wall street analysts were still unsure about the future of circuit city as they waited for the company to finish remodeling its store base and to announce a growth plan analysts felt both projects were long overdue especially considering the opposition of best buy which was far ahead in terms of the executing of a growth plan brand positioning and building of vendor relationships while circuit city had advanced several positive store prototypes other stores remained outdated and poorly suited to the evolving consumerelectronics market over the nine months ending november   circuit city revenues fell  percent to  billion paralleling the weak retailsales environment caused by the general economic slowdown net losses from continuing operations rose  percent to  million reflecting declining grossprofit margins and increased remodeling and relocation expenses mccollough planned to move circuit city to the next phase of its remodeling program in two hundred stores in  however the company had been on the remodeling path for some time and had yet to see improvements in returns see also entry on circuit

foto although we had anticipated modest sales disruption related to our exit from the appliance business and the partial remodel of all stores since the end of september sales have softened significantly in virtually all product categories including those not affected by the remodeling process continued strength of the consumer electronics and home office categories and the recent substantial weakness in major appliances accelerated our decision to reformat all existing superstores continued strength of the consumer electronics and home office categories and the recent substantial weakness in major appliances accelerated our decision to reformat all existing superstores the major appliance business carries high fixed costs and tends to be more cyclical than other retail categories i believe we have made an exciting announcement for the future of our company it will strategically reposition our company to focus exclusively on consumer home office and entertainment i am convinced the time to move forward is now in december we saw strength in a broad number of categories but we saw significant strength in flat panel televisions mp players and accessories notebook computers video game hardware navigation products and imaging products near term we have seen a softening in our business coincident with the onset of the war with iraq we believe the softening reflects consumer preoccupation with geopolitical events it is too early however to understand the impact these events may have on results for the first quarter our record december sales results are further evidence of the great work being done by associates throughout our company more effective advertising improved inventory instock levels and a tightly integrated multichannel offering helped drive the yearoveryear improvement a strong increase in the average ticket size more than offset a reduction in traffic compared with the prior year our record december sales results are further evidence of the great work being done by associates throughout our company they executed an effective holiday season plan which we believe translated into a superior customer experience in all of our sales channels our thoughts and prayers go out to the people who were affected by hurricane katrina our donation is part of circuit citys broader effort to help the victims recover over the summer we made substantial changes to our real estate organization and we still need to improve our real estate portfolio while we expect some increase in the pace of new and relocated store openings in fiscal  compared with fiscal  we expect to derive benefits from these changes in fiscal  and beyond as we work to evolve our store base we also continue to improve designs for our primary superstore format by increasing the proportion of selling space in the stores in addition we have been pleased with results from our  square foot store format and we expect a number of the fiscal  openings will be in this format the firstquarter comparable stores sales growth was slightly ahead of our expectations with sales exceeding our outlook early in the quarter but softening during the final month we believe our guaranteed express pickup offering which enabled customers to shop for christmas gifts over the web through christmas eve was a competitive advantage during the month we remain dissatisfied in the overall sales performance of our circuit city business  no new trends on which to base any charges in earnings expectations we view the additional advertising expense during the quarter as an important investment in building the circuit city brand since our retail stores team held labor expense relatively flat on a dollar basis we were able to gain significant leverage on our higher level of sales as we continued work to optimize the labor model in our storesnordicquotescomnumber of proverbs are varav  p� engelskaproverb  st searchcategories  st search authors  st

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
