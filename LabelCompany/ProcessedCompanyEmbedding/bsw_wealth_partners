empowers and enhances all aspects of their lives message from the founderdebi baydush the life evolution and spirit of our company when i was very young my mother asked only that i do my best i took that message to heart and set out to prove to my grandfather and greatuncle that it wasn’t necessary to be a man to succeed in business and investing my experience with big brokerage houses motivated me to create a clientcentric firm that provided feeonly objective advice a strong independent streak and lessons learned from raising three children drove a firm culture that values being smart exercising compassion and critically important having fun gratifyingly – bsw mirrors that ambition providing a best in class experience for clients colleagues and employees a feeonly model to ensure objectivity and carefully guided conversation that engages challenges and nurtures individuals to tune out noise identify goals then build a plan to achieve them perhaps easier said than done but i do know that having the right partner creates a safe space for honesty thoughtful discussion gives rise to new awareness the dots connect and the endgame comes into sharp focus i myself know the truth of this because two years ago i realized my lifelong dream of a ranch in the mountains off the grid where i live with the freedom to wander where i will in the buff if i please with just the occasional moose or bear to see me having your dreams come true is better than you might imagine and something i hope all of our clients and staff will experience here’s to bsw continuing as a critical partner
