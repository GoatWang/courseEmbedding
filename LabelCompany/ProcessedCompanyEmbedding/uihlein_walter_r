environment that utilizes and develops the creative energies of all associates our objective will be to develop goal directed work teams empowered to anticipate and respond to changing consumermarket conditions destiny is not a matter of chance destiny is a matter of choice history of acushnet company a subsidiary of fortune brands inc achusnet company is devoted to producing golfing equipment and accessories the fairhaven massachusettsbased company boasts three of the most important brands in the industry titleist footjoy and cobra titleist produces the top selling golf ball a favorite of touring professionals for several decades but the logo also adorns other golf products including clubs gloves bags and accessories footjoy is best known for golf shoes and also markets dress and athletic shoes as well as golf gloves and accessories cobras focus is golf clubs but it too makes accessories in addition to eight manufacturing sales and distribution centers located in the united states acushnet also operates facilities in countries across the world including england france germany south africa japan and the peoples republic of china  origins acushnet was founded in  by a graduate of the massachusetts institute of technology phillip w skipper young along with two college friends their partnership was called peabody young  weeks but subsequently became known as acushnet processing company named after the town in which they set up shop acushnet massachusetts although the company soon moved to new bedford massachusetts it retained the acushnet name its original focus was on rubber taking advantage of a process young developed to reconstitute rubber waste and scraps into a workable material acushnet developed a steady business with the major akron ohio rubber companies which sent them their rubber scraps to be processed by the end of world war i in  acushnet was the worlds largest supplier of reclaimed uncured rubber however with the dramatic drop in rubber prices in the early s falling from more than  per pound to just three cents per pound acushnet was forced to shift its focus the company began to produce a number of molded rubber products including bathing shoes and caps toy boats and hot water bottles acushnet became involved in the golfing business because of youngs fondness for and frustration with the game according to company lore he was so dismayed by the inaccuracy of his golf shots one day that he decided to xray some golf balls to see if the cores were properly centered he found that most were well off the mark and prone to erratic shots as a result he decided to develop a better golf ball the first golf balls dating as far back as the th century were made of wood either from elm or beech although durable they were far from aerodynamic and could travel only around  yards next came leather spheres filled with cows hair the first major breakthrough in the evolution of the golf ball was the feathery introduced in  inside its leather sphere painted white for better visibility were goose feathers the ball was packed while wet so that upon drying it would become tight and firm and capable of being driven twice as far as a wooden ball this process was labor intensive and thus resulted in a product that was expensive beyond the reach of average people next came the gutta percha ball developed by reverend adam paterson of st andrews scotland it was made from rubber the name referring to the gutta percha gum used as a raw material the gutta percha ball could be mass produced making golf more affordable but it also had a tendency to break into pieces while in flight then in  coburn haskell introduced a more durable golf ball one that had a solid rubber core around which was wrapped rubber thread that was then enclosed in a gutta percha covering by the early s the haskell ball became the standard in golf as skipper young discovered however the balls were not precisely manufactured introducing the titleist in the s after introducing the xray machine to golfing technology in  young patented a machine that could wind rubber string around a rubber core in a uniform manner which led to the development of a dead center golf ball that he named titleist to demonstrate the effectiveness of his new ball young also developed the first mechanical golf swing machine a twoheaded affair that with its consistent stroke was able to show that there was only a minor variance among individual titleist balls as a result of this foray into the golf ball business acushnet split into two divisions one devoted entirely to golf and the other to the companys remaining rubber products an important decision made early on was to limit the sale of titleist golf balls to golf course pro shops thus attaining a higher margin with the advent of world war ii acushnet shelved its golf business for several years instead devoting its resources to the production of molded gas masks for which the company became the allies sole supplier as well as an oxygen mask developed in conjunction with harvard medical school and important war materials such as torpedo gaskets and orings with the end of the war in  acushnet returned to making golf balls and other consumer products in  the company introduced what it called dynamite thread which along with other refinements resulted in increased yardage a major milestone was reached the following year when titleist became the most played ball at the prestigious us open tournament in the  years following world war ii acushnets golf division grew alongside the popularity of the sport during this span the number of golf courses more than doubled from  to  and the number of people who played  or more rounds of golf each year expanded from  million to  million the amount of money spent on golf equipment increased from around  million to  million onethird of which was spent on golf balls acushnet took steps to maintain its leadership in golf ball technology by launching a research and development team that studied golf ball aerodynamics the company also moved beyond golf balls when in  it acquired john reuter jr inc maker of the popular bulls eye putter in  acushnet added other golf clubs as well as golf bags to its product line by acquiring golfcraft inc it was also during this period in  that the company changed its name from acushnet process company to acushnet company inc while the rubber and golf divisions accounted for an equal share of the companys revenues of  million the golf business proved to be more profitable acushnet became involved in golf carts in  by acquiring shelford group of england a year later acushnet was itself acquired bought by american brands inc a company that was initially involved in the tobacco industry but in time added other consumer products such as sunshine biscuits and james b beam distilling co american brands took the name fortune brands inc in  as a subsidiary of american brands acushnet continued to operate both golf and rubber products divisions for another  years finally in  management from the rubber division bought their operation from the parent company naming it acushnet rubber company inc in  the company dropped the acushnet name choosing instead to call itself precix pronounced precise acushnet the golf subsidiary continued to grow under new ownership and in  added another major brand footjoy the company was just one of dozens of shoemakers operating in brockton massachusetts when it was founded in  as the burt and packard company it was known as the field and flint company in  when it first became involved in the golf shoe business the footjoy line of golf shoes was introduced in the s and received a major boost when the american ryder cup team which played the best europeans in a team tournament selected footjoy as its official shoes by  a majority of professionals on the us pga tour wore footjoys a distinction the company retains until the present day field and flint was acquired by the stone and tarlow families in  as titelist had done earlier new management opted to limit the sale of footjoy golf shoes to pro shops the company took on the name of its signature brand in  dropping field and flint company for footjoy inc in  a controlling interest in the business passed to general mills inc which two years later bought the rest of the company as part of general mills fashion group of companies footjoy became involved in golf gloves in the early s its stasof golf glove becoming the top seller it also added golf socks which also became number one in the category when the corporate parent decided to reorganize to focus on its core businesses a number of suitors made a bid for footjoy including a management group led by richard and william tarlow who had sold the business to general mills ten years earlier as well as converse inc and spalding acushnet emerged the winner paying nearly  million for footjoy not only did acushnet and spalding spar over footjoy the two leading companies in golf equipment spent considerable time in court from  to  hashing out patent issues the initial dispute involved spaldings  patent for a sodium and zinc golf ball cover called surlyn it was a major advance because it prevented excessive cracking titleist and a number of other ball manufacturers adopted the formula and spalding went to court to protect its patent after eight years of litigation a federal judge in  ruled against acushnet while acushnet filed an appeal it sued spalding over patent violations regarding golf ball dimple patterns fluorescent ball covering and golf ball molding finally in november  the two companies settled their differences agreeing to a crosslicensing of patents the s and beyond in  acushnet reorganized its golf business forging a single operating unit titleist and footjoy worldwide a third major brand joined the fold in january  with the acquisition of cobra golf inc maker of hightech golf clubs cobra was a much younger entity than its sister companies it was launched in  by thomas crow a former australian amateur champion who also had  years of experience in golf club design working at melbournebased precision golf crow emigrated to san diego california and launched his own golf club company producing a unique club called the baffler the first utility wood that golfers could rely on to help them escape from especially tricky lies the company then built on a reputation for innovation in the mids it embraced lightweight graphite shafts later it developed the first full sets of oversized irons at first cobra golf inc operated as a separate unit from titleist and footjoy worldwide but in august  acushnets management decided to consolidate the golf club business although the brands continued to maintain separation their operations were combined and streamlined to cut costs and gain efficiencies a year later the titleist and cobra sales forces were also consolidated a move designed to help cobra which lacked a large enough standalone sales force to achieve the level of sales acushnet expected from the brand in  acushnet did away with the two division format opting instead to do business as a single entity acushnet company featuring its three premiere brands in the last two decades of the th century acushnet expanded its golf business internationally in  the company formed a joint venture with tokyo tire and rubber company to distribute titleist products in japan acushnet footjoy thailand ltd was launched in  to manufacture footjoy golf gloves acushnet gmbh became operational in germany in  a year later operations were established in canada sweden france denmark and austria in  acushnet nederland bv was launched followed in  by a joint venture in taiwan to manufacture footjoy golf shoes the acushnet south africa office opened in  finally acushnet singapore pte ltd launched operations in singapore and malaysia in  leading acushnet into the new century was president and ceo walter r uihlein a longtime executive with the company an avid golfer from childhood uihlein went to work at a local pro shop as a teenager he was by his own admission entranced by the image portrayed by the titleist sales rep who was always better dressed than the competition and had the air of the consummate professional one titleist rep jim kernohan took uihlein under his wing and helped him land a job with dunlop after college as soon as a sales job opened up at titleist however uihlein was quick to lobby for the position an enthusiastic and hard worker he quickly made his way up through the ranks hired as a sales rep in  he was promoted to national sales manager little more than a year later by age  he made vicepresident and three years later in  became the youngest general manager in the companys history in  he became president and ceo of titleist and added the chairmanship in  in that same year he became president and ceo of acushnet the emergence of tiger woods in the late s increased golfs popularity and also added to the complexities uihlein faced in leading acushnet into the new century in  woods dropped his endorsement of titleist balls opting instead for the new line of nike golf balls although acushnet lost some sales titleist continued to own a third of the market in fact titleist faced greater challenges elsewhere as a number of other companies began introducing a wide variety of hightech balls titleist kept pace by offering its own advances acushnet as a whole had to contend with increased competition as well as the fallout of poor economic conditions that adversely impacted golf the number of rounds of golf worldwide fell off resulting in a glut of golf balls in inventory in the summer of  acushnet cut nearly  jobs in may  the company announced further cutbacks with another  jobs to be shed over the course of the next year including the elimination of ball
