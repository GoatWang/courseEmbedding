kartsounes and darren hughes after having owned and operated one of chicagos largest and most respected entertainment companies since  scott and darren founded intelligence inc under a simple premise there has to be a better way information packets that cost thousands of dollars in printing and postage contracts that took days to get signed checks that got lost in the mail planning forms that were filled out with illegible handwriting request lists that contained ten times more songs than could be played at a three hour event a booking calendar that was impossible to keep in sync between multiple staff members and an endless stream of marketing dollars spent on yellow pages wedding magazines bridal shows and other advertising that was difficult to track it translated into an overworked staff and an eroding bottom line with degrees in engineering and backgrounds in technology scott and darren set out in  to begin building a system that would solve these problems the uprise of the internet in the late s created the perfect platform for the first version of these tools which allowed clients to log onto their entertainment companys website to book and plan their event though the term cloud computing would not be coined until many years later the results were immediately indisputable clients loved the online bookingplanning platform and the company enjoyed greater efficiencies and lower costs after three years of being inundated with emails from other companies asking whether they could purchase it for their own site scott and darren decided to rebuild the software from the ground up into a fully customizable solution that could be used by any event professional in early  intelligence incs first solution was launched to rave reviews a year and a half later it had grown so large that the entertainment business was sold to dedicate more time to intelligence inc today intelligence inc is staffed by a dedicated team of developers and representatives
