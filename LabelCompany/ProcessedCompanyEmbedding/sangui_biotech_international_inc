further reduced witten germany february   in the first six months of fiscal year  to  sangui biotech international inc achieved revenues from royalty income and product sales of usd  in the same period of the previous year the comparable revenue amounted to usd  due to increased revenues of the wound spray granulox the resulting royalty income in the first half year increased by  compared to the same period of the previous year after a cautious first quarter especially a strong endofyear business was responsible for this development the cost – cutting – and liability – protection program adopted during the last year also had an effect in the reporting period in the first half of the year operating business expenses were reduced by a further usd  or  to usd  as a result of this the operating loss of the first half year decreased compared to the prior year by usd  to usd  accordingly the cash position of the company during the reporting period improved the sales of granulox are subject to seasonal fluctuations as in previous years a strong yearend business was pleasing as planned sales of granulox and royalty income in the following quarter will not reach the level of the previous quarter for the full year  however the company is still expecting the increase in sales of granulox and corresponding royalty revenues sangui bio tech  revenues of usd  in the first halfyear  granulox license income increased by  witten germany january   according to preliminary unaudited figures sangui biotech international inc achieved revenues in the amount of approximately usd  from license fees in the first half year of fiscal  as of december   due to increased revenues of the wound spray granulox the resulting licensing income in the first half year increased by  compared to the same period of the previous year after a cautious first quarter especially a strong endofyear business was responsible for this development particularly pleasing was the fact that the increase in revenues was caused by expanding business with existing partners eg silanes in mexico and not by onetime effects with new contract partners as in previous years we were able to look back on a strong yearend business the development in mexico is more than pleasing the fact that granuloxs foreign revenues have more than doubled over the past  months shows that the business is developing on an increasingly broader basis this effect will be intensified by the planned activities of our partners in southeast asia russia and the uk among others our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations as a result revenues of the following quarter are not expected to reach that of the quarter under report for the full year  however we are counting on the further growth in total revenues for granulox explains michael sander managing director of sastomed gmbh to which sangui biotech gmbh has licensed the worldwide distribution rights for the wound spray granulox sangui bio tech  sastomed enters into sales agreement for turkey  firm purchase commitments agreed  granulox receives product approval in kuwait witten germany december   following the successful integration of the sales regions southeast asia and russia in october this year sastomed gmbh to which sangui biotech gmbh has licensed the worldwide distribution rights for the wound spray granulox has also entered into a sales partnership in turkey with saf pharma health services sa saf a powerful partner for the introduction of granulox in this important territory was won as was already the case with zuellig pharma for southeast asia and the mdp group for russia it was also possible to agree with saf guaranteed minimum purchase commitments for turkey in the course of the next five years saf will in line with the anticipated course of the approval and reimbursement procedure obtain annually increasing minimum volumes with a total volume in the high fivedigit range with turkey a further promising sales region with  million inhabitants could be awarded to an ambitious partner the fact that minimum quantities could be agreed again underscores the confidence of our partners in the successful market launch of granulox says michael sander managing director of sastomed gmbh in december the product approval procedure for granulox in kuweit was successfully completed the product approval is essential for a successful distribution of granulox granulox was therefore approved for the first time in an islamic state this approval demonstrates that the marketing of granulox is also possible in countries which due to religious practices are actually concerned about products containing porcine ingredients outstanding performance from clinical and health economical perspective has convinced local authorities and helped overcome limitations this is an important precedent that supports our efforts in other muslim countries such as indonesia says michel sander sangui bio tech  sales of usd  in the first three months  costs and loss halved witten germany november   in the first three months of fiscal year  to  sangui biotech international inc achieved revenues from royalty income and product sales of usd  in the same period of the previous year the comparable revenue amounted to usd  the cost – cutting – and liability – protection program adopted during the last year shows first success thus the cost of business operations for the quarter could be reduced by usd  or  to usd  as a result of this the operating loss of the quarter decreased compared to the prior year quarter by usd  to usd  accordingly the cash position of the company during the reporting period improved after declining royalty income due to lower turnover of the wound treatment product granulox in previous quarters the company expects for the further development of the fiscal year  rising sales of granulox and accordingly increasing royalty income this forecast is based on the successful integration of new sales partners uk and southeast asia as well as positive developments in already developed sales areas sangui bio tech  sastomed enters into sales agreements for southeast asia poland and russia  firm purchase commitments agreed witten germany november   sastomed gmbh to which sangui biotech gmbh has licensed the worldwide distribution rights for the wound spray granulox concluded a comprehensive licensing and sales agreement for eight southeast asian states with zuellig pharma singapure wwwzuelligpharmacom one of the worlds leading service providers of the pharmaceuticals zuellig pharma is responsible for market launch and distribution of granulox in the territories of hongkong singapore thailand malaysia taiwan vietnam indonesia and the philippines in addition to the complete processing and financing of admission in the individual territories zuellig pharma has committed itself to the purchase of significant quantities of granulox within the next five years furthermore two high – performance distribution partners could be bound hexanova spzoo for poland wwwhexanovapl and mdp group for russia wwwmdpgroupnet in both cases minimum purchase commitments were also been agreed upon with these agreements we have succeeded in pushing forward into new dimensions inside the newly acquired sales areas more than half a billion people live we have now reached an important milestone on our path to global expansion in addition to the quantitative dimension the qualitative contract value of the agreements was also increased in the past five years granulox has proven in field that it keeps what it promises on paper when granting new territories we now benefit from the appreciation granulox has now gained for instance zuellig pharma for southeast asia and the mdp group for russia two veritable global players with a corresponding sales force and financial strength could be obtained for granulox both partners have committed themselves to realize the necessary regulatory approvals and subsequent market launch of granulox in the respective territories guaranteed purchase commitments were agreed with both partners the annual minimum purchase quantities fixed within the next fiveyear period up to  are based on the timestaggered progress of the product launches expected by zuellig pharma and mdp group starting with the approval of granulox followed by the starts of the marketing campaigns and granuloxs positive sales development specific verifiable milestones were established together with our partners for the individual territories the cumulative purchase commitments for quantities over the next five years are well in the middle sixdigit range on the one hand this minimum order gives us further planning certainty and ensures that we achieve our ambitious goals on the other hand this fact underscores the strong confidence our partners have in the future success of the cooperation with sastomed  explains michael sander ceo of sastomed gmbh we congratulate sastomed on these breakthroughs after the inclusion of granulox in the drug tariff of the british nhs at the beginning of october  sastomed herewith has reached further trendsetting successes sangui as licensors for granulox will definitively benefit from these success in this regard the year  can be described as very successful  says thomas striepe president and ceo of sangui biotech international inc according to preliminary unaudited figures sangui biotech international inc generated revenues from royalty income of approximately tusd  during the first quarter of fiscal year  as of september   revenues in the first quarter of fiscal  as of september   amounted to t usd  sangui bio tech  sales of usd  in fiscal year   cost reduction program cost reduction by   annual loss significantly reduced  sales of usd  in the first quarter of fiscal year  witten germany october   as can be seen from the audited consolidated financial statements sangui biotech international inc was able to generate revenues from royalty income and product sales of tusd  in its fiscal year  as of june   in the same period of the previous year the comparable revenues amounted to tusdt this decline was attributable to a decrease in license revenues due to lower turnover of the wound treatment product granulox on the other hand the cost  cutting and liability protection program implemented in the fiscal year had a positive impact the operating expenses for the reporting year were reduced by tusd  or  to tusd  this was mainly due to cost reductions of tusd  in the area of research and development as well as savings at professional fees of tusd  as a result the operating loss of the year under review decreased by tusd  to tusd  compared to the previous year lower cash

countries will join the family of granulox territories along with the czech republic slovakia and hungary like in three scandinavian markets it will be an enterprise belonging to the mediq group which will start initiating the distribution in estonia latvia and lithuania mediq eesti oü wwwmediqee is a wholesale company which has been successfully trading medical and health care products throughout the baltic countries for many years its core business is in medical products and laboratory equipment a care as httpwwwacareczcs was entrusted with the granulox business in the czech republic and in slovakia the company specializes in medical products in particular in the fields of wound management interventional cardiology and radiology as well as neuroradiology halley pharma ltd httphalleypharmacom will look after the hungarian market in which they already distribute a wide array of other wound management products in total there are distribution partnerships in place now for  countries worldwide in  of which granulox is already available for doctors and patients in the remaining  countries market entry is scheduled for the next few months after the training of the sales force will have been completed or after the local registration procedures will have been accomplished respectively which is the case in some central and south american countries shareholder letter witten germany january   dear shareholders today at the beginning of  sangui is in a far better position than twelve months ago though this is not reflected in the share price sastomed gmbh our sales joint venture reported on the stage achieved in the distribution reach of granulox and the sales growth during its financial year  we would like to summarize their report in addition the successful conclusion of the first series of preclinical trials has delivered impressive confirmation of our theoretical approach and we are planning the necessary steps for obtaining certificationlicensing of our hemoglobin hyperpolymers as medical or pharmaceutical products respectively sastomed gmbh raised its granulox sales by   compared with  and anticipates sustained strong growth in  in the words of michael sander sastomeds managing director the reason for the growth is the growing acceptance of the product by the expert community in transnational wound congresses such as the european wound management association held in madrid as well as in the context of many national events the effectiveness of granulox was impressively illustrated using case studies from croatia and serbia across italy and right through to the uk and sweden these events were flanked by similarly broadbased reporting in the media a doubledigit number of specialized publications and case studies known as posters also raised the awareness of patients and therapists in  the process of internationalization is advancing and granulox has already become available as part of the health care system in  countries the product launch in mexico was a special highlight our new mexican partner devoted a whole day to training more than  employees in selling granulox overall for the first time more sales were generated through exports than through domestic business in  in germany plusminus and visite ran tv documentaries which boosted demand from patients however the general problem of a number of health insurance companies not reimbursing the costs of the product has not yet been definitively resolved since sales territories in europe have already largely been covered sastomed has informed us that it will now also be concentrating on expanding outside europe acting on this promising discussions were held in korea at the start of january with further appointments scheduled in the coming months for promoting expansion into india china and russia growth will therefore be driven from two sources in  depending on the degree of market penetration in countries already covered and on the sales uptrend in these countries new sales territories will commence with selling in this context we make renewed reference to market preparation which takes an average of three years before notable revenues can be generated in the relevant territories let us now turn to the preclinical trials with our hemoglobin hyperpolymers the cooperation between our team and the excellence cluster cardiopulmonary system at giessen university eccps is progressing well towards agreed goals in a very constructive atmosphere professors ralph schermuly and ardeshir ghofrani scientific directors at eccps are especially committed as for many years they have both accorded huge importance to septic shock which is our key initial indication and anticipate great benefit from our approach in the first phase which lasted until november  various approaches to hemoglobin formulations produced in our witten laboratory were tested in a process of comparison the formulation labeled sbt  achieved outstanding results as it succeeded in delivering a significant improvement in absolute and relative terms in the oxygenation of the internal organs examined of all the animals treated this makes our sbt  the first product in the wake of a long series of earlier studies by eccps to actually yield a positive effect summarized in the words of the researchers the restoration of intestinal oxygenation will have an impact on tissue integrity and ultimately on patient survival based on this groundbreaking intermediate result we are currently planning and initiating the next tasks together with our partners among other activities this stage involves defining and creating a gmp compatible production process application to other indications which have been jointly envisaged and the detailed planning of the regulatory parameters for certification andor licensing the year  will be important for determining the future direction in any event this milestone raises the issue of financing the further development naturally it is clear to all of us you and ourselves as shareholders that the next steps will entail financing instruments which take the form of an unavoidable placement of further shares from authorized capital you may remember that the capital was authorized by the shareholders in  for this specific purpose and ultimately the market perception will determine the value of the company while the actual number of shares outstanding will then be irrelevant having a higher share price would therefore be helpful and is more than desirable we are convinced that the current share price in no way appropriately reflects the progress made by the company and its prospects based on the success to be achieved in the current financing rounds we are determined to step up our capital markets communication and to improve the position of our share reverse split preparing a prospectus and new stock markets are some of the options the outlook for the company is better than ever we have a product in the market which is already gaining momentum in the market entry phase and we have launched a project with leading scientists that may prove to be life saving for many thousands of people in intensive care it is our firm belief that this is worth fighting for yours sincerely thomas striepe hubertus schmelz joachim fleing   sanguibiotech yields revenues of over usd in q  according to

increasing witten germany may   since  sangui has been pursuing the approach to fight lack of oxygen hypoxia as the ultimate cause of the delay in healing of chronic wounds by applying hemoglobin as oxygen carrier subsequent to the development of a hemoglobin based wound spray which has undergone numerous successful practical trials there is now an easy to use cost saving therapeutic at hand global distribution rights are out licensed to sastomed gmbh who market the spray under the granulox brand name wwwgranuloxde market entry efforts include sensitizing health system especially wound care practitioners as well as the general public for chronic wound issues their causes and the additional healing opportunities offered by this new technology for the first time now the topic of care for chronic wounds meets a higher awareness among the german public recent media reports in german radio wwwdeutschlandfunkdeschwerpunktthemachronischewundendehtmldramarticleid and television wwwdaserstedeinformationwirtschaftboerseplusminussendungndramputationenhtml and wwwndrdefernsehensendungenvisitevisitehtml show that many patients have not been receiving the sort of systematic treatment which does aim at ultimately relieving them of their painful wounds on the contrary the increasing number of amputations indicates that illfocused incentives in the health system lead to inappropriate therapies encumbering the patients rather than providing remedy on the other hand doctors and institutions who were able to gather experience in applying the wound therapeutic continue to administer it to their patients because of the improved healing successes at the german wound congress held in bremen may   a wound expert from nordwest hospital frankfurt germany emphasized that they had already successfully treated more than  patients with the hemoglobin based therapeutic experiences like this contribute to the increasing awareness of the topics of hypoxia and oxygen supply among practitioners and scientists for the first time they were dedicated a key session at the annual congress of the european wound management association ewma held in madrid mai   a topic which was also highlighted by the organizing committee in its introductory remarks the hemoglobin wound spray technology was among the topics dealt with during the key session in the course of the congress as many as eight scientists from different regions presented case studies of successful wound treatments with the hemoglobin based spray the international reach of the wound spray distribution has also increased over the past few weeks sastomed has been able to sign distribution contracts with sales partners in austria denmark norway sweden romania and peru in total closed for  countries on three continents have now been included in the distribution network actual sales were initiated in  countries so far market entry in each country requires registration by the local authorities obtaining the notified bodys approval of the country specific variation as well as the creation of local packaging and documentation except for the comprehensive trainings of the respective local sales force held by sastomed staff members all expenses incurred in the market entry marketing and sales processes are borne by the local partners as soon as the required permissions have been granted the product is being presented to relevant opinion leaders in ambulant and stationary wound care practice as well as to the benefactors such as health insurances this preparatory market entry phase lasts for around one year it is only then that actual sales can be initiated this entails that it may take up to three years from signing the distribution contract until a significant revenue stream can be expected in the respective country the fact that as of now only one year after the signing of the first international contracts sastomed has not only been receiving the usual initial orders but also the first repeat orders may serve as another indicator of the increasing market acceptance of the wound therapeutic and the expectations it raises sastomed is confronted with considerable distributor interest in the few european territories currently not yet covered by distribution agreements sangui regards the progress achieved so far as a sound basis for extending the reach of its wound spray technology even further and for its future success also on the financial side   sangui biotech announces results of the first nine months of its  financial year witten germany may   for the nine months as of

aimed at the characterization of hemoglobin polymers witten germany april   staff members of the excellence cluster cardiopulmonary system eccps have started to carry out in vitro experiments aimed at the biological characterization of sanguis artificial oxygen carrier hemoglobin hyperpolymers in laboratories of giessen university target of the tests are the effects of hemoglobin polymers on the blood pressure in freshly isolated ex vivo perfused and ventilated lungs of mice native hemoglobin positive control and an aqueous colloidelectrolyte solution without hemoglobin negative control will serve as comparison perfusion media all test batches containing hemoglobin are being produced in the sangui laboratories in witten germany sanguibiotech gmbh scientists are accompanying the test series native hemoglobin in the blood plasm generates hypertension as it effects a constriction of the arteries and arterioles of the blood vessel system this happens because it permeates the endothelium of the vessels thereunder it binds and thus removes a messenger substance that serves to relax the blood vessels sangui assumes that the hemoglobin hyperpolymers developed by the company are too big to permeate the vascular endothelium therefore they will not induce hypertension or only to a negligible degree this property is an important precondition for the successful application of a blood additive in the meantime transmit gesellschaft für technologietransfer mbh which is involved in carrying out the project as cocontractor has informed sanguibiotech gmbh that due to changes in the formalities required for the appointment of animal protection officers recently imposed by the district president which had to be adopted beforehand by transmit regrettable delays had occurred in

percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by sastomed from sales of the granulox product based on sastomed selling prices the percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries and thus well above the average licensing rate of  of sales revenues as calculated by market analysts in addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at sastomed will have exceeded the total of € as shareholder

patented wound spray has submitted the announced report covering the first  days of granulox product sales its results meet and in some parts considerably exceed the expectations which were directed at the joint venture company by sanguibiotech gmbh as the licenser sastomed assumes that the initial investments will have amortized by  before that already sangui will participate in each euro of

wound management the communication with opinion leaders and the expert public will now be complemented by an extensive advertising campaign in the consumer media and the internet still personal contact and practical experience are decisive to convince the users as had been expected according to the findings of sangui research and development impressive documentation of successful wound treatments underline the excellent efficacy of granulox in everyday health care practice for some time it had been known among medical researchers that there is a correlation between hypoxia and impeded wound healing thanks to its research focus on oxygen sangui was the first and only company to draw the right conclusions and to develop a hemoglobin based technology which actually and effectively enhances the oxygen supply and thus supports wound therapies the growing dynamics in penetrating the market will even increase further next year according to sastomed overall another  doctors and  hospitals are planned to be gained to regularly administer granulox in germany alone at the same time internationalizing the business will move up on the agenda the current positive experiences made in germany will among others also lead to entrusting the leadership in operating sales in mexico to sastomed  for the sake of a consistent market appearance and in accordance with the mexican partners in parallel market entry in austria the united kingdom and turkey are under preparation additional european markets are planned to be addressed in  the international business will be directed by a top marketing and sales manager with international track record more details will be disclosed after the signing of the final articles of employment hubertus schmelz managing director of

condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report some of the information in this quarterly report contains forwardlooking statements including statements related to anticipated operating results margins growth financial resources capital requirements adequacy of the companys financial resources trends in spending on research and development the development of new markets the development regulatory approval manufacture distribution and commercial acceptance of new products and future product development efforts investors are cautioned that forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may affect our business and prospects including but not limited to the companys expected need for additional funding and the uncertainty of receiving the additional funding changes in economic and market conditions acceptance of our products by the health care and reimbursement communities new development of competitive products and treatments administrative and regulatory approval and related considerations health care legislation and regulation and other factors discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission general our mission is the development of novel and proprietary pharmaceutical medical and cosmetic products we develop our products through our german subsidiary sangui gmbh currently we are seeking to market and sell our products through partnerships with industry partners worldwide our focus has been the development of oxygen carriers capable of providing oxygen transport in humans in the event of acute andor chronic lack of oxygen due to arterial occlusion anemia or blood loss whether due to surgery trauma or other causes as well as in the case of chronic wounds we have thus far focused our development and commercialization efforts on such artificial oxygen carriers by reproducing and synthesizing polymers out of native hemoglobin of defined molecular sizes in addition we have developed external applications of oxygen transporters in the medical and cosmetic fields in the form of sprays for the healing of chronic wounds and of gels and emulsions for the regeneration of the skin a wound dressing that shows outstanding properties in the support of wound healing is distributed by sastomed gmbh a former joint venture company in which we held a share of  as global licensee under the granulox brand name effective end of second quarter of our fiscal year  we sold this stake to sanderstrohmann gmbh sanguibiotech gmbh holds distribution rights for our chitoskin wound pads for the european union and various other countries a european patent has been granted for the production and use of improved chitoskin wound pads our current key business focuses are a selling our existing cosmetics and wound management products by way of licensing through distribution partners or by way of direct sale to end users b identifying additional industrial and distribution partners for our patents production techniques and products and artificial oxygen carriers sanguibiotech gmbh develops several products based on polymers of purified natural porcine hemoglobin with oxygen carrying abilities that are similar to native hemoglobin these are  oxygen carrying blood additives and  oxygen carrying blood volume substitutes during the first quarter of our  financial year the european patent office granted a patent based on sanguis application    mammalian hemoglobin compatible with blood plasma crosslinked and conjugated with polyalkylene oxides as artificial medical oxygen carriers production and use thereof during the third quarter of our  financial year the company had a feasibility study prepared by external experts inquiring into market potentials and further preclinical and clinical development requirements the study came to the conclusion that an approval of sanguis hemoglobin hyperpolymers as a blood additive appears possible expedient and promising during the fourth quarter of our  financial year the company filed a patent application aimed at significantly expanding the protection of our hemoglobin formulations it will encompass a greater array of ischemic conditions of the human body for instance in the case of severe dysfunctions of the lung during the first quarter of our  financial year we began together with excellence cluster cardiopulmonary system eccps and transmit gesellschaft f�r technologietransfer mbh transmit to investigate therapeutic approaches to treating septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the approach adopted here by sangui eccps and transmit presupposes that selfperpetuating septic shock that has so far been highly resistant to treatment can be interrupted by sanguis artificial haemoglobinbased oxygen carrier which would ultimately lower mortality rates the preclinical trials commenced at eccps investigate the effect of various haemoglobin preparations on the oxygen supply of a number of organs in septic shock models and ards also during the first quarter of our financial year  we were notified that the period for objection against european patent ep wound spray elapsed without any objection being raised the patent therefore has become effective and legally binding during the second quarter of our  financial year the first phase of preclinical trials was concluded successfully it could be demonstrated that applying an oxygencarrying liquid the hemoglobin hyperpolymer formulation sbt in the abdomen did significantly improve the oxygen supply to the intestines the restoration of intestinal oxygenation will have an impact on tissue integrity and ultimately on patient survival during the third quarter of our  financial year the preclinical trials were concluded successfully the final results did fully confirm the interim results obtained in the second quarter according to regulatory requirements all drugs must complete preclinical and clinical trials before approval eg federal drug administration approval and market launch the companys management believes that the european and fda approval process will take at a minimum several years to complete our most promising potential product in the area of artificial oxygen carriers the blood additive is still in an early development stage in the pursuit of these projects we will need to obtain substantial additional capital to continue their development the blood additives project was halted in the second quarter of our financial year  due to the lack of financing the further authorization nano formulations for the regeneration of the skin healthy skin is supplied with oxygen both from the inside as well as through diffusion from the outside a lack of oxygen will cause degenerative alterations ranging from premature aging to surface damage and even as extensive as causing open wounds the cause for the lack of oxygen may be a part of the normal aging process but it may also be caused by burns radiation trauma or a medical condition impairment of the blood flow for example caused by diabetes mellitus or by chronic venous insufficiency can also lead to insufficient oxygen supply and the resulting skin damage sales of this series have remained at a low level during the first quarter of the  financial year we decided to decrease our operations in this particular segment and to abandon the patent protection for this range of products chitoskin wound pads usually normal primary wounds tend to heal over a couple of days without leaving scars following a certain sequence of phases burns and certain diseases impede the normal wound healing process resulting in large hardly healing secondary wounds which only close by growing new tissue from the bottom wound dressings serve to safeguard the wound with its highly sensitive new granulation tissue from mechanical damage as well as from infection using the natural polymer chitosan sanguis chitoskin wound dressings show outstanding properties in supporting wound healing it is the strategy of the company to find industry partners ready to acquire or license this product range as a whole hemospray wound spray sanguibiotech gmbh has developed a novel medical technology supporting the healing of chronic wounds lack of oxygen supply to the cells in the wound ground is the main reason why those wounds lose their genuine healing power based on its concept of artificial oxygen carriers our wound spray product bridges the watery wound surface and permits an enhanced afflux of oxygen to the wound ground in december  sanguibiotech gmbh established sastomed gmbh a joint venture company with sanderstrothmann gmbh of georgsmarienh�tte germany sanguibiotech gmbh has granted sastomed gmbh global distribution rights sastomed gmbh started to distribute the product in germany after having obtained the ce mark authorizing the distribution of the wound spray in the countries of the european union in april  as licensor sanguibiotech gmbh is awarded a fixed licensing fee as a percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by sastomed from sales of the granulox product based on sastomed selling prices the percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries and thus well above the average licensing rate of  of sales revenues as calculated by market analysts in addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at sastomed will have exceeded the total of  in september  the mexican health authorities registered the entire current range of sangui developed wound management products and thus granted the authorization to apply and sell these products on a nationwide level on april   sastomed gmbh notified sanguibiotech gmbh that the wound spray product was granted a certification as class iii medical product the ce mark according to sections  and  of the german medical devices act authorizes production distribution and sales of the product in all member countries of the european union according to sastomed gmbh sales of the product under the brand name granulox started in germany on april   other markets will be addressed in due course in august  sangui biotech gmbh and sastomed gmbh cordially adjusted the existing sales strategy in consideration of corresponding contributions the existing licensing contract was partially complemented resulting in the following conditions as licensor sanguibiotech gmbh is awarded a fixed licensing fee as a percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by sastomed from sales of the granulox product based on sastomed selling prices the percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries in addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at sastomed will have exceeded the total of  in december  actual distribution of the product was initiated in mexico under the management of sastomed gmbh and their local distribution partner biomac pharma international distribution has been expanded since then through cooperation agreements with local distribution partners in the benelux countries and south eastern europe in may  the company declared in the course of the filing of its nine month report on form qsb that according to information provided by sastomed gmbh it now expects the granulox market entry phase to last longer than initially expected no assurance can be given that based on royalty revenues the company may reach breakeven in the course of its current financial year since december  international distribution outside germany was initiated in collaboration with local partners in more than  countries in europe and latin american effective december   sangui biotech gmbh sold its stake in sastomed gmbh of  to sanderstrohmann gmbh  also effective december   sanderstrohmann gmbh increased the nominal capital of sastomed gmbh for an amount of euro  to strengthen the capital base of sastomed gmbh it has to be noted however that granulox sales by our distribution partner sastomed gmbh have become more volatile and declining from time to time we remain confident however that sastomed will be able to considerably increase its sales along with more international markets entering actual distribution of the product financial position during the six months ended december   our total assets increased  from  at june   to  at december   an increase in the cash on hand from june   to december   of  was primarily responsible for the increase in the total assets we funded our operations primarily through our existing cash reserves and cash received from the issuance of shares of common stock our stockholders equity deficit decreased by  from  at june   to  at december   the primary factor behind this was due to the issuance of stock for cash and services for  and an increase to accumulated deficit of  as well as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to

and  respectively for the six months ended december   and  revenues were  and  revenues increased by  and  for the three and for the six months ended december   the increase of  from the revenues in the comparable period of our  financial year can be traced back to a increase in royalties from the licensing agreement with sastomed gmbh cost of sales in the first quarter were  and  for the three

cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn

personalized medicine the promise of personalized medicine share tweet link email print phrma’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc in fact research has shown nearly twothirds of nslcs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers like dr zeiher  percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized while the science has never been more complex the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality to learn more about the
