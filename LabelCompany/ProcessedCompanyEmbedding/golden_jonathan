alsogood producti ordered the two tone gold  silver style and i honestly love it its fancy but its not flashy of course if you dont flaunt it this watch is very comfortable its not to heavy and it doesnt slide around to muchbest purchase yet great purchase  in love with the product and amazed at how fast it was shipped to me beautiful watch you will love iti bought the watch for my husband for fathers day he loved he took it to a jewelry store to get two links removed to make it fit better the watch is definitely not an everyday watch but for special occasion i also bought him another jbw watch from another website that one he wears daily jbw makes fabulous watches and overstock makes it affordable keep quality products comingpositivenot what i expected but will serve a purpose the picture made the watch appear to be of better style and quality than actual productsai good product  and a nice deal really worth buying it great producti have been anticipating this product for about  yrs now finally got the product i love the style i would recommend johnson and son watches to watch buyersswiss masterpiecethis is my first edox but based on this beauty it wont be my last i have a wide range of watches from worldrenowned models from affordable brands like citizen and seiko on up through to hamilton tissot raymond weil maurice lacroix and so on and while i dont claim to be any kind of expert i do know enough to know what makes a good watch worth it while some highly upscale brands are really a complete waste of money unless for use of bragging for those that find such to be useful based on providing nothing more in quality than pieces twenty times less in price there are some decent finds in and around a range from  to  that are worth it in some brands despite the fact that for much less than that you can also get what that price range provides in terms of movement materials and styling the difference in the higher priced versions may be subtle but generally you are getting a better movement higher grade of materials and finishing of the details and the heritage behind a more established and respected brand which can often equate to better service in the event servicing is ever needed plus more recognitionrespect among peers if that matters at all while i initially viewed edox watches as overpriced researching the brand changed my mind its just not as well known at all really in the states but it is a wellrespected and wellestablished brand overseas and is actually quite a prize to have on your wrist because of that prestige yes you are paying more for the brand factor but not nearly as much as you would pay for other brands where far far more is being spent on the brand name itself than on what youre actually buying and receiving in terms of a watch the branding element may push the price here slightly but this model proves its definitely getting you more plus this is where smart buying like here on overstock cuts out much of that cost meaning you are getting a prestige watch on a regular joe budget and who needs to know but you so what are you getting well as i say there is the prestigious edox name but this is a case where the brand delivers much much more than just a name the rubber strap with deployment clasp is pure silk it is incredibly comfortable for me i was specifically looking for a square case to add to my watch collection since i own very few and it is always a different look than just the same round styling over and over again the sizing here is perfect not just for comfort but for showing wrist presence without appearing gaudy or crass a genuine swiss quartz heart beats inside with a very unique retrograde movement where for the chronograph the lower hand sweeps and resets to count thirty second intervals which then triggers the minute hand to count and then reset five minute periods which then triggers the hour hand to jump forward five minutes at a time up to one hour of timing its one of the most unique chronograph counters ive seen its a wonder to just sit and watch it work and i really like different movements such as this one which set the watch apart as something quite special water resistance is m appropriate and actually quite good for a luxury watch meaning you can get it wet without worries but its not meant for serious underwater time obviously in terms of the crystal i cant anywhere confirm overstocks description of mineral glass coated with sapphire  every other listing shows this as a true sapphire crystal with antireflective coating which it appears to be so it seems overstock is wrong here lume is very strong on this piece and is generously applied giving it a terrific and readable glow in the dark beyond just the great feel and special movement the styling is stellar in this edition of gold and black with white highlighting on the indices the final result is mesmerizing and beautiful to behold i have a lot of nice looking watches but this is the best of them all this easily rivals custom limited edition pieces paraded around on the pages of robb report or other luxury lifestyle publications but instead of shelling out hundreds of thousands this amazing watch only runs a few thousand at retail prices and here is just under  which is a staggeringly great deal frankly i likely would have saved up and sprung for this at a thousand or more just because its such a gorgeous watch but at the cost here i ordered it the moment i found it this is truly a deal of epic magnitude to get this watch for this price in person it is just somewhat jaw dropping and if youre looking to enter the world of high end swiss watches there could be no better point of entry youll outshine everyone else at the luxury watch table and only you need to know that you only spent hundreds instead of tens of thousands for your treasure the details and finishing on this watch are absolutely top notch and this is just a huge step beyond any of the usual affordable swiss lines giving you a truly elite time piece that honestly is far more compelling even than what is considered to be higher end swiss brands which while rich in brand recognition tend to honestly just look pretty boring in terms of styling this is a watch set apart for sure and it will set you apart in your ownership of it cousins of this variant ran as high as  for a chiming minute repeater version  for the automatic model and even this quartz one elsewhere usually starts at double what its going for here so this is definitely an impressive time keeper and id encourage you to get it not just for the incredible deal but also because it is now out of production so eventually they will be gone this one has certainly sold me on the edox brand research is one thing but seeing and wearing this in person has convinced me that edox is a rare find providing for only several thousand dollars or much less here the kind of watches that ordinarily can cost as much as a car or even a house i cant recommend this more highly and frankly for those seeking a square case id go as far as to say this is one of the best versions made if you want to make a statement of elite quality this classe royale says it all great watchthis was my first purchase off oscom and of a stuhrling watch i am happy to say that the watch i received in the mail looked much better than the images on the site they just dont convey the beauty of the piece i waited over a month before i wrote this because i wanted to be able to give an accurate review of the product as i stated above the images do not accurately convey the true esthetics of the piece the watch is rather large and takes some getting use to since it is automatic if it is not wore daily it will stop that being said i do not wear it overnight and it keeps time fine overnight wo stopping or slowing down the downsides there were and are a couple very small gold flakes loose under the glass also on the face there is a small rough patch that looks unpolished that being said both issues are only noticeable when looking very closely at the watch and probably arent present on all pieces i paid about  for the watch i noticed the price at the moment is about  i dont know if the price went down because of the holidays but i would say take advantage of the low price it is well worth it recommendation buysponsored linkswhats this jonathan product

product team — airbnb’s first pm on how to build your own tweet share post savejonathan golden airbnb’s very first product manager and now director of product knows that flexibility can get you far in his line of work last year it even got him to cubawhile the island nation had always been effectively closed to airbnb the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the us in  opened a door — a door the company’s leaders wanted to walk through quickly “we thought it was important to incorporate that community into the world and into the airbnb ecosystem” says goldenany number of airbnb teams could have added the cuba project to their existing workload but given the unique challenges of entering the highly restricted market and managing money transfers that would have taken too long so the decision was made to build a new dedicated team which landed in the payments organization that golden helmsin  weeks a crossfunctional team — product managers designers engineers and data scientists reallocated from elsewhere in the org — was assembled there was extensive support from other areas of the company including legal operations and comms it was a herculean task for everyone who worked crossfunctionally but two months later the initial infrastructure was up and running in cuba and almost as quickly as it formed the team was disbanded with the ongoing work of maintaining cuban business doled out to existing product areasan unusual case maybe but it’s emblematic of the elastic visiondriven product management approach that has allowed airbnb to reimagine travel in this exclusive interview golden describes how to build highimpact modular teams driven by actual needs he walks through the decisionmaking framework that he uses to allocate the hottest of commodities engineers and he explains why — when everyone is working toward a clear company objective — having teams that expand and contract actually keeps you alignedstep  make sure your vision is fully articulatedif golden could share just one organizing principle it would be this design your product teams around outcomes not featuresthis is where defining a clear vision comes in too many teams skip this step because they want to get to the concrete work and not waste their time with touchyfeely goalsetting when you do this you end up wasting a lot more time“a lot of people call me and ask how they should structure their product organizations i always tell them to do it based on outcome if you do it based on features then you’re going to be perpetuating those features whether they’re useful or not” your company vision is what you want the world to look like in fiveplus years — outcomes are the team mandates that will help you get there “outcomes define what we want to achieve for people in our community” says golden more context on this lateryour product vision and the team outcomes it spins out aren’t pieinthesky talk reserved for board meetings and investor pitches it’s as important to your company’s daytoday functioning as your site metrics or revenue — and like those numbers you should communicate it clearly and oftenfor example airbnb’s vision for the payments team is to “create a world where connections between people become less transactional and more human” by bringing the transactional element of payment between guests and hosts online the team makes the process as seamless as possible and allows the community to engage in more meaningful ways but this is a challenge that’s ongoing — golden knows there’s more to do to achieve this greater objective in the meantime the more immediate mission is a helpful tool “to build an accurate and extensible global payments platform that provides a frictionless experience for guests hosts and partners”that’s not to say that you need to identify a vision that will take your company all the way from series a to ipo frankly you probably couldn’t if you wanted to your product vision will evolve for any number of reasons — changes in your business needs or the community you serve for example or simply because you’ve refined what you set out to buildthe excitement of a consumer technology startup is that the business and environment around you is changing so fast you must respond in kindkeep your product vision dynamic and rearticulate where you’re going on a regular basis“i’m sure mark zuckerberg in the early days didn’t think facebook was going to be as big as it is today” golden says “now they’re able to think so much more expansively about connecting the world in a very meaningful way but they’ve only achieved that because they were able to slowly expand that vision as they moved forward through a number of outcomes”golden advises founders to focus initially on the things that are working and grow into their product vision organically “i’ve seen company scope expand too quickly” he says “normally if something is working and you double down on that then whatever you are measuring will dramatically accelerate if something is only half working and you need to go do something else to achieve your goal then maybe it really wasn’t working as well as you had thought”step  build modular teams for maximum flexibilityairbnb optimizes for agility first and foremost by assembling interdisciplinary product teams the notion of a group of product managers sitting together in a bullpen apart from the rest of the organization is anathema instead product managers are matched with engineers designers and data scientists to attack business problems from all sidesif people collaborating on the same project are disjointed or they’re not always interacting then a lot of the magic of creativity is going to get lostthis modular team structure is how airbnb has managed to keep the spirit of an earlystage startup as it’s grown into a tech giant “in the early days we used to have one big meeting with all of engineering all of design all of data science and all of product management in one room of course at the time that was maybe  people” says golden “we’ve evolved from there but we kept the core of how the team operated”there’s no feeling of rank within each team and no room for prima donnas “everybody has the same ownership of impact across data design engineering and product ” if a team needs to communicate something to the rest of the company it selects the appropriate lead — a data scientist for example would communicate the results of a major ab experiment “it’s a team that operates cohesively versus one person who’s potentially more of a totalitarian leader”step  hire these  types of pms — you’ll need them allwhile building modular product teams startups also need to staff for their stage when you’re pushing toward productmarket fit you’ll need a very different “type” of pm than when you’re scaling or later when you achieve scale and move on to platform initiatives each of those key stages is best tackled by one of three archetypal product managers a perennially useful framework golden notes first developed by simon wardley adapted it from concepts in robert x cringely’s  book accidental empirespioneersthese are people who are excited by building prototypes who are pumped about the riskiness of the endeavor and when creating something brand new in the world” says golden sound a lot like a founder that’s not a coincidence founders are typically their companies’ first product person — the ultimate pioneer but whether you bring it to the table yourself or hire for it this is the type of pm energy a company needs at the starthow to spot them these risktaking frontliners need to be scrappy so look for someone who has entrepreneurial experience already that might be someone who was ceo of his or her own company or even a pm who led an exploratory team for a large company the lead for a new product area at google for example don’t however assume that any startup experience equals pioneer experience “there is a huge difference between somebody who has built something and somebody who has maintained something” says goldenhere are the questions he recommends asking to determine if a product manager has pioneer potential what is your process for uncovering user needs how do you know if you’ve achieved product market fit tell me a time when you did something nonscalable to jumpstart a product i’m thinking about building “x” — what do you do to get it built in  daysfor each of these questions you’re looking for responses that are both thoughtful and concise beware candidates who talk in circles or provide a lot of unnecessary context they should have a clear sense of what they’d say in each situation and be able to communicate it clearly and their explanations should dovetail with the cadence speed and culture of your companysettlersonce you achieve productmarket fit your focus needs to shift from starting a company to building one and to scale you need settlers “these product managers are much more focused on impact they really care about reaching a lot of people that’s a slightly different makeup they’re obsessed with growth they’re obsessed with optimizing”settlers can come from a variety of backgrounds most times they are highly analytical and have an uncanny ability to work hand in hand with data science large consumer internet companies have many settlers who work on refining and optimizing product experienceshow to spot them look for someone who finds the creativity in ab testing someone who’s driven by metrics and can tell you exactly how they’d measure the impact of a new featurehere are the other questions golden recommends asking to determine if a product manager is a natural settler how would you break down our conversion funnel how do you like to set up an ab test we have a feature “x” — what is the use case for the feature and how would you measure it tell me about a time you influenced user behavior through producttown plannersthese are your platform managers who take over when it’s time to build the infrastructure and systems necessary to handle scale and accommodate your product’s use cases current and futuregood town planners are also entrepreneurs many town planners have technical backgrounds but that is not a hard requirement they can also work with technical visionaries where the product manager can steer the vision to realize its practicality for the broader product team at airbnb they added product management support to the core infrastructure teams to help them build technical tools to set the business up for scale through the next few yearshow to spot them “town planners must be able to synthesize large amounts of disparate information to build technology that will service existing and unanticipated use cases” says golden don’t just look for workhorses who can lay down a solid backend foundation—these pms also need a vision for the future product initiatives that foundation could supporthere’s what to ask to figure out if someone has the capacity to be a town planner what metric would you measure to determine success for a platform product tell me about a time when you built a system that supported a variety of use cases how do you balance building toward known cases versus unknown future use cases how do you know i the platform is too rigid or too flexiblea brandnew enterprise needs to know when to bring on the next wave of product management but even in an established company all three types of product managers are critical “the product team needs each of these pms to be nimble and responsive otherwise the business won’t endure for the long term” says golden “we allocate product resources across three main categories core initiatives that focus on the existing product new initiatives that explore possible areas of growth for the business and platform initiatives that focus on building fundamental technological infrastructure” pioneers and settlers don’t become obsolete just because you’re at scaleand town building isn’t the end of the road — it’s just the groundwork for a new round of pioneering golden’s payments team for example is primarily tasked with building a platform but since the exchange of funds touches everything the company does his team also contributes to many of airbnb’s new guest and host conversations “we’re always thinking ‘okay how do we take the system that we’ve built which is moving a lot of money around the world right now to think about where the business is going’”done right the work of these three types of pms forms a loop that makes the difference between a billiondollar company and a onehit wonderstep  demystify resourcing projects with clear process“a product team needs to evolve with the product how people use the product and environment around the business” says golden “it needs to have a culture of constant change” but how do you know when it’s time to effect that change for that you’ll need one more building block a consistent framework for setting and measuring goals because without a process for testing hypotheses you may quickly find that you’re not so much iterating as spinning your wheelsfor golden and product leadership at airbnb that process looks something like thisby the time you reach the bottom of this flowchart resourcing decisions may not be easy but they’ll be clearer“everybody always wants more resources” says golden “for the most part nobody is saying ‘i’m fine i don’t need to grow’ people feel like their work can be contributing to the product to the community and in a highgrowth company that’s usually true” product managers then need to work with founders and other company leaders to establish prioritiesit’s very much a pm’s role to decide which bets to placeworking through this process chart though is not a oneanddone proposition “you need to constantly revisit and challenge core fundamental assumptions to make sure that you’re making the right decisions based on what we know as factual today” says goldenevery quarter he conducts a review of each of his teams to determine the impact they’re having on the business and whether they’re hitting their goals “we say ‘okay if this team is established and we’ve articulated all our goals and we didn’t hit one — or for some reason something is off — why are we off what happened’” once again he starts at the top of the chart “the first question is ‘did this product or project actually fit into the product vision’ usually it does but other times we’ve had to be uncomfortably honest”take airbnb’s wish list feature for example which was originally conceived as a singleuser “favorites” tool “but most trips on airbnb have more than one person and once it was in use we saw that we weren’t actually addressing the real need which was for sharing favorites and choosing the best place to stay as a group” says goldenby the time the tool was relaunched this year the product vision had been torn down and rebuilt “we had to take a step back to say ‘okay is this actually what we want the product to be does it change our people’s behavior in a positive way’” armed with a new product vision one informed by data the team reinvented wish list as a collaborative tool for planning trips and saw a significant jump in usageif your product or project still does address the vision though keep moving down the planning framework “at the end of the day if you realize that a project isn’t succeeding purely because your metric isn’t hitting the goal normally the culprit is resourcing” says golden and that’s a clear cue to look at realigning the team’s resourcesstep  rally teams quickly and scrap them when necessary“if you have a culture of iteration and a team that is flexible and includes a balance of the three types of product managers then realignment is expected every so often it’s not controversial” says goldenwhether you’ve identified a team that’s understaffed have surfaced new problems that can’t be addressed by existing teams or want to double down on a nascent opportunity don’t shy away from moving people where they’ll be most valuabletake internationalization for example cuba was not the first time airbnb’s goals have required that kind of elastic team building when the company did its first big push into international markets in  a team was spun up to manage a new set of challenges translation new payment systems and ui changes among them and as with cuba once those systems and platforms were in place the tasks of maintaining them were once again distributed across the rest of the organizationtoday the company is reassembling an internationalization team to tackle its latest new markets “the team has moved from ’s translation and content localization to developing deeper more culturally localized product experiences in these markets we need a dedicated team to think through those issues”it’s clear why a company might want to whip up a product team from scratch but what about the howwhen a product manager is engaged with a given team how do you sell her on dropping everything to tackle a new challenge if you’ve established a visionbased company culture this is where you’ll really reap the rewards teams will be bought in to accomplishing a goal not bringing a particular feature or product to market “if you’ve done it right from the getgo—articulated your vision outcome and goals right — it should be much easier to have a conversation about reallocating human resources” says goldendecommissioning a team is often the harder side of this equation but there too let your product vision serve as a touchstone take the team through your goalsetting framework and identify where things went wrong or changed was it a flaw in the product vision strategy goal metrics or resourcing “if you go through that process then the team gets much more comfortable with the reason things didn’t work out as well as they thought” says golden moreover in an iterative product management culture individuals have less to fearyou can’t achieve a real culture of iteration without accepting failure “the key to postmortems is obviously to not point fingers it’s all about lessons learned and identifying why things happened the way they did”from  to  golden managed a team that focused on user tools they handled all guest and host interactions after the booking and tackled many issues around reservation alterations refunds and cancellations but they didn’t have a clear mission that related to an outcome“we realized that it would be best to disperse the team into two outcome oriented teams — the booking flow team and the host team” he says “this enabled these two teams to realize their mandate through a wider but yet overall more simplistic scope”important reminder you must repeat yourself to make any of this worksure airbnb has reached a scale that few startups do — but golden is not as far removed from the earlystage days as you might think “as airbnb’s product organization expands each team is actually starting to look like airbnb did a couple of years ago those teams are getting to a size where they’re almost earlystage startup companies on their own” he says and like any good startup leader golden knows that the key to keeping his teams humming is constant communicationto that end he hews closely to three simple pillars process context and listening process having a clear framework for making company decisions as we’ve seen is key transparently discussing the results of that process is too context a clear vision isn’t enough though you need to make sure everyone on the team sees that vision too don’t be afraid to repeat yourself in fact be sure to repeat yourself “you have to communicate it all the time” says golden “and as new people join the team tell them the history of how things evolved that context is usually really helpful” listening as a team leader golden is also acutely aware that his communication responsibilities go both ways just as he repeatedly shares the company’s vision with his team he also contributes his teams’ feedback to leadership’s ongoing vision making “you’re not going to be able to make the best decisions without actually talking to individual people and making sure that you’re addressing their concerns”“it’s the job of a team lead — whether in product engineering design or data — to communicate the what and the why but if people don’t agree then you have to revisit them anybody can push back challenging core fundamental assumptions is really healthy”beyond these three tenets of communication golden is not one to dictate how often teams should meet with each other or how they manage their internal messaging “we allow each team to figure out their own cadence their own process and structure we like to see each team have it’s own character—a little bit of identity”when you do the work of establishing a missiondriven culture you can afford to be flexible on the details“again much of the work of product management is making sure everybody understands the what and the why he says leaving it up to teams to figure out how to actually make that happen empowers them to do better and find more meaning in their work i think everyone wants a say in their daily work — that’s not just in tech land that’s in life”recommended articlesfirst round talentaccess

out of  a good read for those who need inspiration february   loveread quality  value  meets expectations  today we are brought a new book courtesy of jonathan david golden it was an interesting read and was filled with helpful tips for those who do not feel like they are living a life that makes them feel alive jonathans story was encouraging to read as it detailed a regular guy and his journey to listening to the lord for people like myself going out on a limb and following the lords crazy callings is not easy and this book encouraged me to be more bold i enjoyed tracking the humble beginnings of jonathans coffee company and seeing it grow over time into a company that is growing into a profitable business i would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take the next step in their life or feels stuck in a rut i am not really into selfhelp books as a rule but this was easy for me to read his personal life stories made it much more interesting to me and didnt feel like it was an impersonal list of things i need to do to get better i would give this book  stars this book was provided to me by baker books in exchange for my honest opinion was this review helpful helpful

questions this one goes beyond what do you want to be when you grow up to who do you want to be jonathan golden has an impressive resume but shares how his accomplishments dont mean anything without purpose behind them i deeply resonated with his drive to do more than just what was expected or what looked good he speaks throughout his book of the quiet faithfulness behind real transformation doing things little by little i love the courage he speaks of to start doing the things that make you come alive every calling begins with one brave step  he gives permission for the unconventional

inappropriate bekah  stars out of  did not connect with me february   bekah quality  value  meets expectations  earlier this year i asked to review an amish fiction book by mistake i received jonathan david goldens book be you do good i was told i could read it or pass it on since it had been sent in error i decided maybe the mistake wasnt so much of a mistake and i should read the book the subtitle is having the guts to pursue what makes you come alive and since im still in my first year of career change and new paths i thought perhaps this would offer me something really pivotal to help me in my journey i was so sad when i finally closed the book because it wasnt my favorite i pondered just skipping the review entirely because i didnt want to say something negative but i decided to go ahead with it believing that part of being a book reviewer is knowing every book might not zing me and being okay with admitting when one does not jonathan is the founder of a successful business called land of a thousand hills coffee company  it was much more of a business book than a christian living book in my opinion though it is marketed as christian living the copy on the back of the book indicates that anyone looking to make a career out of their life calling can learn from the book but i did not find it to be a good fit for me make no mistake his stories are interesting and there is much to learn about the country of rwanda and the coffee business through reading the pages but i just ached for a little bit more guidance and a little bit less story if youre a businessminded person and you aspire to head a corporation someday this actually might be a great book for you it just wasnt for me and i was sorry for that  i received this book from baker in
