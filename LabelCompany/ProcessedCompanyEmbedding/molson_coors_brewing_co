brewing company nysetap still looks strong despite the fact that it is trading near week lows therefore it may be a good time to start a long position or to lower your average cost if you are already an investor in tap i think molson coors will be on the rise heading into its secondquarter earnings which will be announced on august nd it may be a good idea to jump on board the companys comeback now as it is trading near week lows hovering around  per share as the stock price is down almost  year to date recently on june th the stock price plunged  after molson coors announced it was lowering its ebitda guidance this comes after it rose about  after the companys firstquarter earnings report so what should we make of this recent price movement and what can we expect in the future purchase of millercoors it is important to remember that molson coors acquired the remaining  stake in millercoors during the middle of october  for  billion from sabmiller millercoors was a joint venture between molson coors and sabmiller that was formed in  by becoming the sole owner of millercoors molson coors has established itself as one of the largest brewers in the us and canada this is the main reason to like the company long term ceo mark hunter explains the value of this acquisition when he stated as one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands and a highly focused leadership team we intend to leverage our increased scale resources and combined commercial experience to accelerate our first choice agenda and deliver long term shareholder value the company doubled in size as a result of this deal giving it the capacity and control needed to compete in a globalized industry the purchase of millercoors gave molson coors the right to sell the miller lite miller high life and miller legacy brands its staple products now include coors light molson canadian miller lite blue moon henrys hard soda redds hard ciders keystone leinenkugels and more past annual performance  the company did not show great numbers in its  annual earnings report this was mark hunters first year at the helm and sales globally were flat in comparison to  the margin between net sales and cost of goods sold was also significantly tighter than in the year prior another contributor to the sales drop in  was the emergence of regional brewers and microbreweries especially in canada the beer industry as whole had a weak  as well by the end of  worldwide beer volume decreased  and net sales per hectoliter decreased  net income from continuing operations decreased  and underlying aftertax income decreased  from the previous year underlying ebitda also decreased  from the previous year the company suspended its  billion stock repurchase program in the fourth quarter of  as well pertaining to these losses in  it said underlying full year results were lower than prior year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency movements increased brand investments and the impact of terminated business contracts management did not seem too concerned with the companys performance or future prospects because they were already in talks to acquire the remainder of millercoors at this point molsoncoors was the fourthlargest brewer behind anheuserbusch nysebud sabmiller and heineken otcqxheiny anheuserbusch flexed its muscles in  by acquiring sabmiller this transformed it into an even bigger conglomerate and ate away at some market share in the beer industry i think it is safe to say the molson coors had a less than desirable year in   the company saw large improvements through  sales increased by over  billion in just one year and its operating income more than tripled this of course was mostly due to the purchase of millercoors from sabmiller but the company also saw growth in domestic and international volume its operating income also grew substantially because molson coors could now consolidate the supply chain this enabled the company to completely control costs and become more efficient at the end of  tap reported a net income of  billion after reporting only  million in net income in  side by side it seems that molson coors had an extraordinary  in comparison to years past this is obviously deceiving as the insanely high income came at a  billion price tag to buy millercoors it is important to realize that tap did not have an amazing year in  it simply became a larger company it has  billion debt and it will take the company quite a few years to pay off that debt making around  billion a year in net income the reason why the companys sales and net income grew by so much in  was because of its acquisition of millercoors which gave it the ability to sell all of the miller brands this increased taps brand volume and cut costs tremendously while the company as a whole received much more exposure in the beer industry tap increased its market share in canada to  and its market share in the us grew to  molson coors international also grew by almost  year to date the k form from the end  also reported that the company had  million in free cash flow which can be useful for growth initiatives for  and beyond the free cash flow may be key to keeping up with its large competitors eps also grew from  in  to  in   again this was due to the purchase of the miller brands therefore you should not expect eps for the end of  to be anywhere near those levels current eps estimates for the end of the year are about  per share  firstquarter earnings report molson coors firstquarter earnings report in  showed a  increase in brand volume sales in canada increased  million or  and sales in the united states rose  to  million however the company saw a  ebitda decline to  million and it just lowered ebitda guidance as well the ceo made this forwardlooking statement during the firstquarter conference call despite the softer start to the year volume trends have improved recently we are making great progress with our first choice agenda in all of our businesses and we are confident of our fullyear business plans additionally we are generating cash ahead of our original expectations with the completion of the millercoors transaction late last year and the changes we are making to align and enhance our organization  will be a transition year as we build a larger stronger company consistent with this our results today reflect increased investments in the building blocks that will drive topline growth profit cash generation debt paydown and total shareholder returns in the years ahead the ceo also seems confident that company is poised for growth the betterthanexpected generation of cash is certainly positive news and will help the company continue to increase its market share the description of  as a transition year could have a negative connotation but i believe it is an indicator that molson coors is becoming flexible and adapting to market changes for a longterm investor this should be a good sign because molson coors is active in a de facto arms race against the oligopoly of anheuserbusch tap data by ycharts if you look at molson coors threeyear chart it seems like the company is reverting back to levels from about a year and a half ago before its big expenditure making this a decent buying opportunity key figures and financial ratios molson coors has a market cap of  billion which is the third largest in the industry heinekens  billion market cap and the massive  billion market cap of anheuserbusch lead the way in relation to its peers molson coors has a low pe ratio at about x that being said it does have a forward pe of around x this is an interesting statistic because this is its lowest pe ratio in  years the reason why this number can be misleading is because it is based on the trailing twelvemonth eps of  for the first quarter of  molson coors reported eps of  it is therefore a probability that its eps at the end of  will drop to around  or  per share it is also likely that the pe number will grow by the end of the year if its share price goes up and the eps goes down  which is something i expect to happen  their pe will go up this alone should look attractive for investors because they should look to enter at these levels where the pe is too low an eps drop from last year should be expected as the company adjusts to its larger size therefore i think the share price will rise even with an eps drop the pe ratio seems misleading at these levels and it could very well be a sign of a further decline in growth though i believe that argument is convoluted because i see molson coors pe as signal that the company is undervalued it does look relatively undervalued in the industry right now because the industry average pe ratio is around x molson coors also has a peg ratio of  which not too far off of the ideal peg ratio of  the peg ratio says that the company is valued at a relatively fair price source investopedia these charts can be interpreted in several different ways one being that molson coors is somewhat lagging in the industry with a notably low ebitda i see it as the company being undervalued because it is an industry leader in net margin return on assets and return on equity yet it still has a low pe ratio this makes the share price seem low at the level it is trading at right now company health when it comes to financial health molson coors may be less liquid than competitors the company has a lower quick and current ratio than a conservative investor is probably looking for its financial leverage is not too risky but it has increased due to the recent acquisition source investopedia at these prices tap may be a good stock to own for the long run as it currently has a  beta making it not too risky in theory the company also has  dividend which it has been raising every two years the companys purchase of millercoors will benefit it in the long run and eventually increase its ebitda numbers to go along with the continued sales increases molson coors is already generating more cash than expected which should ease the nerves at least a little bit risk factors scathing competition can force the company to lose sales volume which is the main reason it lowered ebitda guidance at the beginning of june molson coors debt levels significantly rose in  due to the acquisition of sabmiller and failure to realize debt obligations could result in significant losses overall beer consumption in the us has been declining since  and may well continue on that path the company does need to focus more on taking away market share from its biggest competitors anheuserbusch boston beer co nysesam heineken and more the competitive landscape is my biggest concern when it comes to investing in tap and i am sure other investors would probably agree the over  billion market cap of bud and its purchase of sabmiller is concerning it is the clear powerhouse in the beer industry and that will probably hold true for years to come that being said molson coors has shown that it refuses to back down if these risk factors become more prevalent it could have a trickledown effect because losing sales to competitors or the decline in beer consumption could cause the company to default on its debt leading to a smaller ebitda number and continued losses for investors as seen from the  drop in june ebitda guidance is strong mover of this stock however that is the worstcase scenario and probably will not happen future expectations twelve analysts have predicted taps month future i agree with the median price consensus and it may be realistic to see molson coors back over  per share assuming strong earnings reports and at least back into the  range assuming average financial reports institutional investors are confident too as molson coors is also owned by  hedge funds with  billion in positions analysts expect eps of  per share during the second quarter of  with a consensus of  earnings per share these estimates have been raised from three months ago and i still would not be surprised if tap beats these numbers on august nd trading below  per share tap looks attractive in addition the global beer market is projected to see nearly  billion in sales and a  compounded annual growth rate cagr by  international sales will hopefully offset the domestic decline in beer consumption and keep molson coors on track for continued growth conclusion i believe molson coors and its investors will be rewarded in the future by its purchase of millercoors the company already came out and said it is generating more cash than expected i also believe that the possibilities of this deal are immeasurable at the moment and therefore are not factored into the share price competition in the beer industry is a major cause for concern as anheuserbusch and heineken are currently much larger players than molson coors and have the capacity to suppress it that being said i think that molson coors will be able to compete and show solid growth in the future right now it seems to be undervalued and looks like a good buying opportunity it may be a good idea to start a small position now with additions to that position once the company proves it can boost its ebitda numbers and grow in a competitive industry disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may

california and texas were part of the state distribution area washington and montana were not added until   oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until  this gave it mystique and made it a

year old striking workers could not vote in the election labor unions organized a boycott to punish coors for its labor practices one tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer because coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer such laws would hurt only coors sales of coors suffered during the decadelong labor union boycott although coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industrywide downturn in beer sales and to increased competition to maintain

the brewery prohibitionedit ad for coors malted milk produced in  the coors brewing company managed to survive prohibition relatively intact years before the volstead act went into effect nationwide adolph coors with sons adolph jr grover and herman established the adolph coors brewing and manufacturing company which included herold porcelain and other ventures the brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility coors sold much of the malted milk to the mars candy company for the production of sweets manna the companys nonalcoholic beer replacement was a near beer similar to current nonalcoholic beverages however coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the coors brewing company afloat by  after the end of prohibition the coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived all of the nonbrewery assets of the adolph coors company were spun off between  and  the descendant of the original herold porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as coorstek productsedit for much of its history coors beer was a regional product and its marketing area was confined to the american west while california and texas were part of the state distribution area washington and montana were not added until   oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until  this gave it mystique and made it a novelty particularly on the east coast and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case this iconic status was reflected in the  movie smokey and the bandit which centered around an illegal shipment of coors from texas to georgia the company finally established nationwide distribution in the united states in the mids in  coors became the first american brewer to use an allaluminum twopiece beverage can also in  the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world known as the rocky mountain metal container rmmc in golden rmmc is a joint venture between ball metal and coors having been founded in  in the s coors invented the litterfree push tab can in place of the ring pulltab however consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward coors light was introduced in  the longtime slogan of silver bullet to describe it does not describe the beer but rather the silvercolored can in which the beer is packaged coors light was once produced in yellowbellied cans like the fullstrength coors

brewery workers union at coors representing  employees went on strike the brewery kept operating with supervisors and  to  union members including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike soon after coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers about  workers quit the picket line to go back to work and coors replaced the remaining  workers keeping the beer production process uninterrupted in december  the workers at coors voted by greater than a twotoone ratio to decertify the union ending  years of union representation at coors because the strike was by then more than a year old striking workers could not vote in the election labor unions organized a boycott to punish coors for its labor practices one tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer because coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer such laws would hurt only coors sales of coors suffered during the decadelong labor union boycott although coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industrywide downturn in beer sales and to increased competition to maintain production coors expanded its sales area from the  western states to which it had marketed for years to nationwide distribution this was completed in  with indiana being the last state for the brand to appear the aflcio ended its boycott of coors in august  after negotiations with pete coors head of brewery operations the details of the settlement were not divulged but were said to include an early union representation election in colorado and use of union workers to build the new coors brewery in virginia in  the teamsters union which represented brewery workers at the top three us beer makers at the time anheuserbusch miller and stroh gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the coors company coors workers again rejected union

confined to the american west while california and texas were part of the state distribution area washington and montana were not added until   oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until  this gave it mystique and made it a novelty particularly on the east coast and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case this iconic status was reflected in the  movie

the beer production process uninterrupted in december  the workers at coors voted by greater than a twotoone ratio to decertify the union ending  years of union representation at coors because the strike was by then more than a year old striking workers could not vote in the election labor unions organized a boycott to punish coors for its labor practices one tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer because coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer such laws would
