map sls management llc issues letter to abercrombie  fitch co identifying steps to maximize value sls management llc issues letter to abercrombie  fitch co identifying steps to maximize value for shareholders news provided by sls management llc jul    et share this article new york july   prnewswire  sls management llc today sent a letter to the board of directors of abercrombie  fitch co in the letter sls outlines actionable steps for the board of directors to undertake to maximize value for the shareholders the full text of the letter from sls management llc follows july   board of directorsabercrombie  fitch co fitch pathnew albany oh  to the board of directors of abercrombie  fitch co as you are aware we have been a longterm investor in abercrombie  fitch co abercrombie or the company despite mr martinezs assurance in the companys press release on july   that the company is taking aggressive action we do not believe the board has been or is currently being aggressive enough with an expected average cash position of nearly m other assets worth as much as m and a market capitalization down to around m we believe that there is substantial opportunity for the board and management team to reverse years of underperformance and create significant shareholder value we sent a letter to the board on april   suggesting an aggressive plan of action to enhance shareholder value we did not hear back we subsequently spoke to the ceo and coo on june   and recommended that the company contemplate outlining a clear plan b for value creation as a standalone company should merger discussions terminate we were told that no such parallel effort was being sought this was confirmed on july   with a failed sales process and no aggressive announcement regarding actionable plans to create shareholder value this resulted in abercrombies stock being down  and trading over  of its float in a single day the stock has continued to trade lower  management continues to promise a better second half and according to press reports the board turned down offers which were around  per share or around  higher than where the stock is today to us this suggests a deep internal confidence in abercrombie given these factors the ample cash cushion and substantial noncore assets you should therefore be aggressively buying back stock and reducing the share count at these levels yet there is no substantial sharereducing buyback  capital allocation whether it involves investing in existing operations making acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks is a paramount responsibility of every ceo and board  william thorndike in the acclaimed book the outsiders describes the value creation decisions of henry singleton the former ceo of teledyne who pioneered alternating between dividends and large tenders depending on the lifecycle and valuation of the company  according to thorndike singleton believed buying stock at attractive prices was selfcatalyzing analogous to coiling a spring that at some future point would surge forward to realize full value generating exceptional returns in the process we welcome abercrombies commitment to shareholder returns however there is a time in every companys life for buybacks and a time for dividends with the stock trading at current valuations and a margin of safety from the value of noncore assets this is the time for buybacks we highly recommend a change to abercrombies capital allocation strategy that will drive a significant increase in shareholder value we are outlining two options option a is a large onetime buyback in conjunction with a reduction in your dividend option b is a monetization of assets comprising a substantial portion of abercrombies current valuation that wall street analysts and investors are giving you no credit for  option a initiate a dutch tender to buy back m of abercrombie stock at current prices this represents over  of shares outstanding  reduce the dividend to  per year or around a  dividend yield with the dividend yield approaching  it is clear that investors do not own abercrombie for its stable yield indeed market participants are likely indicating that they expect the dividend to be cut while we believe that abercrombies dividend is sustainable given managements capital expenditure budget which is well below depreciation expense and normalization of workingcapital outflows in fiscal  this is a unique time to switch strategies and be a material buyer of your stock a repurchase of almost  of abercrombies shares would be an important illustration of managements confidence in the turnaround and the attractiveness of the stock at current prices the cash used would be returned in just over  years through the reduction of your dividend which saves m per year we fully recognize that retail is suffering especially at malls due to a number of factors including an overstored position that exceeds demand and the competitive threat of ecommerce this dutch tender would leave the company with a pro forma cash balance of m given seasonal working capital swings and the substantial reduction in your cash outlays for the dividend we would expect abercrombie to be at the boards target cash balances within one year our confidence is augmented by the fact that even in poor operating years such as fiscal  and  free cash flow would easily cover the new m dividend and start growing your cash balance indeed management has guided to improving trends as we move through  given this and the margin of safety from your noncore assets we believe that abercrombie has a unique opportunity to acquire a substantial amount of its shares at discounted levels without adding meaningful pressure to operations leverage or cash flow option b as an alternative to the tender and dividend reduction detailed above the company could maintain the dividend and its cash buffer and monetize abercrombies noncore assets and use the proceeds to repurchase shares the company has a substantial set of assets on its balance sheet that we believe are worth m to m or  of the companys enterprise value at current prices these noncore assets include i home campus  distribution centers and ii the overfunded rabbi trust  abercrombie owns its k square foot home campus on  acres in new albany ohio based on colliers data on recent comparable office transactions in columbus we believe the headquarters and land are worth m if the company executed a saleleaseback or mortgaged the property  a m valuation for the headquarters and land with a  ltv mortgage at  would only add m of interest expense but would enable the company to buy back  of shares outstanding abercrombie could also enter into a saleleaseback on its two one million square foot stateoftheart distribution centers built for m we estimate this would lead to m of proceeds and enable the company to buy back an additional  of shares outstanding with additional rent of only m per year put simply these two actions would monetize m of noncore assets worth  of abercrombies current enterprise value and add m or less than  to your operating expense base of bn we recognize that the board may take comfort in its safetynet of noncore assets however with the stock trading at levels not seen in  years and at a valuation of x consensus ebitda the value of these noncore assets now comprise a significant portion of the companys enterprise value regardless of which of the above options the board decides to pursue we believe the company should work to unwind the overfunded rabbi trust which sits in other assets on the balance sheet and is a legacy of the jefferies era based on our conversations with management the trust is m overfunded and could be unwound providing an additional source of liquidity for the company lets hypothetically illustrate how significant the opportunities on balance sheet are if you were to execute option a option b and liquidate the rabbi trust the company could buy back roughly  of its shares and save m per year m cost of option a and b and m savings from dividend reduction we have proposed two actionable plans either of these two options should be enacted immediately if you are right and the back half of the year is a turning point a significant value enhancing opportunity will disappear we look forward to discussing these important matters very truly yours scott swid view original
