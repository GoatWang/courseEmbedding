meltdown george hall’s latest comeback strategy has hit hard times with one fund down  percent over the past  months by michelle celarier george hall founder and chief executive officer of clinton group inc photo credit chris kleponisbloomberg news hedge fund pioneer george hall appears to be on one of his nine lives his firm clinton group survived regulatory probes in  and a mortgagebacked securities meltdown in  but now a quantitative fund it manages looks to be one of the first such funds to suffer a big drawdown this year at a time when many oncehot quants have had lackluster returns at best in recent years clinton has developed a wellregarded quant strategy which breathed new life into the longbeleaguered firm but its europeandomiciled stat arb fund which is a ucits undertakings for collective investment in transferrable securities a type of mutual fund for european investors is down to about  million after performance losses of  percent over the past  months according to a deutsche asset management report that contrasts with a high of about  million in gross assets at yearend according to the firms latest securities and exchange commission filings the ucits strategy is similar to clinton groups equity strategies hedge fund which had  million at yearend making it the firms largest fund it too has also suffered sizeable performance losses clinton group declined to comment for this story last year clinton groups assets  which once stood at more than  billion  had reached their highest level in a decade as the firm sought to come back from an earlier valuation scandal and problems associated with the financial crisis at the end of  it reported  billion in regulatory assets under management though that number also includes leverage the recent decline is a combination of redemptions and performance losses investors say a big chunk of these redemptions occurred in may when the ucits fund lost more than  percent bringing its year to date loss to  percent according to the deutsche report last year it lost  percent its only winning year was in  when it was launched the ucits fund was launched in may of  and gained  percent that year most of its holdings are european stocks its unclear how much leverage compounded the woes but the ucits gross leverage was not expected to exceed  percent of the value of the fund according to deutsche bank while the us quant funds composition is similar to the ucits investors cant sell their shares as easily as in the ucits which has daily liquidity the us quant fund which has been around much longer has produced annualized returns of  percent since inception in  according to the deutsche report still that is down from about  percent last september even before the latest troubles clinton was a shadow of its former self hall was one of the more flamboyant figures in the hedge fund world more than a decade ago he even merited a mention in a  new york magazine story about hedge funds that wrote about his foot yacht anchored for a time in chelsea piers clinton which opened its doors in  was once one of the biggest hedge fund firms in the business focusing on convertible bonds and mortgagebacked securities by  it was running about  billion then an exemployee sued the firm charging it with mismarking its assetbacked securities both the commodities and futures trading commission and the securities and exchange commission investigated but declined to bring any action against clinton but assets fell to about  billion despite the clean bill of health  in early  clintons assets fell to a new low of  million after its multistrategy fund fell  percent due to bad bets on mortgagebacked securities according to a bloomberg report total assets in that fund declined by almost  percent due to redemptions since the financial crisis clinton fashioned a comeback with its move into quants a strategy run by yong lu a physics phd who joined clinton as senior portfolio manager in  from citadel separately in june the yearold hall put his manhattan townhouse on the market asking  million for his  east th street pad according to city records reported by real estate website luxury living nyc he

the family by matthew goldstein and steve edermarch   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo marc mezvinsky right with his fatherinlaw former president bill clinton and the nba star dikembe mutombo in february credit elsagetty images since marrying chelsea clinton five years ago marc mezvinsky a money manager appears to have settled into his life as bill and hillary clinton’s soninlaw he has regularly appeared at charitable events once introducing the former president at the clinton foundation’s celebrity poker tournament by dryly saying “you may have heard of my fatherinlaw” and at the recent nba allstar game mr mezvinsky took a seat next to mr clinton and his partner in charitable endeavors dikembe mutombo the former basketball starbeyond the glamour being part of the clinton family has provided mr mezvinsky with another perk access to wealthy investors with ties to the clintonswhen mr mezvinsky and his partners began raising money in  for a new hedge fund firm eaglevale partners a number of investors in the firm were longtime supporters of the clintons according to interviews and financial documents reviewed by the new york times tens of millions of dollars raised by eaglevale can be attributed to investors with some relationship or link to the clintonsthe investors include hedge fund managers like marc lasry and james leitner an overseas money management firm connected to the rothschild family and people from goldman sachs including the chief executive lloyd c blankfein some of the investors in eaglevale have contributed campaign money to the former president and mrs clinton who is widely expected to run for president again in  some have also contributed to the family’s foundation advertisement continue reading the main story identifying who put money into eaglevale a roughly  million fund that has had underwhelming returns for much of its brief history is difficult because hedge funds do not publicly disclose their investors still the overlap between at least some of eaglevale’s investors and backers of the clintons illustrates how politics and finance can intersect and shows the fine line the clinton family must navigate as their charitable and business endeavors come under scrutiny in an election cycle continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story a person briefed on the matter and close to the firm said the amount of investor money recruited by mr mezvinsky is not large amounting to less than  percent of the firm’s total outside capital clinton supporters also say there are more direct ways to cultivate favor with the family such as giving to the foundation where chelsea clinton is vice chairwoman than by investing with a hedge fund that her husband cofoundedthere are several examples of eaglevale investors with relationships with the clintons rock creek group a washingtonbased investment advisory firm placed  million from the california public employees’ retirement system and another public pension fund with eaglevale in late  and early  rock creek’s chairwoman afsaneh beschloss attended state dinners at the clinton white house in the late s and was a panelist in the annual meeting of the clinton global initiative in september in new york her husband michael is a wellknown presidential historian and occasional writer for the timesfor a brief period in  after eaglevale had been up and running for about a year rock creek sublet temporary office space to mrs clinton after she stepped down as secretary of statemr lasry a cofounder of
