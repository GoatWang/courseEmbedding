advisory board career opportunities   about the opko renal division the renal division of opko health inc is developing proprietary products to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism shpt associated with chronic kidney disease ckd and vitamin d insufficiency these products are designed to treat patients with stage   or  ckd but they also have potential application to other indications including metabolic bone disease such as renal osteodystrophy and osteoporosis in addition the renal division is developing novel therapies to treat elevated blood phosphorus levels hyperphosphatemia in order to improve the control of shpt in ckd patients ckd is a worldwide public health problem with steadily increasing incidence prevalence and cost key factors driving growth of the ckd market in developed countries include aging populations and the current epidemic of obesity and its associated complications of hypertension and adultonset diabetes nearly  of ckd cases have etiologies linked to hypertension and diabetes the worldwide incidence of adultonset diabetes alone is expected to double by  to approximately  million ckd is categorized into  successive stages each stage representing more advanced disease the earliest stages of ckd afflict nearly  million individuals in the united states us and contribute to the widespread development of osteoporosis by the time a patient reaches stage  ckd the kidney is virtually nonfunctional the majority of stage  patients require regular dialysis for survival with a small proportion eventually receiving viable kidney transplants in the us the annual cost of treating patients with stage  ckd is approximately  billion despite this expenditure ckd continues to be associated with poor outcomes reflecting the inadequacies of the current standard of care vitamin d insufficiency hyperphosphatemia and shpt when inadequately treated are major contributors to poor ckd outcomes opko’s expertise in vitamin d chemistry biochemistry metabolism and physiology combined with its experience in successfully bringing vitamin d therapeutics to market uniquely positions the renal division to improve the lives of ckd patients

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
