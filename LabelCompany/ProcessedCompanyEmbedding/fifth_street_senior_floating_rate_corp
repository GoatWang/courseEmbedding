provide an overview of our results and steve will summarize the financials i will now turn the call over to bernie bernard berman thank you robyn before turning to our quarterly results i would like to briefly discuss the leadership transition that occurred last month on april   i was appointed as ceo of fsfr following the resignation of patrick dalton as you may know ive been a partner at fifth street’s external advisor for over  years and have served as chairman of fsfr’s board of directors since  the leadership transition has been a smooth one and i am excited to lead fsfr as it continues to execute on its strategy to enhance shareholder value for the quarter ended march   fsfr generated  of net investment income per share slightly below our quarterly dividend of  per share net investment income per share was impacted by a onetime interest charge of  related to the downsizing of our citibank credit facility as well as lower revenue due to the timing of our investment activity despite the one time interest charge in this quarter related to downsizing the citibank facility we anticipate that we will save approximately  annually in unused fees through the reinvestment period on a positive note the march quarter was marked by credit stability and an increase in leverage back within our target range turning to our portfolio fsfr continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of senior secured floating rate loans as of march   our portfolio consisted of senior secured floating rate loans spread across  companies in  industries with our largest investment excluding our investment in our joint venture accounting for  of total assets as we outlined in prior calls we have been working diligently to exit restructure or improve underlying business performance at our stressed investments and maximize recoveries for our shareholders to that end during the march quarter we exited our legacy investment answerscom a credit that had been a nonaccrual although we subsequently committed to and retain a small portion of the dip facility that is on accrual status at this time we have only one investment on pik nonaccrual which represents  of total net investments at fair value or  at cost net asset value was relatively stable quarter over quarter decreasing  from the prior quarter to  nav was primarily impacted by under earning our dividend by  and was characterized by stable credit performance in our portfolio of companies turning to the broader middle market we believe this environment continues to be challenging despite a rebound in volumes from the fourth quarter an increasing demand for new market entrants and private credit funds has led to an increase in refinancings which has resulted in significant spread tightening as a result of this environment we have selectively invested in credits that meet our risk adjusted return parameters closing  million of investments during the march quarter another broader theme in the middle market has been the continued increase in libor with  of fsfrs debt portfolio in floating rate loans we believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit in a rising interest rate environment as of march   of the total debt portfolio had a libor floor of  since three month libor is currently at around  libor floors of  have been exceeded and going forward fsfr should experience improving net interest margins which should result in a benefit to earnings this benefit should increase as three month libor continues to rise since over  of our capital structure is comprised of equity turning to our balance sheet we are pleased to have increased the utilization of our liabilities and operated within our target range of  to  times debt to equity ending the quarter at  leverage as a reminder in

of ge capitals sponsor business as evidenced by the sale of ge capitals sponsor finance business to the canada pension plan investment board the landscape surrounding middle market leveraged lending continues to change due to regulatory headwinds we see a continued disintermediation of leveraged lending from the traditional banking sector characterized by declining bank participation in middle market leveraged lending while participation from nonbank lenders has increased yearoveryear we believe that borrowers and sponsors favor a collaborative partnership approach which nonbank lenders are typically able to provide through more flexible financing solutions large hold sizes and diversified product offerings the nonbank lending space has become more institutionalized gaining market share and influence for example during the second quarter through midjune nonbank lenders captured  of left lead mandates that lcd has tracked by volume and  by number of loans up from  and  respectively in the first quarter middle market supply and demand imbalance persists on the macro front an overall supplydemand imbalance continues to define the middle market as the ongoing disintermedmiation of leveraged lending from the traditional banking sector intensifies us syndicated loan issuance increased quarteroverquarter mainly driven by refinancings but when compared to the previous year volume for the second quarter lagged behind last years totals in line with the quarteroverquarter increase in volume since the first quarter we have witnessed an increase in deal flow from select industry verticals such as healthcare which is exhibiting relatively lower leverage and wider spreads as compared to other traditional sectors we believe this dynamic exists due to lenders shying away from the complex reimbursement environment which characterizes these credits fifth streets established origination platform allows us to uncover such pockets of opportunity our size scale and ability to allocate across our platform positions us to maintain a steady flow of high quality loans focused on capital preservation as a leading middle market sponsorbacked lending platform fifth street seeks to provide sponsors with both balance sheet flexibility and hightouch valueadded services we focus on capital preservation and maintain strict underwriting standards when deploying capital into new loans we feel confident in fsc and fsfrs conservative positioning as we have continued to focus on senior secured instruments since we believe the current riskreward tradeoff is strongest in first lien and onestop transactions fsc opportunistically invests in second lien and mezzanine transactions when there are strong riskadjusted return opportunities additionally as we continue to position the portfolios of both fsc and fsfr we have limited our exposure to cyclical industries including energy consumerdriven businesses and companies with direct retail exposure as the economy continues to grow we are positioning our investment vehicles for potential interest rate increases we believe fsc with  floating rate assets and fsfr as a pure play  floating rate vehicle are wellpositioned for potential interest rate rises we are seeing continued pressure on libor floors with select deals decreasing libor floors from  basis points to  basis points or  basis points generally speaking completing new deals with libor floors below  basis points should slightly decrease the negative impact of rising interest rates up to  basis points after libor rises more than  basis points both fsc and fsfr should generate additional income and benefit from a rising interest rate environment refocusing fsc on core middle market lending businesses as previously announced fsc sold its portfolio company healthcare finance group llc hfg to midcap financial hfg is a specialty lender providing assetbacked lending and term loan products to various segments of the healthcare industry fsc acquired hfg in june of  and together with management expanded the companys suite of products and capabilities positioning it for future growth upon the sale of hfg fsc generated approximately an  net return on its total investment during fscs recent strategic review management decided that it was important to refocus fsc on its core lending businesses including middle market sponsorbacked lending aircraft and technology venture this decision was made because we believe that the middle market provides relatively strong opportunities and investing in its core lending businesses should allow fsc to generate higher riskadjusted returns prospective management fee reduction at fsc finalized fsc has entered into a waiver with its investment adviser a subsidiary of fifth street asset management inc nasdaqfsam fsam in which fscs investment adviser has agreed to waive  of fscs base management fee for increases in capital related to the issuance of new equity fscs current base management fee is  of fscs gross assets excluding cash but going forward the fee related to the new equity raised will be  this waiver is effective until january   and it is the intention of fsam to renew the waiver on an annual basis going forward the reduction in base management fee will benefit all shareholders equally regardless of when they invested and was implemented to create additional operating leverage allowing our shareholders to benefit from economies of scale as fsc grows fsfr has successfully optimized its capital structure during the first half of  we worked hard to strengthen fsfrs capital structure closing on three different financing facilities in order to position it for improved profitability and future growth fsfr was able to capitalize on an attractive capital markets environment to optimize its capital structure and lock in lowcost longterm financing in january fsfr closed on a  million credit facility provided by citibank which provided fsfr with the necessary leverage to reach its target leverage range of x to x debttoequity then in june fsfr closed a  million debt securitization transaction in which it issued  million of longterm secured notes to refinance its existing  million credit facility arranged by natixis new york branch the third financing was completed in connection with fsfr glick jv llc fsfr glick jv in which the joint venture entered into a  million credit facility with credit suisse ag cayman islands branch providing the ability to lever up to two times debttoequity by improving fsfrs capital structure management believes that fsfr is wellpositioned to continue investing in senior secured floating rate loans and take advantage of positive business trends strategic partnerships continue to expand we continue to make significant progress in both funding and expanding our joint ventures at fsc and fsfr the ability to attract experienced institutional investors as partners is a vote of confidence in fifth streets origination platform underwriting and portfolio management expertise as of june   fsfr glick jv the joint venture between fsfr and entities controlled by members of the glick family was approximately  ramped out of the total anticipated investment capacity of  million consistent with our initial projections we expect the joint venture to provide fsfr with a lowteens weighted average annualized return on investment when fully ramped subsequent to the june quarter senior loan fund jv i llc slf jv i the joint venture between fsc and a subsidiary of the kemper corporation closed on  million of additional leverage sourced from credit suisse ag cayman islands branch this additional leverage for slf jv i should allow the joint venture to expand up to its anticipated investment capacity of  million we continue to have discussions with third parties about additional partnerships as we have ample capacity to grow these and other similar joint ventures the joint ventures expand each bdcs investment capacity to underwrite senior secured middle market loans and provide an efficient way to finance assets that enhance returns for our shareholders we look forward to discussing our june quarterly
