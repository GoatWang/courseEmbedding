events take action donate interview with chris policinski president and ceo of land o’lakes inc as the chairman of the usglc’s business advisory council how do you explain to your fellow ceos the importance of the international affairs budget and funding for development and diplomacy the world is getting to be a smaller place every day and from an economic perspective what happens in one country has ripple effects throughout the world  funding from the international affairs budget which is just  percent of the federal budget helps to strengthen the economies of developing nations around the world  whether it’s supporting farmers to grow crops helping to build better roads so goods can be driven to markets or teaching children in order to build a more educated workforce all of these things add to the economic wellbeing of a country which in turn means new markets are available for american goods on the agricultural front land o’lakes is a fortune  company that does much more than produce cheese and butter  we’re one of the largest crop input and animal nutrition companies in the country so the opportunity to market our products and services overseas has tremendous revenue potential for land o’lakes what first interested you in being involved with the usglc the usglc is extremely effective in what they do and their supporters and members are a “who’s who” of america’s business and foreign policy leaders  individuals like colin powell madeleine albright and many prominent individuals here in minnesota have all spoken about how important the usglc’s message of smart power engagement is to our country businesses like caterpillar lockheed martin and procter  gamble as well as prominent nonprofit organizations and faithbased groups like care save the children and world vision have all come together under the usglc umbrella with a commitment to ensure the us has a robust international affairs budget  this speaks volumes when we visit capitol hill  when a member of congress sees the commitment of a major company or a respected charity on the same issue they take notice  that’s why the usglc is so effective and land o’lakes is proud to be a part of it what are some of the specific things land o’lakes does to make a difference in global development in my view feeding a hungry world is both an obligation and an opportunity  for nearly three decades land o’lakes has worked to alleviate the effects of hunger around the world through the efforts of our international development division  we work with the us department of agriculture the us agency for international development and other partners in the federal government to implement agriculture development programs around the world in fact since the early s we’ve implemented more than  development projects in  countries we’ve also been involved in global school nutrition programs since  in nine different nations  our programs help provide fresh milk dairy products and other agricultural support projects for people in desperate need of nutrition    and an income food security has been in the news a lot lately  what is your take on some solutions from a us development perspective since land o’lakes has worked globally fighting hunger for the past  years we have a unique vantage point on the issue of food security i believe one of america’s greatest yet least acknowledged success stories is our increase in agricultural productivity over the past century  and how have we done this  it’s through better farming techniques and technology both of which we need to share with the rest of the world through our efforts to alleviate global hunger using advanced technologies for global food production however can be a divisive topic for governments  to protect the ability of producers to use safe proven technologies those of us involved in any aspect of agriculture must work to educate the public and policymakers about our industry i am glad to see the us government making food security a major issue  land o’lakes is already doing tremendous work in agricultural development around the world thanks to the us international affairs budget and we look forward to providing advice and assisting in us efforts to further alleviate global hunger many american businesses may wonder what possible benefit the usglc would have for them  how would you answer that question the work of the usglc benefits american business in many ways it’s important to understand that us foreign assistance programs help stabilize markets in struggling and emerging economies around the world  good governance allows businesses to thrive and create opportunity in the private sector  providing clean water for communities improves health outcomes and allows for increased productivity because people are sick less often from waterborne diseases  educating young people is key to creating a stable qualified workforce for industry and commerce  these are just a few of the ways a robust international affairs budget helps american businesses succeed in the global marketplace at land o’lakes many programs in our international development division are funded through the
