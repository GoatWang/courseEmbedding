that have the greatest impact on portfolio returns and placing that responsibility in the hands of investment professionals traditional plans require each plan participant to essentially act as the portfolio manager of their k plan assets in other words the choice of whether to buy emerging market bonds or large cap value stocks are managed by participants typically though few of them have the time to effectively keep up with market fluctuations on an ongoing basis the main management k places critical asset allocation decisions into the hands of an experienced three person investment committee they actively manages four dynamic etf risk based portfolios which provide solutions for participants from their s until well into their retirement years as such main management becomes an

llc basics  nolocom grow your legal practice meet the editors sign in support search search type all products lawyers articles search term location legal topics business formation llcs  corporations llcs limited liability companies llc basics limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a limited liability company llc offers protection from personal liability for business debts just like a corporation however unlike a corporation which must pay its own taxes an llc is a passthrough tax entity the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship moreover while setting up an llc is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship running one is significantly easier than running a corporation here are the main features of an llc limited personal liability like shareholders of a corporation all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor  such as a supplier a lender or a landlord  the creditor cannot legally come after an llc members house car or other personal possessions because only llc assets are used to pay off business debts llc owners stand to lose only the money that theyve invested in the llc this feature is often called limited liability exceptions to limited liability while llc owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions this protection is not absolute this drawback is not unique to llcs however  the same exceptions apply to corporations an llc owner can be held personally liable if he or she personally and directly injures someone personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the llc defaults fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees wages intentionally does something fraudulent illegal or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else or treats the llc as an extension of his or her personal affairs rather than as a separate legal entity this last exception is the most important if owners dont treat the llc as a separate business a court might decide that the llc doesnt really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts to keep this from happening make sure you and your coowners act fairly and legally do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors creditors or other outsiders fund your llc adequately invest enough cash in the business so that your llc can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities keep llc and personal business separate get a federal employer identification number open up a businessonly checking account and keep your personal finances out of your llc accounting books create an operating agreement having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your llcs separate existence for more on this see nolos article the llc operating agreement for more information on llc limited liability protection and the differences in state laws see  llcs and limited  liability  what protection do you get   additional protection business insurance a good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not for instance if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a clients back your liability insurance policy should cover you insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court in addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations insurance can protect the llcs assets from lawsuits and claims but your llc wont be protected if it doesnt pay its bills commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts whether or not theyre personally guaranteed for more information on insurance see nolos article obtaining small business insurance llc taxes unlike a corporation an llc is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes instead it is what the irs calls a passthrough entity like a partnership or sole proprietorship this means that business income passes through the business to the llc members who report their share of profits  or losses  on their individual income tax returns each llc member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs while an llc itself doesnt pay taxes coowned llcs must file form  an informational return with the irs each year this form which partnerships also have to file sets out each llc members share of the llcs profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure llc members are correctly reporting their income for more information on llc taxes see nolos article how llcs are taxed llc management the owners of most small llcs participate equally in the management of their business this arrangement is called member management there is an alternative management structure  somewhat awkwardly called manager management  in which you designate one or more owners or even an outsider to take responsibility for managing the llc the nonmanaging owners sometimes family members who have invested in the company simply sit back and share in llc profits in a managermanaged llc only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the llc choosing manager management sometimes makes sense but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities for more information see nolos limited liability company llc faq forming an llc to create an llc you file articles of organization in some states called a certificate of organization or certificate of formation with the llc division of your state government this office is often in the same department as the corporations division which is usually part of the secretary of states office filing fees range from about  to  now in every state you can  form an llc with just one person many states supply a blank onepage form for the articles of organization on which you need only specify a few basic details about your llc such as its name and address and contact information for a person involved with the llc usually called a registered agent who will receive legal papers on its behalf some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the llc members in addition to filing articles of organization you must create a written llc operating agreement you dont have to file your operating agreement with the state but that doesnt mean you can get by without one the operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the llc members rights and responsibilities their percentage interests in the business and their share of the profits to learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an llc read nolos article how to form an llc to form your llc right now use nolos online llc which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state ending an llc under the laws of many states unless your operating agreement says otherwise when one member wants to leave the llc the company dissolves in that case the llc members must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts divide any assets and profits among themselves and then decide whether they want to start a new llc to continue the business with the remaining members your llc operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including buysell or buyout provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the llc to pursue other interests for more information see nolos article plan ahead for llc ownership changes share on google plus

plans k the main k solution offers a significant upgrade to the traditional defined contribution plan it offers participants many advantages not available in traditional doityourself k plans the key differentiator is relieving employees of the burden of the asset allocation decisions that have the greatest impact on portfolio returns and placing that responsibility in the hands of investment professionals traditional plans require each plan participant to essentially act as the portfolio manager of their k plan assets in other words the choice of whether to buy emerging market bonds or large cap value stocks are managed by participants typically though few of them have the time to effectively keep up with market fluctuations on an ongoing basis the main management k places critical asset allocation decisions into the hands of an experienced three person investment committee they actively manages four dynamic etf risk based portfolios which provide solutions for participants from their s until well into their retirement years as such main management becomes an investment fiduciary to the plan thus relieving the plan sponsor of this duty to learn more about main management may improve the retirement benefits of a k plan and dramatically reduce the personal liability of plan fiduciaries please call us   market notes get our latest market notes get in touch send messageleave
