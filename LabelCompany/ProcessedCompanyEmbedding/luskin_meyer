public resource and agent for social mobility has donated  million to the campus the second largest gift ever received the gift from meyer luskin and his wife renee will go toward academic programs and capital improvements that bolster ucla’s efforts to harness intellectual capital engage the public and serve as a resource in addressing leading civic and societal challenges particularly in the los angeles region it will be equally divided between the ucla school of public affairs – the campus home for scholarship and teaching in public policy urban planning and social welfare – and a planned residential conference center that promises to expand dialogue between scholars government and business leaders and the public at large chancellor gene block who has made civic engagement and community service top campus priorities said the gift “reflects both our strength as a public asset and our optimism for the future” “i am humbled and inspired by the extraordinary generosity of meyer and renee luskin” block said “the luskins are helping to ensure ucla’s continued leadership as a public university dedicated to developing new knowledge and helping to address both today’s and tomorrow’s most pressing policy and scientific challenges” meyer luskin commuted to ucla from boyle heights earning a bachelor’s degree in economics in  and went on to run a diversified company that is now exclusively an animalfeed product manufacturer “i live and work in the region and wanted to give back in a creative and unique way that helps ucla to continue its important work with the broader community” luskin said “in addition to educating students providing them a way to improve their lives and conducting research ucla should apply faculty expertise to help address our society’s biggest issues and i am appreciative of being able to contribute to those ends” in recognition of the gift both the school and the residential conference center which share interconnected goals will be named after the luskins a naming ceremony for the school of public affairs is scheduled for march  “the luskins’ gift allows us to develop a truly contemporary learning environment for the next generation of public leaders and decisionmakers many of whom choose to devote their professional lives to improving southern california” said franklin d gilliam jr dean of the school of public affairs “the luskins’ generosity will enable us to expand a regional and national debate on some of the most challenging questions of our time how do we design modern cities that are livable and sustainable how do we assimilate immigrants while securing our borders how do we move toward a more just and equitable society” gilliam said the vast majority of the  million flowing to the school will be used to establish endowments to strengthen its academic base support emerging research areas and attract the best talent to both the faculty and student body he said priority areas include graduate student fellowships faculty professorships and new programs in urban studies and social justice – all critical to ensuring continued competitiveness with other leading government and public affairs schools gilliam noted that the school houses the luskin center for innovation established with support from the luskins in  the center works closely with elected officials and nonprofit business and community leaders to develop solutions to important policy challenges “the luskins’ philanthropic priorities are a natural fit with what we do” gilliam said the other half of the luskins’  million gift will support a new residential conference facility that will include  square feet of meeting and conference space at least  guest rooms and a new faculty club it will be built on the site of the existing faculty center a yearold structure in need of costly repairs the existing faculty center has served the campus well but no longer meets contemporary requirements for conferences and symposia said executive vice chancellor and provost scott waugh “our students and faculty and the community at large deserve a firstclass conference facility befitting ucla’s stature as a top public research university” waugh said “hosting scholars from around the world and engaging with the community to address leading problems require modern facilities and overnight accommodations for participants” waugh said the conference facility and new faculty club are important tools in attracting and retaining top researchers no state funding will be involved in construction tentatively scheduled to begin in the spring of  pending approval by the university of california board of regents waugh said a portion of the conference center gift –  million – will be set aside in an endowment to fund

jul    cent reportedly just sold his stake in effen vodka for  millionon jul   quincy jones is suing michael jacksons estate for  millionon jul   one of the best parts about living in los angeles is that this city is full of inspirational people who made mind boggling fortunes off something totally random and unique sure weve got lots of wealthy actors producers and directors but there are also thousands of extremely rich people in la who made fortunes thanks to some absolutely random invention business or product when i need a jolt of inspiration i jump in the car and drive a few minutes away to gaze at  –  million mansions recently while driving through one of these billionaire neighborhoods i happened upon one of the most incredible houses id ever seen it was stunning imagine an allglass palace high up on a hilltop with an infinity pool that overlooks all of la the house was so amazing that i marked the address on my phone and rushed home to research the everything i could find about the owner meyer luskin what i discovered about how mr luskin made his fortune absolutely blew my mind hopefully the story of how meyer luskin became a billionaire thanks to discarded bakery garbage will amaze and inspire you as well…this photo doesnt do it justice but here is meyer luskins incredible house from abovemeyer luskins housejust like lynsi torres the  year old owner of innout burger meyer luskin is an under the radar billionaire you wont see meyer in forbes magazine or on tv bragging about his wealth in fact the only time meyer has ever really spoken publicly was in  after he donated  million to his alma mater ucla luskins gift was one of the largest private donations a university has ever received in return ucla established the meyer and renee luskin school of public affairs and the luskin center for innovation the school also plans to name their newest residence hallconference center after the generous couple giving to ucla was especially important to meyer for three reasons  as a student in the s meyer wouldnt have been able to afford the tuition without a  dollar academic scholarship  he met his wife of more than  years renee while attending ucla and  in his own words the multidisciplinary education i received at ucla has helped me immeasurably in business whether its organizational management or philosophical issues and i am eternally grateful ok so weve established that meyer luskin is a really good guy who loves ucla howd he get so richmeyer and renee luskin meyer luskin is the  year old owner of los angelesbased scope industries scope industries is the largest recycler of expired bakery and grain based byproducts in the united states what does that mean lets say you own a bakery if you dont sell your bread bagels pastries etc within a very specific time frame they legally have to be discarded you cant even donate slightly stale bread to a homeless shelter for health and sanitation reasons the problem is even mom and pop bakeries tend to produce a fairly large amount of waste that cant just be tossed in a regular trash can discard industrial quantities of bakery byproducts is very expensive so what do they do thats where scope comes in scope designs and builds industrial waste compactors that are custom installed at the business after installing the compactors scope then removes the waste several times per weekexpired pastry recyclingat this point alone scope has carved out a nice little installation and recycling business for itself but they are just getting started not only do pay them to haul away your garbage brilliantly scope then sells it all to a third party at a huge premium after scope removes the expired food their trucks bring the it to one of  nationwide processing plants the stale bagels bread tortillas pizza pasta crackers chips and pastries are ground dried and baked into dried bakery product farmers around the world pay top dollar for scopes dried bakery product to feed their cows horses and chickensbut how much money can you make selling cow food scope industries is a private company owned  by meyer luskin and has annual revenues of over  million essentially scope gets paid to convert someone elses trash into gold and the best part is their end consumer cows chickens horses have a never ending appetite and extremely low taste standards its a brilliant business model meyer luskins story is truly amazing and inspirational hopefully it will inspire you to go out an make a fortune off some random endeavor like selling bakery garbage to every farmer in the world for a billion dollarsmeyer luskin interview share on facebook brian warnerprior to launching celebrity net worth brian spent seven years as the managing editor of one of the largest entertainment

initiative has grown from its original focus on complete streets about us  about meyer luskin about meyer luskin “sustaining the environment is the greatest inheritance one can leave to children and the most enduring gift to community and nation” meyer luskinmeyer luskin is no stranger to breaking down barriers and building bridges his experience as a ucla student and lifelong angeleno served as inspiration for establishing a world class research center one that would create a new model of problem solving by uniting the intellectual capital of ucla with forwardlooking civic leaders to address the most pressing issues confronting our community nation and world i live and work in the community and wanted to give back in a creative way that had not been done before says mr luskin as a ucla undergraduate luskin was not a traditional student  he was a student athlete—on the boxing team —who commuted to campus often with five other students from the working class community of boyle heights  after beginning his studies at ucla he left to serve in world war ii  despite the barriers luskin persevered eager to return to ucla to complete his degree in economics  the education was wonderful and the stimulation was great states luskin  in particular luskin valued the interdisciplinary education that he received while not every economics major also has a strong background in history and philosophy luskin found these subjects not only fascinating but ultimately influential in his career as a businessman  in particular luskin credits the philosophy of inductive logic and probability for helping him problem solve think rationally about business decisions and to know what can and cannot be controlled  this philosophy has also helped him to remain notably humble and grateful for all he has achieved  according to luskin persistence is important but there is also an element of luck to success in business  one has to be thankful that situations beyond ones control work out ultimately success is doing something that you enjoy doing as the longtime president and ceo of scope industries luskin values and exemplifies environmental sustainability  his company which converts food waste products into animal food certainly embodies the slogan reduce reuse and recycle  yet luskin also realizes that no one company has so much knowledge in so many disciplines as is needed to comprehensively address complex issues like environmental sustainability  he and his wife renee thought of ucla as a place uniquely able to harness knowledge across fields  new knowledge and solutions have to come from a comprehensive viewpoint and at ucla there is such great brain power across a wide variety of fields renee and meyer luskin established the ucla luskin center for innovation in  with support from the ucla chancellors office  since then the center has set an ambitious goal to produce crossdiscplinary research that will help los angeles and the rest of the country reach the holy grail of environmental sustainability  this is critical because as luskin notes sustaining the environment is the greatest inheritance one can leave to children and the most enduring gift to community and nation i want the center to make a significant impact on the lives of the people around us  the center is already achieving this and is headed exactly where it should be headed i am very excited about the future of the center printerfriendly version news initiatives publications resources events about us ucla meyer  renee luskin conference center  ucla sustainability
