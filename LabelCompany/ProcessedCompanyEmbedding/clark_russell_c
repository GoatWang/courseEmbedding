clark russell from whowhenwhat book  william clark russell  february  –  november  was an english writer best known for his nautical novels at the age of  russell joined the united kingdoms merchant navy serving for eight years the hardships of life at sea damaged his health permanently but provided him with material for a career as a writer he wrote short stories press articles historical essays biographies and a book of verse but was known best for his novels most of which were about life at sea he maintained a simultaneous career as a journalist principally as a columnist on nautical subjects for the daily telegraph russell campaigned for better conditions for merchant seamen and his work influenced reforms approved by parliament to prevent unscrupulous shipowners from exploiting their crews his influence in this respect was acknowledged by the future king george v among russells contemporary admirers were herman melville and algernon swinburne contents  life and career  early years  writer  campaigner  later years  works  notes and references  sources  external links life and careeredit early yearsedit william clark russell was born in new york in the carlton house hotel broadway one of four sons of the english composer henry russell and his first wife isabella lloyd – he was the halfbrother of the impresario henry russell and the conductor sir landon ronald he was educated at private schools in britain winchester and france boulogne at the latter together with a school friend a son of charles dickens he planned to quit school to travel in africa a letter from dickens dissuaded the boys but russell continued to crave a life of adventure at the age of  russell left school and joined the united kingdoms merchant navy during  he recollected russell as a midshipman my first ship was a wellknown australian liner the duncan dunbar  i went to sea as a midshipman as it is termed though i never could persuade myself that a lad in the merchant service no matter how heavy might be the premium his friends paid for him has a right to a title of grade or rating that belongs essentially and peculiarly to the royal navy i signed for a shilling a month and with the rest of us there were ten was called young gentleman but we were put to work which an able seaman would have been within his rights in refusing as being what is called boys duty i need not be particular enough that the discipline was as rough as though we had been lads in the forecastle with a huge boatswain and brutal boatswains mates to look after us we paid ten guineas each as a contribution to some imagination of a stock of eatables for the midshipmens berth but my memory carries no more than a few tins of preserved potatoes a great number of bottles of pickles and a cask of exceedingly moist sugar therefore we were thrown upon the ships provisions and i very soon became intimately acquainted with the quality and nature of the stores served out to forecastle hands russell travelled to asia and australia off the coast of china during  he witnessed the capture of the taku forts by combined british and french forces later while he was serving on the ship hougomont the third mate went mad and attacked him with a tableknife russell began to write of some of his experiences when he was confined to his quarters for a breach of discipline at the age of  russell quit the merchant servicen  the privations of his eight years as a sailor had gravely damaged his health and he was never completely healthy again for the rest of his life the positive legacy from his service was a wealth of material on which he based a successful career as a novelist writeredit russell had an office job with a commercial company for a few months after which he decided to attempt a literary career his first attempt was a fiveact tragedy fra angelico which was staged unsuccessfully in london during  he began work as a journalist and during the next two decades wrote for a variety of newspapers including the newcastle daily chronicle the kent county news and most importantly for him the daily telegraph for which he wrote articles using the pseudonym seafarer during  he married alexandrina henry with whom he had a son and three daughters from the early s russell published novels using pseudonyms sydney mostyn and eliza rhyl davies with modest success the stories of an old seaman at ramsgate gave him the idea of writing about life at sea using on his own experience an obituarist of russell wrote that since the heyday of such writers as captain marryat michael scott and frederick chamier some thirty or forty years before no one in this country had written of the sea from actual knowledge russell during  russell was at first doubtful if stories of merchant navy life could compete with tales of the royal navy only two writers had dealt with the mercantile side of the ocean life – dana the author of two years before the mast and herman melville both of them it is needless to say americans i could not recollect such a book written by an englishman his first attempt at a novel of merchant navy life was john holdsworth chief mate during  which russell later thought of as reluctant and timid in dealing with sea topics it received kindly reviews but russell regarded his next attempt the wreck of the grosvenor  as his first real sea book russell sold the copyright of the wreck of the grosvenor to the publisher sampson low for £ about £ in  terms during the next four years it sold nearly  copies excellent reviews and good sales helped establish russells writing pattern the scholar john sutherland wrote during  that the wreck of the grosvenor was the most popular midvictorian melodrama of adventure and heroism at sea it remained popular and widely read in illustrated editions well into the first half of the th century it was russells bestselling and bestknown novel russell noted in a preface the novel found its first and best welcome in the united states and commented elsewhere that his work was greeted with more enthusiasm in the united states than in britain the biographer g s woods lists among russells best sea novels the frozen pirate  a sailors sweetheart  an ocean tragedy  the death ship  list ye landsmen  and overdue  according to woods russell wrote a total of  novels additionally he published collections of short stories and newspaper articles a volume of historical essays popular biographies william dampier and admirals nelson and collingwood and a collection of verses algernon swinburne described russell as the greatest master of the sea living or dead herman melville admired russells work and dedicated his book john marr and other sailors  to him russell reciprocated dedicating an ocean tragedy to melville during  despite their mutual regard neither writer influenced the others style and it is melvilles works that have proved the more enduring arthur conan doyle made dr watson an admirer in the five orange pips in which he was deep in one of clark russells fine sea stories while temporarily back in b baker street particularly during later years when arthritis made it difficult for him to hold a pen russell dictated his work to a secretary according to the manchester guardian like most dictated work these books have a rather inflated rhetorical literary manner despite this criticism the paper concluded his books are wellproportioned they are well thought out his characters have all been seen even his ships have character no other sea writer except perhaps melville … has given such patient inventive care to the setting in which his characters move … he saw things so clearly that he could make them real in description … in his best books and in his wonderful short stories he has set down the semblance of sea life and of the changing beauty of the waters as faithfully as such things can be done according to woods his descriptions of storms at sea and atmospheric effects were brilliant pieces of word painting but his characterisation was often indifferent and his plots were apt to become monotonous russells books are a favorite of dr john watson the fictional chronicler of sherlock holmes cases as mentioned in the short story the five orange pips by sir arthur conan doyle campaigneredit woods writes that russells sea novels stimulated public interest in the conditions under which sailors lived and thereby paved the way for the reform of many abuses the year after russells death woods wrote a zealous champion in the press of the grievances of the merchant seamen clark russell urged that the hardships of their life were practically unchanged since the repeal of the navigation acts in  and that despite the merchant shipping act of  ships were still sent to sea undermanned and overladen in response to this agitation further acts of parliament to prevent unseaworthy vessels putting to sea were passed in    and  in  clark russell protested against the seamen and firemen not being represented on the shipping commission which was appointed by mr chamberlain in  the duke of york afterwards king george v expressed his opinion that the great improvement in the conditions of the merchant service was due in no small degree to clark russells writings later russell turned his attention to the deplorable provisions that unscrupulous shipowners provided for merchant seamen on their vessels nothing more atrociously nasty could be found amongst the neglected putrid sweepings of a butchers back premises later yearsedit during his last two decades russell became progressively more disabled by arthritis generally regarded as a legacy of his years at sea as a youth – the sailors enemy as the manchester guardian stated he did not allow this to stop him writing the times commented he worked harder than many haler men he went to health resorts including bath droitwich and madeira and after living in ramsgate and deal on the south

broadway one of four sons of the english composer henry russell and his first wife isabella lloyd – he was the halfbrother of the impresario henry russell and the conductor sir landon ronald he was educated at private schools in britain winchester and france boulogne at the latter together with a school friend a son of charles dickens he planned to quit school to travel in africa a letter from dickens dissuaded the boys but russell continued to crave a life of adventure at the age of  russell left school and joined the united kingdoms merchant navy during  he recollected russell as a midshipman my first ship was a wellknown australian liner the duncan dunbar  i went to sea as a midshipman as it is termed though i never could persuade myself that a lad in the merchant service no matter how heavy might be the premium his friends paid for him has a right to a title of grade or rating that belongs essentially and peculiarly to the royal navy i signed for a shilling a month and with the rest of us there were ten was called young gentleman but we were put to work which an able seaman would have been within his rights in refusing as being what is called boys duty i need not be particular enough that the discipline was as rough as though we had been lads in the forecastle with a huge boatswain and brutal boatswains mates to look after us we paid ten guineas each as a contribution to some imagination of a stock of eatables for the midshipmens berth but my memory carries no more than a few tins of preserved potatoes a great number of bottles of pickles and a cask of exceedingly moist sugar therefore we were thrown upon the ships provisions and i very soon became intimately acquainted with the quality and nature of the stores served out to forecastle hands russell travelled to asia and australia off the coast of china during  he witnessed the capture of the taku forts by combined british and french forces later while he was serving on the ship hougomont the third mate went mad and attacked him with a tableknife russell began to write of some of his experiences when he was confined to his quarters for a breach of discipline at the age of  russell quit the merchant servicen  the privations of his eight years as a sailor had gravely damaged his health and he was never completely healthy again for the rest of his life the positive legacy from his service was a wealth of material on which he based a successful career as a novelist writeredit russell had an office job with a commercial company for a few months after which he decided to attempt a literary career his first attempt was a fiveact tragedy fra angelico which was staged unsuccessfully in london during  he began work as a journalist and during the next two decades wrote for a variety of newspapers including the newcastle daily chronicle the kent county news and most importantly for him the daily telegraph for which he wrote articles using the pseudonym seafarer during  he married alexandrina henry with whom he had a son and three daughters from the early s russell published novels using pseudonyms sydney mostyn and eliza rhyl davies with modest success the stories of an old seaman at ramsgate gave him the idea of writing about life at sea using on his own experience an obituarist of russell wrote that since the heyday of such writers as captain marryat michael scott and frederick chamier some thirty or forty years before no one in this country had written of the sea from actual knowledge russell during  russell was at first doubtful if stories of merchant navy life could compete with tales of the royal navy only two writers had dealt with the mercantile side of the ocean life – dana the author of two years before the mast and herman melville both of them it is needless to say americans i could not recollect such a book written by an englishman his first attempt at a novel of merchant navy life was john holdsworth chief mate during  which russell later thought of as reluctant and timid in dealing with sea topics it received kindly reviews but russell regarded his next attempt the wreck of the grosvenor  as his first real sea book russell sold the copyright of the wreck of the grosvenor to the publisher sampson low for £ about £ in  terms during the next four years it sold nearly  copies excellent reviews and good sales helped establish russells writing pattern the scholar john sutherland wrote during  that the wreck of the grosvenor was the most popular midvictorian melodrama of adventure and heroism at sea it remained popular and widely read in illustrated editions well into the first half of the th century it was russells bestselling and bestknown novel russell noted in a preface the novel found its first and best welcome in the united states and commented elsewhere that his work was greeted with more enthusiasm in the united states than in britain the biographer g s woods lists among russells best sea novels the frozen pirate  a sailors sweetheart  an ocean tragedy  the death ship  list ye landsmen  and overdue  according to woods russell wrote a total of  novels additionally he published collections of short stories and newspaper articles a volume of historical essays popular biographies william dampier and admirals nelson and collingwood and a collection of verses algernon swinburne described russell as the greatest master of the sea living or dead herman melville admired russells work and dedicated his book john marr and other sailors  to him russell reciprocated dedicating an ocean tragedy to melville during  despite their mutual regard neither writer influenced the others style and it is melvilles works that have proved the more enduring arthur conan doyle made dr watson an admirer in the five orange pips in which he was deep in one of clark russells fine sea stories while temporarily back in b baker street particularly during later years when arthritis made it difficult for him to hold a pen russell dictated his work to a secretary according to the manchester guardian like most dictated work these books have a rather inflated rhetorical literary manner despite this criticism the paper concluded his books are wellproportioned they are well thought out his characters have all been seen even his ships have character no other sea writer except perhaps melville … has given such patient inventive care to the setting in which his characters move … he saw things so clearly that he could make them real in description … in his best books and in his wonderful short stories he has set down the semblance of sea life and of the changing beauty of the waters as faithfully as such things can be done according to woods his descriptions of storms at sea and atmospheric effects were brilliant pieces of word painting but his characterisation was often indifferent and his plots were apt to become monotonous russells books are a favorite of dr john watson the fictional chronicler of sherlock holmes cases as mentioned in the short story the five orange pips by sir arthur conan doyle campaigneredit woods writes that russells sea novels stimulated public interest in the conditions under which sailors lived and thereby paved the way for the reform of many abuses the year after russells death woods wrote a zealous champion in the press of the grievances of the merchant seamen clark russell urged that the hardships of their life were practically unchanged since the repeal of the navigation acts in  and that despite the merchant shipping act of  ships were still sent to sea undermanned and overladen in response to this agitation further acts of parliament to prevent unseaworthy vessels putting to sea were passed in    and  in  clark russell protested against the seamen and firemen not being represented on the shipping commission which was appointed by mr chamberlain in  the duke of york afterwards king george v expressed his opinion that the great improvement in the conditions of the merchant service was due in no small degree to clark russells writings later russell turned his attention to the deplorable provisions that unscrupulous shipowners provided for merchant seamen on their vessels nothing more atrociously nasty could be found amongst the neglected putrid sweepings of a butchers back premises later yearsedit during his last two decades russell became progressively more disabled by arthritis generally regarded as a legacy of his years at sea as a youth – the sailors enemy as the manchester guardian stated he did not allow this to stop him writing the times commented he worked harder than many haler men he went to health resorts including bath droitwich and madeira and after living in ramsgate and deal on the south

literary career his first attempt was a fiveact tragedy fra angelico which was staged unsuccessfully in london during  he began work as a journalist and during the next two decades wrote for a variety of newspapers including the newcastle daily chronicle the kent county news and most importantly for him the daily telegraph for which he wrote articles using the pseudonym seafarer during  he married alexandrina henry with whom he had a son and three daughters from the early s russell published novels using pseudonyms sydney mostyn and eliza rhyl davies with modest success the stories of an old seaman at ramsgate gave him the idea of writing about life at sea using on his own experience an obituarist of russell wrote that since the heyday of such writers as captain marryat michael scott and frederick chamier some thirty or forty years before no one in this country had written of the sea from actual knowledge russell during  russell was at first doubtful if stories of merchant navy life could compete with tales of the royal navy only two writers had dealt with the mercantile side of the ocean life – dana the author of two years before the mast and herman melville both of them it is needless to say americans i could not recollect such a book written by an englishman his first attempt at a novel of merchant navy life was john holdsworth chief mate during  which russell later thought of as reluctant and timid in dealing with sea topics it received kindly reviews but russell regarded his next attempt the wreck of the grosvenor  as his first real sea book russell sold the copyright of the wreck of the grosvenor to the publisher sampson low for £ about £ in  terms during the next four years it sold nearly  copies excellent reviews and good sales helped establish russells writing pattern the scholar john sutherland wrote during  that the wreck of the grosvenor was the most popular midvictorian melodrama of adventure and heroism at sea it remained popular and widely read in illustrated editions well into the first half of the th century it was russells bestselling and bestknown novel russell noted in a preface the novel found its first and best welcome in the united states and commented elsewhere that his work was greeted with more enthusiasm in the united states than in britain the biographer g s woods lists among russells best sea novels the frozen pirate  a sailors sweetheart  an ocean tragedy  the death ship  list ye landsmen  and overdue  according to woods russell wrote a total of  novels additionally he published collections of short stories and newspaper articles a volume of historical essays popular biographies william dampier and admirals nelson and collingwood and a collection of verses algernon swinburne described russell as the greatest master of the sea living or dead herman melville admired russells work and dedicated his book john marr and other sailors  to him russell reciprocated dedicating an ocean tragedy to melville during  despite their mutual regard neither writer influenced the others style and it is melvilles works that have proved the more enduring arthur conan doyle made dr watson an admirer in the five orange pips in which he was deep in one of clark russells fine sea stories while temporarily back in b baker street particularly during later years when arthritis made it difficult for him to hold a pen russell dictated his work to a secretary according to the manchester guardian like most dictated work these books have a rather inflated rhetorical literary manner despite this criticism the paper concluded his books are wellproportioned they are well thought out his characters have all been seen even his ships have character no other sea writer except perhaps melville … has given such patient inventive care to the setting in which his characters move … he saw things so clearly that he could make them real in description … in his best books and in his wonderful short stories he has set down the semblance of sea life and of the changing beauty of the waters as faithfully as such things can be done according to woods his descriptions of storms at sea and atmospheric effects were brilliant pieces of word painting but his characterisation was often indifferent and his plots were apt to become monotonous russells books are a favorite of dr john watson the fictional chronicler of sherlock holmes cases as mentioned in the short story the five orange pips by sir arthur conan doyle campaigneredit woods writes that russells sea novels stimulated public interest in the conditions under which sailors lived and thereby paved the way for the reform of many abuses the year after russells death woods wrote a zealous champion in the press of the grievances of the merchant seamen clark russell urged that the hardships of their life were practically unchanged since the repeal of the navigation acts in  and that despite the merchant shipping act of  ships were still sent to sea undermanned and overladen in response to this agitation further acts of parliament to prevent unseaworthy vessels putting to sea were passed in    and  in  clark russell protested against the seamen and firemen not being represented on the shipping commission which was appointed by mr chamberlain in  the duke of york afterwards king george v expressed his opinion that the great improvement in the conditions of the merchant service was due in no small degree to clark russells writings later russell turned his attention to the deplorable provisions that unscrupulous shipowners provided for merchant seamen on their vessels nothing more atrociously nasty could be found amongst the neglected putrid sweepings of a butchers back premises later yearsedit during his last two decades russell became progressively more disabled by arthritis generally regarded as a legacy of his years at sea as a youth – the sailors enemy as the manchester guardian stated he did not allow this to stop him writing the times commented he worked harder than many haler men he went to health resorts including bath droitwich and madeira and after living in ramsgate and deal on the south coast of england he settled in bath he was bedridden for the last six months of his life russell died at his home in bath at the age of  and his remains are buried in smallcombe cemetery in bath
