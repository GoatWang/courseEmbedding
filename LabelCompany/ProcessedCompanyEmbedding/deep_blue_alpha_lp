represented a highwater mark for scott hansen the san francisco musician better known as tycho described by hansen as “in many ways the first true tycho record” awake announced the arrival of tycho as a full band and it found hansen streamlining the group’s sound focusing on the drums and aiming to capture the energy and power of the group’s live set the story of awake arrives at its natural conclusion with this ” of remixes on which hansen’s songs are reinterpreted by producers who make the songs their own while retaining all of their core elements baio who splits his time between solo work and his role as bassist in vampire weekend gives “plains” a kind of soulfulness adding a driving rhythm to the original’s beatless ambience and dropping in snatches of vocal for texture and warmth rjd takes the swiftkicking “apogee” and transforms it into tranquil instrumental funk in the hands of few nolder “montana” becomes tense and driving fouronthefloor beat undergirding bright rippling synths additional remixes from com truise christopher willits bibio and beacon which had been previously released have been added to this package taken together the awake remixes offer a

joseph abajian dj jab founded fat beats in  with nothing more than a shoestring budget and an earnest obsession with the music the culture and the brotherhood of new york’s burgeoning rap scene what began as a simple vinyl shop in manhattan’s lower east side quickly became an integral hub for artists both aspiring and established to convene and collaborate on new projects joseph’s timing couldn’t have been more impeccable when the ’s cultural zeitgeist – and in turn the music industry establishment – chose hiphop as its new arbiter of coolinternational tourists and touring artists alike flocked to fat beats for rare vinyl kindred spirits and exclusive instore performances from jay z eminem gang starr outkast slum village mos def and more one thing was clear the fat beats phenomenon could no longer be contained in a single basement shopin the late nineties abajian proceeded to open new stores in amsterdam tokyo los angeles and atlanta he further expanded the company’s profile to

interchangeably as it can be set to any time zone you wish exhibition case or back unique complication wherein a crystal window is implemented into the back of a watch case allowing view of the timepieces movement function pushers manual controls on a case for when a movement features complications that require increased manipulation greenwich mean time gmt also referred to as greenwich meridian time the greenwich meridian line is located at the royal observatory in greenwich england it is the place from where all time zones are measured greenwich mean time is the average time that earth takes to rotate from noon to noon in this regard gmt is thought of as the worlds time and was once the basis with which every other zone set time guilloche style of engraving that features wavy or straight lines giving a unique effect when the timepiece is moved or shifted ionic plating process that produces a hardened surface that is durable and scratchresistant has a black flat stealth finish jewels within a movement metal on metal contact creates wear and tear watchmakers use jewel bearings to reduce friction and help the delicate parts of the movement work smoothly and with great precision jewels help extend the movements life diamonds sapphires rubies and garnets are the preferred materials as a general rule a higher number of jewels suggests a more prestigious movement lugs north and south ends of the case that attach to the strap or bracelet and often extend out from the dominant lines of the case moon phase the lunar cycle has been a cornerstone of horology the study of measuring time since ancient days moon phase is a complication on a timepiece that displays the various stages of the moon cycles from waxing to waning it appears as a dial visible through an aperture which reveals the current moon phase movement assembly making up the principal elements and mechanisms of a watch or clock includes the winding and setting mechanism the mainspring the train the escapement and the regulating elements power reserve time a watch will continue running based on the movements residual winding of its mainspring in quartz and digital watches this can also refer to the amount of energy left in the battery push button dual deployant similar to deployant and considered one of the most desirable and easytouse clasps the push button dual deployant employs two small hidden push buttons that release the bracelet this clasp keeps the closing mechanism hidden for an uninterrupted seamless finish repeater complex watch mechanism that sounds hours quarters or minutes or repeats them on request originally designed to help the wearer to tell the time in the dark retrograde hour minute second or calendar hand that moves across a scale and resets to zero at the end of its cycle skeletonization reveals the intricate symphony of moving rotors gears and springs which power a timepiece the open design offers an insiders view as unnecessary metal is cut away to allow the wearer to actually see the movements skeleton swiss made since the th century switzerland has been the epicenter of watch making producing some of the industrys greatest technological advances the swiss put a law into effect for all timepieces baring the words swiss made first the movement must be assembled in switzerland secondly the movement must be cased up in switzerland finally the manufacturer must carry out the timepieces final inspection in switzerland tachymeter scale on a watch used to determine units per hour such as average speed over a fixed distance or distance based on speed typically located along the outer rim of a dial tritium miniature tubes containing gaseous tritium and layered with phosphor to power the luminous accents which can be seen for several meters in darkness tritium illumination requires no electrical power but must be charged by holding your watch close to any light source the longer you hold it there the longer and brighter youll see the tritnite unidirectional rotating bezel used for tracking elapsed time a ratchet mechanism prevents the bezel from rotating backwards this feature is popular with divers who rely on the elapsed time feature to prevent the diver from running out of air the fact that the bezel cannot rotate backwards prevents the wearer from underestimating the elapsed timeabout stainless steel also called corrosion resistant steel stainless steel is a steel alloy with added iron and chromium the metal is rustresistant durable and highly lustrous it has a similar appearance to platinum and polishes to a glistening sheen any scratches that may occur from day to day wear can be easily buffed away without endangering the piece please note however if the stainless steel is plated with another metal the plating can wear off if rubbed excessively against hard surfaces stainless steel was first recognized in france in  by metallurgist pierre berthier after several corrosionresistance related discoveries and patents in europe and the united states harry brearley in england discovered a modern blend of stainless steel alloy when it was announced by the new york times in january of  he was officially credited with the invention of this impressive modern metal unidirectional rotating bezel used for tracking elapsed time a ratchet mechanism prevents the bezel from rotating backwards this feature is popular with divers who rely on the elapsed time feature to prevent the diver from running out of air the fact that the bezel cannot rotate backwards prevents the wearer from underestimating the elapsed time automatic an automatic movement requires the same artful execution to create and contains virtually all of the same components as a mechanical movement  but with one notable addition an automatic movement relies on the motion of the wearers arm to spin an offbalanced weight called the rotor a collection of gears inside the case utilizes the movement of the rotor to automatically wind the mainspring and power the watch a slipping mechanism on the mainspring prevents the damaging effects of overwinding automatic watches require movement in order to function properly and will stop ticking after a period of dormancy when the reserve power in the mainspring is depleted timepieces with automatic movements are meant to be appreciated for the craftsmanship and complex aesthetic that they provide the case provides the foundation for all other major watch components it houses the movement maintains the lugs for attachment to the bracelet or strap plays host to various crowns and function pushers and seats the crystal and bezel cases exist in a variety of shapes and sizes and utilize a library of materials for construction such as stainless steel gold ceramic titanium plastic and more the dominance of stainless steel in case construction remains however hypoallergenic metals and materials like titanium continue to gain in popularity metal cases often have particular finishes  such as a smooth reflective polish or circular matte brush  that enhance the presentation of the timepiece and give it unique depth some designs allow for the case and lugs to be curved in order for the watch to have a more comfortable fit around the wrist the back of a case will typically be removable and most likely be screw down or popoff it is important to note however it should only be opened by a trained professional an exhibition feature found within a cases back refers to an added window that allows you to view the movement and is often found on
