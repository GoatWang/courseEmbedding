recently to further its development of software to protect critical infrastructure owned by private industry — like the electric grid dragos inc is a hybrid product and services startup that creates cybersecurity tools for businesses to hunt for unauthorized users lurking around industrial control systems inside their networks from nuclear power plants to chemical manufacturers enlarge cofounders of dragos inc a cybersecurity company with an office in san antonio from… more the startup raised  million from datatribe — described as a startup studio which is a mix between an angel incubator and a venture capital firm — based in the washington dc region the seed capital is being used to build a threat operations center or a cybersecurity analyst hub that can hunt remotely for known and unknown threat actors inside a companys infrastructure it costs about  million to hire specialized analysts and the equipment needed for the center according to estimates from pricewaterhousecoopers llp most threat operations centers focus on hunting for hackers or malware across a companys computer system not typically industrial control systems datatribe is an investor group focused on military veteranled companies looking to commercialize products across cybersecurity from big data to the internet of things it is backed by deloitte allegis capital and yahoo japan alamo city ties while dragos has its main office at datatribe the startup has a satellite office in san antonio for now and aims to hire more cybersecurity analysts in the alamo city in the coming months thats because the companys cofounder and ceo robert lee has lived in san antonio for years after he was transferred to joint base san antonio lackland air force base for about five years he worked as a cyberwarfare operations officer lee is now pursuing a doctorate in war studies at kings college of london focusing on the attack and defense of control systems alongside developing dragos a few years ago dragos built a cybersecurity tool called cyberlens that enabled businesses to watch unauthorized users navigate their networks like a magnifying glass although it is not the focus of the companys products currently under development the startup aims to stand out from its competitors mostly highgrowth tech startups based in israel by leveraging experience securing the us infrastructure while in the military a lot of whats being developed in the market are built by pure software developers so they are difficult to use for analysts lee said in a recent interview we have our threat operations center not only generating revenue but driving the development of future workflow and tools so that our platform is easier to use for security analysts assembling a team in september dragos hired ben miller — former associate director at the electricity information sharing  analysis center created by the north american electricity reliability corp — to lead its threat operations center the other company cofounders were stationed at fort meade an army post in maryland with a high concentration of cyberwarfarerelated activity before forming dragos cofounder jon lavender worked as a data scientist and senior network analyst at the us department of defense in maryland for nearly eight years justin cavinee was a software developer and senior network analyst for the defense department dragos was one of several companies from the private sector selected recently to begin working on a test bed with the university of illinois at urbana–champaign the university was awarded an  million grant from the defense advanced research projects agency to develop technology that would enable the us electric grid to recover after an attack on its infrastructure dragos was founded in  under the
