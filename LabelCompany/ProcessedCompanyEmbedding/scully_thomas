zalesin eugene tillman and helen g kirsch were on the brief for appellee ortho biotech products lp before henderson and rogers circuit judges and williams senior circuit judge opinion for the court filed by circuit judge rogers rogers circuit judge  the principal issue on appeal is whether the court has jurisdiction of a complaint filed by amgen inc the manufacturer of an anemia treatment aranesp challenging an adjustment to the medicare part b rate at which the federal government pays hospitals for using its product the district court dismissed amgens complaint for lack of prudential standing although we hold that amgen has prudential standing we affirm the dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction i  title xviii of the social security act of   usc §  et seq establishes the medicare program which provides federally funded medical insurance to the elderly and disabled part a of the medicare program provides insurance coverage for inpatient hospital care home health care and hospice services id § c part b of medicare is a voluntary program that provides supplemental coverage for other types of care including outpatient hospital care id §§ j k the medicare program is subject to both fiscal limits and restrictions on administrative and judicial review we address the former as applied to amgen in part i and the latter in part iii  a component of the medicare b program is the outpatient prospective payment system opps which pays hospitals directly to provide outpatient services to beneficiaries to control costs opps rather than reimbursing providers afterthefact for their reasonable expenses in any given year as was done prior to  pays hospitals prospectively for their services in each upcoming year thus requiring payments for outpatient hospital care to be made based on predetermined rates see balanced budget act of  publ no   stat   as relevant here opps payments governed by  usc § lt are calculated through a formula setting payment weights for the provision of certain services or certain groups of clinically similar services based on the mean or median costs of providing such services in past years with adjustments for regional cost variations id at §§ ltc  td pursuant to amendments to the outpatient prospective payment system in the balanced budget refinement act of  publ no   stat   the secretary of the department of health and human services the secretary then additionally modifies those resulting payment amounts hospitals facing actual costs significantly above their prospective payment amounts receive outlier adjustments  usc §§ lte  t hospitals also receive supplemental payments called passthrough payments to help cover the cost of providing certain treatments including new drugs biologicals and medical devices id § lt hereafter § t under § t when a drug biological or medical device becomes eligible for passthrough status hospitals providing it to beneficiaries receive supplemental payments equal to  of the wholesale cost of the treatment minus whatever amount the hospital would otherwise receive through the prospective payment system §§ tdi  uo for a period of two to three years § ltc at the end of that period the treatment is factored into the normal prospective payment system more generally the secretary also has authority in light of his or her significant expertise and judgment grounded in policy concerns over medicares complex and highly technical regulatory program see tenet healthsystems healthcorp v thompson  fd   dccir  quoting thomas jefferson univ v shalala  us    s ct    l ed d   internal quotation omitted to make other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments  usc § lte hereafter § te no supplemental funding is available for these three types of adjustments when the secretary makes any of the three — outlier adjustments passthrough adjustments or other equitable adjustments — any additional projected expenses must be offset by a reduction in all prospective payment rates § te supplemental passthrough payments are additionally subject to a cap they may not exceed a fixed percentage of opps payments and must be reduced pro rata in the event they exceed that limit § te  amgen is the manufacturer of darbepoetin alpha also known as aranesp a relatively recent biological product used to treat anemia in chemotherapy and kidney disease patients  fedreg   nov   a similar product epoetin alpha was developed in the late s and is presently marketed both as amgens own predecessor product epogen and the product of its competitor and intervenor here ortho biotech products procrit id providers are presently compensated for providing epoetin alpha to beneficiaries through the regular prospective payment system while the parties disagree about the significance of molecular differences between darbepoetin alpha and epoetin alpha aranesp differs clinically in that it has a longer halflife such that many patients require less frequent dosages and therefore fewer hospital visits id  amgen applied on november   to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms known prior to july   as the health care financing administration which as relevant here administers the medicare part b program for transitional passthrough newdrug status so that hospitals would receive supplemental payments for providing aranesp to medicare part b beneficiaries see § taiv according to the complaint in september  and july  respectively the federal drug administration approved aranesp for marketing as a treatment for kidney diseaserelated anemia and for chemotherapyrelated anemia cms sent amgen an approval letter on february   and on march   cms included aranesp in the reimbursement rates for  to be effective april    fedreg   march   cmss proposed  opps rates published on august   also included passthrough payments for aranesp  fedreg   aug   the proposed rule stated however that the passthrough provisions had been exceptionally difficult to implement and that cms was actively seeking comment on all aspects of these proposed rates explaining that it was open to making changes perhaps significant to the proposed rates based on comments received id at  ortho biotech the manufacturer of procrit submitted comments questioning the passthrough payments for aranesp in light of its purported similarity to procrit  fedreg   nov   amgen responded that the two biologicals were not substitutes and that reimbursement amounts for aranesp should not be determined in reference to procrit  on november   the secretary published the final rule setting  opps rates  fedreg  nov   claiming to act pursuant to the authority in § te to make adjustments  to ensure equitable payments cms adjusted payments for aranesp to the level hospitals would receive under the prospective payment system effectively eliminating the supplemental passthrough payment for the biological id at  the decision to reduce payments was predicated on the availability of the clinically similar yet cheaper procrit and noted that it was not an equitable or efficient use of medicare funds to pay for these two functionally equivalent products at greatly different rates id because no historical cost data were available to calculate aranesps reimbursement level under the prospective payment system pursuant to § tc cms calculated a reimbursement amount using what it determined to be the equivalent dosage ratio between procrit and aranesp id at  as an alternative ground for the decision the final rule stated that aranesp is not new for passthrough purposes under § taiv because it is functionally equivalent to procrit and epogen id at   amgen sued the administrator of cms and the secretary on the ground that the rule reducing its passthrough payments violated the plain language of the medicare act amgen argued that under § t the secretary is required to make passthrough payments for new treatments and can only reduce those payments when necessary to keep total passthrough payments under the statutory cap and then only on a pro rata basis for all passthrough products alleging violations of its procedural rights as well amgen argued that the rule was arbitrary and capricious and that procedural irregularities violated amgens rights under the administrative procedure act and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution the district court allowed ortho biotech to intervene on the question of whether amgen had standing to bring the suit relying in large part on the fourth circuits decision in tap pharmaceuticals v us dept of health  fd  th cir the district court ruled that amgen as a drug manufacturer not itself regulated by or within the zone of interests of the relevant portion of the medicare act lacked prudential standing and dismissed the complaint amgen v scully  f supp d  ddc ii  amgen appeals the dismissal of its complaint on the ground that the district courts ruling that it lacks prudential standing to challenge opps payment amounts for its product conflicts with this courts precedent as well as that of the supreme court the court reviews de novo the dismissal of a complaint accepting as true the allegations of the complaint see american federation of govt employees aflcio v rumsfeld  fd   dccir  section a of the administrative procedure act  usc §   apa provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute is entitled to judicial review thereof the supreme court has held that to qualify as adversely affected or aggrieved  within the meaning of a statute a plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of  falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint lujan v natl wildlife federation  us    s ct    l ed d   quoting clarke v securities industry assn  us    s ct    l ed d   a partys claimed injury from administrative action therefore will be considered within the meaning of the relevant statute for purposes of  usc §  only if the party can meet the socalled zone of interests test qualified plaintiffs include not only those who are themselves the subject of the contested regulatory action clarke  us at   sct at  but also those whose interests are not so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit id amgen contends that it is the subject of the secretarys action and that its interests are consistent with the statutory scheme we hold that amgens interests are congruent with interests underlying the medicare act and do not reach the question whether it is a regulated party  the supreme court has explained that the zone of interests test is not meant to be especially demanding clarke  us at   sct at  thus there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the wouldbe plaintiff id at   sct at  not only need a party not be a beneficiary of a statute a putative partys objectives in the action need not be eleemosynary in nature whether they are is beside the point natl cred union admin v first national bank  us    s ct    l ed d   congruence of interests rather than identity of interests is the benchmark the zone of interests test serves to exclude only those parties whose interests are not consistent with the purposes of the statute in question ethyl corp v epa  fd   dccir because lawsuits by such plaintiffs carry a considerable potential for judicial intervention that would distort the regulatory process hazardous waste treatment council v epa  fd   dccir  parties motivated by purely commercial interests routinely satisfy the zone of interests test under this courts precedents as the court observed in mova pharmaceutical corp v shalala  fd   dccir the salient consideration under the apa is whether the challengers interests are such that they in practice can be expected to police the interests that the statute protects see also animal legal defense fund v glickman  fd   dccir en banc cert denied sub nom natl assn for biomedical research v animal legal defense fund inc  us   s ct   l ed d   manufacturers challenges to agency actions then fall within the zone of interests of a statute when their interests appear congruent with those of the statute for instance in ethyl corp  fd at  a manufacturer of fuel additives had prudential standing under the clean air act to challenge regulations applied to automobile manufacturers because as the developer of products that will reduce harmful air pollutants the companys interests appear congruent with those of the statute id similarly in motor  equipment mfrs assn v nichols  fd   dccir the court held that the manufacturers of replacement automobile parts could challenge under the clean air act the agencys order permitting california to prohibit tampering with pollution monitors reasoning that the manufacturers commercial interest in selling replacement parts was congruent with those of mechanics and ultimately of the statute and in natl cottonseed products assn v brock  fd   dccir the manufacturers of respirators had prudential standing to challenge the effectiveness of osha regulations in filtering cotton dust on the basis of the vendorvendee relationship alone id quoting faic securities v federal deposit insurance corporation  fd   dccir  amgens commercial interest in a full statutory reimbursement rate for aranesp is neither incidental nor antagonistic to the purposes of § t the statutory provision whose violation forms the basis for the complaint bennett v spear  us    s ct    l ed d   congress adopted § t as an amendment to the medicare act in  because the proposed outpatient prospective payments did not adequately address issues pertaining to the treatment of drugs biologicals and new technology and to prevent restricted beneficiary access to drugs biologicals and new technology hr rep i at   amgens commercial interest in selling aranesp is congruent with the interests of beneficiaries in obtaining access to the technology because congress reason for providing supplemental passthrough payments was that hospitals inadequately reimbursed for new drugs or biologicals are less likely to provide them and more likely to steer beneficiaries towards older less expensive treatments the required offset to other reimbursements caused by supplemental payments for aranesp under § tes budgetneutrality requirement does not create a disqualifying conflict between amgen and beneficiaries there would be such an offset as a result of any successful challenge brought by any eligible plaintiff seeking access to a new treatment moreover just as beneficiaries desiring access to aranesp and hospitals desiring reimbursement for providing it would have prudential standing to challenge passthrough payment amounts amgen as a vendor does as well cf natl cottonseed products assn  fd at  this is true irrespective of whether hospitals or beneficiaries could file lawsuits whether amgens claim is ultimately precluded is a separate question from whether it has prudential standing to file a lawsuit unlike hazardous waste treatment council  fd  where the court held that an association of pollution equipment providers lacked standing to challenge the agencys adoption of allegedly too weak regulations and that the statute did not manifest congressional intent to improve the competitive position of suppliers of more expensive pollution control devices id at  here the purpose of the passthrough provision is precisely to attract supply of higherpriced items making amgen a suitable challenger  the district court concluded that amgens competitive interest in financial gain was not closely aligned with the federal health care insurance act amgen  fsuppd at  in reaching this conclusion the court focused on the broad purpose of the medicare act to provide more adequate and feasible health insurance protection for the elderly id at  and neglected the more specific interest protected by § t itself namely preventing restricted beneficiary access to drugs biologicals and new technology hr rep i at  under the precedents discussed the fact that amgens motives were commercial is not disqualifying and in distinguishing this circuits precedent the district court did not give adequate weight to amgens financial alignment with congress purpose in § t of increasing beneficiary access to new medical technology the district courts reliance on tap pharmaceuticals v us dept of health  fd  th cir was also misplaced for in holding that drug manufacturers lack prudential standing to challenge the medicare b rates at which providers are reimbursed for their drugs the fourth circuit limited the standing of commercial entities to regulated firms their competitors and other firms whose interests put them in the same position id at  a test that this court has rejected see tax analysts  advocates v blumenthal  fd   dccir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   adopting a more flexible approach that focuses instead on whether a party in practice can be expected to police the interests that the statute protects mova pharmaceutical corp  fd at  is more faithful to the supreme courts teachings in clarke  us at   sct at  that parties are denied a right to judicial review only when their interests are marginally related to or inconsistent with the statute at issue and in natl credit union admin  us at   sct at  rejecting as beside the point whether a putative plaintiffs objectives are the same as those intended by congress the commercial competitors of regulated parties tap pharmaceuticals  fd at  and those in the same position id may be examples of parties whose interests sufficiently align with some statutory schemes to confer prudential standing but the court sees no reason to consider them the only parties so situated  accordingly we hold that amgens interests are sufficiently aligned with the purpose of § t in ensuring the access of medicare beneficiaries to new technology and consequently it has prudential standing to sue the secretary and the administrator iii  that amgen has prudential standing does not resolve this appeal however another threshold issue is whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain amgens complaint the administrator and secretary contend that adjustments to opps rates are not subject to judicial review this court may affirm the dismissal of a complaint on different grounds than those relied upon by the district court see bennett v spear  us    s ct    l ed d   the courts jurisdiction is a pure question of law and as the merits do not hinge on any factfinding or discretionary balancing of competing interests a remand to the district court is unnecessary compare mcgrawhill cos inc v procter  gamble co  us    s ct    l ed d   eeoc v natl childrens ctr inc  fd   dccir  under § te the medicare act authorizes the secretary to make adjustments to the payments hospitals receive under the outpatient prospective payment system  e the secretary shall establish in a budget neutral manner outlier adjustments under paragraph  and transitional passthrough payments under paragraph  and other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments such as adjustments for certain classes of hospitals   usc § lte regarding judicial review of the secretarys adjustments the medicare act provides in pertinent part  there shall be no administrative or judicial review under section ff oo of this title or otherwise of —  a the development of the prospective payment classification system under paragraph  including the establishment of groups and relative payment weights for covered opd outpatient department services of wage adjustment factors other adjustments and methods described in paragraph f regarding measures to control unnecessary increases in the volume of covered opd services  id § lta hereafter § ta in order to determine whether the court has jurisdiction to consider amgens complaint the court must determine first whether the other adjustments of which § ta precludes review include the other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments authorized by § te and second whether the secretary may use the equitable adjustment authority under § te to alter a payment amount to which a hospital would have been otherwise been entitled pursuant to the passthrough provision in § t because we hold that § ta precludes review of the equitable adjustments made pursuant to § te and that the secretary through cms acted within the authority under § te in adjusting the passthrough payment amount for aranesp our review of dhhss decision is at an end  there is a strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action bowen v michigan academy of family physicians  us    s ct    l ed d   and it can only be overcome by a clear and convincing evidence that congress intended to preclude the suit abbott laboratories v gardner  us    s ct    l ed d   quoting rusk v cort  us    s ct    l ed d   the presumption is particularly strong that congress intends judicial review of agency action taken in excess of delegated authority see leedom v kyne  us    s ct    l ed d   aid assn for lutherans v us postal service  fd   dccir such review is favored the court stated in dart v united states  fd   dccir if the wording of a preclusion clause is less than absolute  the court therefore turns to the statutes language structure and purpose its legislative history and whether the claims can be afforded meaningful review thunder basin coal co v reich  us    s ct    l ed d   that congress intended to preclude judicial review of the secretarys adjustments to prospective payment amounts is clear and convincing from the plain text of § t alone the text of § te stipulates that there shall be no administrative or judicial review of other adjustments the legislative history reflects this stipulation see hr rep  at  that congress would use such language of prohibition is unsurprising for piecemeal review of individual payment determinations could frustrate the efficient operation of the complex prospective payment system cf block v community nutrition inst  us    s ct    l ed d   payments to hospitals are made on a prospective basis and given the length of time that review of individual payment determinations could take review could result in the retroactive ordering of payment adjustments after hospitals have already received their payments for the year moreover both the passthrough and equitable adjustments to payment rates are subject to a budgetneutrality requirement under § te such that judicially mandated changes in one payment rate would affect the aggregate impact of the secretarys decisions by requiring offsets elsewhere and thereby interfere with the secretarys ability to ensure budget neutrality in each fiscal year other circuits have noted the havoc that piecemeal review of opps payments could bring about see skagit county pub hosp dist no  v shalala  fd   th cir american socy of cataract  refractive surgery v thompson  fd   th cir and this court has noted similar concerns with respect to the prospective payment system the medicare a program utilizes to reimburse hospitals for the costs of providing inpatient care see methodist hosp of sacramento v shalala  fd   dccir county of los angeles v shalala  fd   dccir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d    in light of the presumption that congress rarely intends to foreclose review of action exceeding agency authority however see leedom  us at   sct at  aid assn  fd at  dart  fd at  we construe § te to prevent review only of those other adjustments that the medicare act authorizes the secretary to make in other words the preclusion on review of other adjustments extends no further than the secretarys statutory authority to make them first the reference to other adjustments in § ta appears alongside other components of outpatient prospective payments that are contemplated by the act such as the establishment of relative payment weights and wage adjustment factors the canon of statutory construction noscitur a sociis ie a word is known by the company it keeps cf washington state dept of social and health services v guardianship estate of keffeler  us    s ct    l ed d   which is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid giving unintended breadth to the acts of congress jarecki v gd searle  co  us    s ct    l ed d   suggests that the reference to other adjustments in § ta should similarly be confined to those other adjustments otherwise provided for in the act and at least creates sufficient ambiguity to trigger the presumption that judicial review of allegedly ultra vires agency action is favored second the text in § ta — other adjustments — matches the language of other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments in § te implying that congress intended to reference adjustments made pursuant to that subsection third the interference with the administration of the medicare b program that would result from judicial review pertaining to the overall scope of the secretarys statutory adjustment authority as opposed to casebycase review of the reasonableness or procedural propriety of the secretarys individual applications would be sufficiently offset by the likely gains from reducing the risk of systematic misinterpretation in the administration of the medicare b program in the similar context of prospective payments to hospitals providing inpatient services under the medicare a program which also operates under budgetneutrality constraints review of the validity of certain systemwide determinations by the secretary has been held to be available notwithstanding an express preclusion on review of individual determinations see universal health services of mcallen inc v sullivan  f supp   ddc affd  fd  table dccir  proceeding then on the basis that § ta precludes judicial review of any adjustment made by the secretary pursuant to the equitable adjustment authority under § te but not of those for which such authority is lacking the court turns to the question of whether § te authorizes the type of adjustment the secretary acting through cms made here this requires consideration of the merits of amgens claim that the secretarys decision to eliminate passthrough payments for aranesp violated § t which dictates the manner in which such payments are to be calculated if a noreview provision shields particular types of administrative action a court may not inquire whether a challenged agency decision is arbitrary capricious or procedurally defective but it must determine whether the challenged agency action is of the sort shielded from review otherwise agencies could characterize reviewable or unauthorized action as falling within the scope of noreview provisions whose application to such action congress did not intend in such cases the determination of whether the court has jurisdiction is intertwined with the question of whether the agency has authority for the challenged action and the court must address the merits to the extent necessary to determine whether the challenged agency action falls within the scope of the preclusion on judicial review  most apposite is comsat corp v fcc  fd  dccir the communications act of  provides the federal communications commission with authority to make certain amendments to fees and includes in the same paragraph a provision stipulating that amendments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review  usc § b  the court held that it had jurisdiction to review whether the commissions fee changes fell within the scope of the commissions authority under the paragraph and that the commissions position that it was acting pursuant to authority shielded from review did not end the matter the statute merges consideration of the legality of the commissions action with consideration of this courts jurisdiction in cases in which the challenge to the commissions action raises the question of the commissions authority to enact a particular amendment where as here we find that the commission has acted outside the scope of its statutory mandate we also find that we have jurisdiction to review the commissions action  fd at  similarly in ei du pont de nemours  co v train  us    s ct    l ed d   involving a challenge to regulations promulgated by the environmental protection agency pursuant to the federal water pollution control act the supreme court faced a statutory scheme whereby review was available in the court of appeals for agency action taken pursuant to a particular section of the act but the parties were in disagreement regarding whether that section authorized the agency to issue regulations the supreme court held that the issue of jurisdiction is intertwined with the issue of epas power to issue the regulations and proceeded to address the merits id at   sct at   the court therefore must determine whether § te authorizes the secretary to alter a passthrough payment otherwise required by § t if it does review is precluded if it does not because the court construes § ta as only shielding from review other adjustments contemplated by the medicare act the preclusion of review would not apply to shield the secretarys unauthorized action the effect of the interplay of these statutory provisions is also to render irrelevant amgens contentions that the secretarys elimination of the passthrough payment for aranesp was arbitrary capricious and procedurally deficient if the secretary is authorized to alter passthrough payments judicial review is precluded and it does not matter how the secretary made the decision if the secretary is not so authorized even a procedurally proper and reasonably explained decision would be contrary to law because it would be ultra vires  on the merits amgens statutory claim is defeated by the text of § te the plain meaning of the secretarys equitable adjustment authority permits the type of adjustment that the secretary acting through cms made here under § te the secretary may make other adjustments to hospital payments beyond those already allowed under by the statute as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments it is difficult to see how a decision by the secretary to adjust passthrough payments for a specific treatment downward based on the secretarys conclusion that the treatment is too costly relative to its benefits would not lie at the heart of such authority the text of § te by authorizing the secretary to adjust payments where necessary to ensure equitable payments manifests congresss recognition that the payment system might otherwise sometimes produce inequitable results the house and conference reports to the balanced budget act of  publ no   stat   state that that act gives the secretary discretion in determining the adjustment factors that will be applied to opd prospective rates hr rep  at   hr conf rep no  at   that discretion is what was exercised here  amgen presents several arguments for why the secretarys decision to alter aranesp passthrough payments is not the sort of adjustment authorized under § te but none are persuasive it relies primarily on a textual argument relating to the words shall and other amgen maintains that § t which sets forth the means for calculating passthrough payments provides in § ta that the secretary shall make passthrough payments as does § te and describes the manner of their calculation focusing on the specificity of § ts instructions — that passthrough payments shall equal  of the wholesale cost of the drug or biological minus the payment amount under the prospective payment system §§ td  uo that the payments shall continue for no fewer than two years and no more than three § tc and that all passthrough payments shall be reduced pro rata in the event that total passthrough payments exceed a fixed percentage of total payments for that year § te — amgen contends that the secretary acted unlawfully in using the equitable adjustment authority to override the clear statutory mandate to make passthrough payments in the prescribed manner amgen points to the pro rata reductions required by § te and shielded from review by § lte and contends that because pro rata reductions to avoid budgetary overruns are the only reductions to passthrough payments addressed in § t the secretarys authority to reduce passthrough payments is correspondingly limited amgen also contends that the legislative history of § te supports its reading of the word shall prior to  § te provided that the secretary shall establish other adjustments in a budget neutral manner as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments such as outlier adjustments or adjustments for certain classes of hospitals this language was changed in the balanced budget refinement act of  publ no   stat   so that § te now provides that the secretary shall establish  outlier payments  passthrough payments and other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments amgen contends that the new language by changing outlier payments from an example of an equitable adjustment the secretary may consider into an adjustment the secretary shall establish reduced the secretarys discretion both for outlier payments and passthrough payments the secretarys discretionary authority amgen maintains is therefore limited to other adjustments — adjustments to rates other than those already adjusted by the outlier and passthrough payment provisions  this line of reasoning reads too much into the shall in §§ te and ta in the balanced budget refinement act congress made outlier and passthrough payments mandatory but they are mandatory only in the same sense that regional adjustments in § td and the use of past cost data in § tc are mandatory they are part of default opps rate calculations subject to later adjustment congress amendments to § te do not mean that congress also eliminated the secretarys discretion to make further equitable adjustments to payment rates already adjusted through the outlier or passthrough provisions similar uses of the statutory term shall elsewhere for the medicare b program suggest the opposite almost every provision in § lt governing opps payments requires that the secretary shall compute payment amounts in a certain manner the secretary shall develop a classification system for covered services § ta shall use median or mean cost data to establish payment weights for those services § tc shall determine wage adjustment factors § td other than the secretarys authority to group clinically similar services together for payment purposes pursuant to § tb opps payments are calculated almost entirely based on steps the secretary shall take if use of the word shall makes those payments final there would be nothing left for the secretary to adjust pursuant to § te for other adjustments would violate a shall provision congress use of the term shall to describe opps calculations throughout § t thus contemplates the qualification that initial payment amounts are subject to later adjustment subject to the secretarys discretion hr rep  at  hr conf rep no  at  the balanced budget refinement act used the same terminology in adding passthrough and outlier payments to the initial calculation of opps payments and there is nothing in the act to suggest that congress intended to bar adjustments by the secretary  congress recent amendment to § lt in §  of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  publ no  highlights the secretarys flexibility under § te as amended § tf bars the secretary after the date of enactment december   from calculating passthrough payments for drugs or biologicals in future rates using a functional equivalence standard although determinations of functional equivalence made prior to the date of enactment may still be used in future rates so long as they are made only to determine eligibility for passthrough adjustments and not to calculate other opps payments id at §   usc § ltfii the amendment only applies on or after december   id so it does not apply retroactively of its own force to the  opps rates at issue here the new limitation on the future application of a functional equivalence standard to passthrough payments however by permitting the continuation of some such calculations made prior to december   § tfiii contemplates the secretarys authority to apply such a standard in the first instance yet if amgens interpretation of §§ te and ta were correct and the clear statutory mandate by which § t sets passthrough payments cannot be altered there would be no opportunity to apply a functional equivalence standard to passthrough payments to begin with payment amounts would have been finally set under § td which sets total payments for passthrough drugs and biologicals at  of wholesale costs congress did not enact such an inflexible system  nor as amgen contends does a flexible understanding of the secretarys equitable adjustment authority under § te render superfluous § te which prevents review of only certain decisions related to the calculation of passthrough payments amgen maintains that if the secretary could make equitable adjustments to passthrough payments it would be redundant for the medicare act also to exempt decisions about matters such as the duration of payments or the application of any pro rata reduction from judicial review because the secretary could make all such decisions as equitable adjustments under § te and shield them from review under § ta this is not a redundancy at all the initial setting of opps rates and later adjustments are different decisions amgen does not point to any concrete way in which the secretary could use the equitable adjustment authority to shield a calculation or decision for which the medicare act contemplates review section te is not exhaustive it lists calculations the secretary would make while setting passthrough payments in the first instance the fact that congress also used § ta to shield any later adjustments to those initial rates pursuant to § te is not a redundancy nor for that matter is the breadth of the noreview provisions surprising given congress reasons for limiting review see skagit county pub hosp dist no  v shalala  fd   th cir american socy of cataract  refractive surgery v thompson  fd   th cir cf methodist hosp of sacramento v shalala  fd   dccir county of los angeles v shalala  fd   dccir  cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d    the secretarys equitable adjustment authority that enables the adjustment of opps payments otherwise set by the medicare act including passthrough payments would not as amgen contends give the secretary the absurdly broad power to make drastic adjustments such as the elimination of the entire passthrough program and term it an equitable adjustment thereby undermining the mandatory nature of the passthrough payment system while evading judicial review limitations on the secretarys equitable adjustment authority inhere in the text of § te which only authorizes adjustments not total elimination or severe restructuring of the statutory scheme as in mci telecommunications corp v american tel  tel co  us    s ct    l ed d   where the supreme court held that the federal communication commissions authority to modify certain requirements could not reasonably be read to encompass the power to make basic and fundamental changes in the scheme such as eliminating them entirely similar limits inhere in the term adjustments to those the supreme court found in the word modify the statutory requirement that the secretary shall develop certain aspects of the payment system is qualified by the secretarys authority to adjust those payment amounts but a more substantial departure from the default amounts would at some point violate the secretarys statutory obligation to make such payments and cease to be an adjustment  because the secretary would in that event exceed his statutory authority under § te the preclusion on judicial review in § ta would not apply cf leedom v kyne  us at   sct at  dart v united states  fd at  but because the adjustment to which amgen objects involving only the payment amount for a single drug does not work basic and fundamental changes in the scheme congress created in the medicare act mci telecommunications corp  us at   sct at  but is rather of the sort contemplated by the plain text of § te the court has no occasion to engage in line drawing to determine when adjustments cease being adjustments  finally the court does not reach the question of whether review of amgens constitutional claim is barred as it is not properly before us amgen contends in its reply brief that the court has jurisdiction to review amgens constitutional claim that the administrative process violated its due process rights under the fourteenth amendment irrespective of whether § ta shields the adjustment from review the court has repeatedly held that an argument first made in a reply brief ordinarily comes too late for our consideration students against genocide v department of state  fd   dccir see also bd of regents of the univ of washington v epa  fd   dccir there is no reference in the district courts opinion to amgens constitutional claim and amgens main brief mentions neither its constitutional claim nor the district courts failure to address it instead amgens main brief seeks reversal only of the district courts ruling on prudential standing under the medicare act and the apa notwithstanding the irrelevance of such a requirement to constitutional claims see clarke  us at  n   sct at  n  and its awareness of the secretarys arguments in the district court that judicial review of amgens complaint which included a constitutional claim was precluded the secretarys brief on appeal does not address whether the court has jurisdiction of the constitutional claim made in amgens complaint as amgen mentions that claim for the first time in its reply brief under these circumstances the court has no occasion to make exception to its usual refusal to address contentions raised for the first time in a reply brief  accordingly we affirm the dismissal of amgens complaint although we hold that amgen has prudential standing to bring its complaint we also hold that the court lacks jurisdiction under § ta to consider amgens complaint challenging the secretarys exercise of the equitable adjustment

posted on december   by thomas scully  some things we see in nature we describe as phenomena because we cannot explain them  one phenomenon for many years was the ability of geckos to stick to walls or other surfaces with great ease  we’ve all probably wished for this “spidermanlike ability” at one time or another in our life but never been able to achieve it  recently researchers at the university of massachusettes have discovered what exactly gives geckos their ability to stick to various surfaces and have had success replication it in a new material called geckskin the secret behind geckos’ adhesive properties is what is known as “van der waals” force  geckos’ feet have tiny hairlike structures on them which each have tiny flat ends called “spatulae”  these spatulae give the geckos’ feet a much larger surface area than they would have without them  van der waals force is the attraction that occurs between atoms and molecules  between small objects this force is too minimal to apply however objects with large surface areas have a much greater attraction due to this force  the increased surface area of the geckos’ feet allows them to attract to surfaces and stick  the researchers at the university of massachusettes have successfully been able to replicate this in there design geckskin  this design could become very popular as it can support up to  pounds of weight with a very small square of geckskin  it also leaves behind no residue as current sticky devices would becuase of its application of van der waals force in its design  it works exactly like a gecko’s skin and supports huge amounts of weight relative to its size but it can be removed easily these designers have taken a page out of nature’s book and used biology to aid in their design and production of a new material that could be very popular soon  more research and development is being done with this groundbreaking discovery and with some slight tweaks it could be put into mass production in the near future  the possiblities to stick things together easily and effectively with no other effects or results is very appealling to a number of businesses and consumers and if a glove company picks up the design who knows maybe we’ll see some clothing that allows the wearer to be spidermanlike  whatever the future this material is a very promising design

on safety and rightly so many of the most sought after innovative designs are those which improve the safety of users  people value their safety extremely highly and because of this fact there is incentive for designers to seek the safest form of design despite the extra cost  people are always willing to pay a little extra for guaranteed extra safety  one extremely common aspect of everyday life that can also be life threatening in extreme circumstances is driving a car or other vehicle  in certain weather it can become dangerous to be driving due to road conditions or another aspect sight impairment  imagine when you are driving at night and it starts raining  the rain appears as illuminated drops falling from the sky that can be distracting or impairing to the eye while driving  this has been a problem for drivers until now professor srinivasa narasimhan of carnegie mellon university has been a leading developer of the smart headlight system  it is designed to reduce or eliminate the glare from rain caused by headlights  the system involves a high frequency camera which continuous takes pictures of the falling rain  the system then sends these pictures to a computer which “applies a computer algorithm to predict where each bit of precipitation will be a few milliseconds later”  this prediction system sends a signal to the headlights which automatically turn off the rays from the headlights that would intersect the path of the rain as each drop passes the point of intersectionand turns the rays back on after the drop passes  because the rays turned off at one moment are so small compared to the total rays projected the headlights will not appear to have lost any brightness but the rain will be almost invisible to the driver  the system is  reliable at very low speeds and as the vehicle’s speed increases the system becomes less reliable however it is very reliable up to extreme speeds  this is pretty good considering during rain or snowfall most people will not be driving very fast anyway  this is a very good and effective design that improves safety in vehicles a good deal and may become a common aspect of vehicles for years to come

posted in design interests   comment service design posted on december   by thomas scully                                                    although it is a relatively young field in terms of the existence of it’s formal education service design has always been developed among competing businesses as a way to improve and stand out  you can find it today anywhere someone is trying to make your life easier or anywhere a product is tailored to appeal to specific needs or desires  every company or business applies it in some way or another because they have now come to realize that people will seek and always prefer something that makes them feel comfortable or at home  “the backbone of this process is to understand the behavior of the customers their needs and motivations”  companies now try to cater to the customers’ needs in order to gain their business  the difficulty is in knowing and understanding what customers want before asking them  some people even believe this to be impossible  how can a designer really know what service people will want  in order to better understand how to incorporate service design some designers go “undercover” in a service business and learn by example  they practice and gain firsthand knowledge in how to serve people one company that has been successful in its service design is mcdonald’s in france  at one point in time french citizens had no desire to incorporate mcdonald’s into their lives or eat there at all  they disliked the fast food restaurant’s presence in their country but nowadays the average french customer at mcdonald’s spends  times as much as the average american customer  this change occurred because of mcdonald’s service design which appealled to french interests  the fast food restaurant changed its atmosphere  it modeled itself after starbucks a place frequented by french citizens  starbucks sought to create there locations “designed to provide customers with a third place a place between home and work where they can go to relax or meet with friends”  mcdonald’s adapted this making the place less uniform and more relaxed and open environment to enjoy the company of friends  they no longer appeared to treat customers as the same uniform person but as individuals  this attracted more people and as a result more business in conclusion the ways to design for service are vast and variable but the effects of a good service design are no small matter  many companies pride themselves and thrive on service design  if the customer is the person you are looking to buy your product doesn’t it make sense to design it to serve him  the best designs incorporate this technique in order to make the customer feel at home httpenwikipediaorgwikiservicedesign httpwwwguardiancoukservicedesignservicescience httpdesignforservicewordpresscom posted in design methods   comments beaming technology posted on november   by thomas scully this exciting new technology in the realm of social interaction is still in development process but it could become very important in long distance communication one day  the researchers and developers of this “beaming” technology notice “humans are social animals and paradoxically as telepresence technologies evolve they become more frustrating”  this can be seen commonly in video calls as people understand they are not really with the person whose face they are seeing  the idea behind beaming is that people need a more personal way of interacting across long distances to create the best effect and get the most out of the interaction the technology as anyone can imagine is incredibly advanced and requires even more study and advancement before it can be completely functional  the device used requires the reception and transmition of multiple signals from two locations  in the first location the person wears a transmitor that reads signals given by the person including facial expression motion body language and other functions  in the other location is a robotic avatar or a virtual avatar which receives the signals from the human and acts them out  this second location also receives signals from the surrounding environment and transmit them back to the human on the other side  this allows for a person to understand and react to everything in an environment without even being there  strides have been made and recently there was an experiment done using a small robotic avatar in a cage with a mouse  the person controlling the robot used the signals transmitted to him to follow the mouse’s actions and people on the robot’s side confirmed the successful mimicry this technology still has a long way to go in every aspect but the idea of being able to “be” somewhere else without actually travelling there is appealing to a great deal of people and probably especially business men who need to conduct meetings across countries  we may never reach the beaming capabilities in such science fiction stories as star trek but this new technology is a step towards it and hopefully as step towards better and easier long distance communication

posted on november   by thomas scully the pipistrel taurus g is a remarkable innovation in the world of flying  the plane which is remarkably similar to a glider in several ways can hold  passengers including the two pilots  it is powered entirely by electric power and won the nasacafe green flight challenge the prize for which was  million  although it is small and almost half of the plane’s weight is accounted for by the battery powering the engine the technological opportunity presented by this plane shows that there may be a future in electronic powered aircraft  the plane was able to travel  miles in  hours giving it an average speed of mph the plane itself weighs a little less than  and the battery that powers it weighs just over  pounds  the lithium polymer battery generates  kilowatts which is an output of  horsepower  the physical design of the plane with a wingspan of roughly  feet and two twin fuselages on either side of a central part where the battery is located makes the plane efficient but may not catch on as a guide for future plane designs  the designers note that the taurus g is more of a prototype in the way of electric powered planes and is not likely to ever be on the market  it will however serve as a stepping stone to future developments in electronic air travel and greener air travel httpwwwwiredcomautopiapipistreltaurusgelectric

a revolution in the way we produce various items  it creates an easy and low effort way of creating objects  although the software and setup of the d printer requires a great deal of time work and effort once it is set up it makes the process of creating a part or object extremely simple  although it is still young in its existence d printing is well on its way to immensely changing how we create parts and products d printers operate with the use of a created or scanned cad or computer aided design file  the computer uses this file and sends it to the the printer which then produces the image by laying it out layer by layer  this process will naturally take more or less time depending on how complex the object is and because the object is produced layer by layer it requires the object to have at lest one flat surface  the various types of machines can print using plastics metals and now even printing in concrete is developing  as the process advances and can be applied to a wider range of materials it will become more prevalent and valuable to manufacturers the positives associated with d printing are numerous  one benefit would be how easily it can produce parts and objects  this could prove a huge benefit for manufacturers as the technology develops  they’re parts can be made in whatever shapes they can imagine and all they’ll have to do is send a signal to the printer to create it  researchers at loughborough university in the united kingdom are examining d printing with concrete which could lead to huge advances in what can be printed  the possibilities seem endless some negatives include the fact that right now the majority of d printers only produce very small items but there is a lot of room to expand and develop larger printers  they also can take a long time to print especially with very complicated designs which could lead to slow production of parts  the biggest drawback in the design though may be the impact on personal production  people can buy d printers for their homes and although they are expensive prices are dropping and if people can produce their own products they may consume much less which will hurt the economy  another problem with personal production is what people can produce  one point was made that all someone would need to do to produce a gun is find the design online and download it and that is possible  d printers have produced operational guns which demonstrates that people could produce their own unregistered guns  in reality most people will not do this however the possibility is there which could lead to problems overall if the production and use of d printers is regulated and research continues to yield big results i believe d printing could become a key part of production of goods in the future httpdprintingcomwhatisdprinting httpbitsblogsnytimescomwithadprinterbuildingagunathome httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvefbhdzkphrofeatureplayerdetailpage posted in design topics   comment product life cycles posted on october   by thomas scully we have all seen this happen multiple times during our life and we will continue to see it as long as we live  as long as there are new and innovative ideas and improvements in technology and there always will be a product will always experience the stages of the product life cycle  some products may experience longer time periods of certain stages but all will undoubtedly experience a rise in popularity and sales and then a decline in both  the product life cycle is expected by all designers and although there are multiple views of the product life cycle the overall trend of it is constant one view of the product life cycle include the affectionate view which is the idea that life cycles occure because people always buy what looks sleek and new and what looks the best as designers are always improving the look of their designs  another view is the business view of product life cycles which operates under the idea that marketing and competition will create product life cycles as people desire the newest and best and will replace their old products with the new there are other views as well but what all the views share in common is the idea that the designers are the ones who have the most influence on product life cycles with how they design  they can design with the intention of their product becoming obsolete quickly thus leaving room for them to design new products or they can design with the intention of a lasting design that may grow obsolete on its own or be forced into obselescence by new technologies  the impact of product life cycles have created a great deal of waste and exhaustion of natural resources  the debat has become whether it is better to design sustainably or with the intention of long life rather than designing to be obsolete and make money  ultimately it is in the hands of the designers and the companies but it is a fact that resources are depleting and eventually will run out with increased consumption  whether or not this will lead to increased shortening of product life cycles or lead to designing for longer product life cycles is still uncertain but the consequences of either will have massive effects on the world httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidsitessrcidchnlmvkdxxkzxnpztdghpbmtpbmdzgmjummjimgyztcyjmzg

environmentalsustainable design posted on october   by thomas scully one hot button topic of the last decade has been environmental impact and whether or not we as humans are having a large negative impact on the environment  although it is less prevalent in discussions today many people still see problems such as global warming or the exhaustion of natural resources as the world’s most pressing issues  in order to combat these potential dangers to human existence engineers and designers are now incorporating a great deal more of sustainability in their designs sustainability can be explained as “the philosophy of designing physical objects the built environment and services to comply with the principles of social economic and ecological sustainability ”  it is a key idea in the preservation of natural resources and involves sustaining the existing environment while also creating a new building or whatever else is being designed  involved in sustainable design is the use of more natural energy to reduce energy costs and promote clean energy  many buildings incorporate large glass windows to allow for use of natural light for most of the day or motion sensor lights in rooms to ensure the lights are not left on and the energy wasted  along with this goes the development of solar wind and other renewable energy sources which are very sustainable however as of now they are much more expensive than coal natural gas oil and other current forms of producing energy many buildings are also now incorporating green roofs which allow plant life to thrive on the tops of the buildings thus preserving the natural design of the area while also including new human design  one example of commitment to developing sustainable buildings is at the pennsylvania state university  many of penn state’s newest buildings include green roofs motion sensor lights effective use of glass to reduce artificial light dependency and other environmentally friendly and sustainable features  it is this type of commitment that will improve design sustainability going forward  an example of a design that is not extremely sustainable is the plastic bottle which requires the digging of landfills and is harmful to the environment if left in nature  it can inhibit the growth of the natural plant and animal species of the are  in essence it does not work with the environment but against it although strides have been made in the field of sustainability there are still many more to be made  more companies can become involved and more design fields can involve increased sustainability in their designs  the result will be better use of natural resources and a much better environmental impact by humans httpenwikipediaorgwikisustainabledesign

design posted on october   by thomas scully many designers today are realizing that people do not always necessarily buy the product that does in fact work the most efficiently or have the cheapest price  many consumers purchase products that arouse strong emotional feelings within them  although it is hard to explain why emotions have such power of us as humans it is without question that they do hold this power  for designers to be successful they want to tap into this impulsive factor of consumption and give people an emotional attachment to their products  one example of a powerful emotion in design is nostalgia  those products that make people feel nostalgic and remind them of past glory days and fun times are sold very easily  one examples of important emotions in design are joy and fear  one well said example of how fear controls us is as follows ” imagine a plank  meters long and  meter wide place it on the ground can you walk on it of course – no problem you can jump up and down dance and even walk along with your eyes shut now lift the plank  meters in the air can you walk on it yes although more carefully what if the plank were  meters in the air most of us wouldn’t dare go near it even though the act of walking along it and maintaining balance should be no more difficult than when on the ground why would a simple task suddenly become so difficult – impossible even tell yourself all you want that if you can walk on the plank on the ground you can still walk on it in the air you still won’t walk along it let alone jump and dance or heaven forbid close your eyes while walking fear dominates norman emotion and design” this shows that people will not go near a product they fear even if in another scenario they would be indifferent aesthetics are very important in emtional design  the sight of a nice looking object creates positive feelings toward that object and draws people to that object just as something that looks ugly or unappealing will create negative feelings that cause people to stay away from that product one example of this used in design is in the “bottoms up draft beer dispensing system” found on the site “built to love”  this design creates positive feelings in customers because they enjoy just watching it work and therefore will purchase beer to see it operate  it also creates a more efficient way or filling cups with beer  one of the negatives of this design is it may be more likely to damage the cup and spill the beer and another is once people grow bored with it they will most likely return to the old fashioned pour but for now it is an innovative and effective example of emotional design httpbuilttolovewordpresscom httpwwwjndorgdnmssemotiondesignhtml httpwwwdesignemotioncomthepowerofnostalgiainadvertising posted in design methods   comment safe design posted on october   by thomas scully safe design involves not the elimination of all risk because that is impossible but rather the minimization of potential risks and problems that may arise in a product  it requires a good deal of thought in the design process in order to avoid all major problems that may arise  the law of unitended consequences states “almost all human actions have at least one unintended consequence”  this is certainly true in design as desginers cannot predict everything that will come from their design  alfred nobel had the intention of his invention dynamite being used in construction and excavation  he realized soon that man would develop and use it as a weapon as time went on although it is impossible to find all the possible outcomes or x’s especially the negative ones many of these various outcomes can be predicted and planned for  another thought is that not all unexpected outcomes will be negative  a product could have an unexpected outcome that actually benefits the user or the product itself  also the negative results will not occur very frequently provided adequate time is spent planning for them which it almost always is  in cases where there are drastic negative results product liability comes in to play  product liability protects the customers in the case of poor design or failure to warn about know flaws in design  in many cases the manufacturer is responsible for defects even if they were not known to ensure the customers are always protected  this further ensures focus and time devoted to eliminating as many negative consequences as humanly possible some well known flawed designs include the titanic the challenger space shuttle and the dell computer notebook battery which needed to be recalled due to dangerous consequences  a recall costs a company millions of dollars  so a few extra hours or days to review and improve ceratain aspects of a design seems like a small price to pay in comparison to this cost  these flawed designs resulted in disastrous consequences and will hopefully serve as an example to future designers to examine more aspects  they will most definitely always serve as an example that no design is perfect and there are always consequences  one interesting example of a product which many in the public view as dangerous is hydrogen gas  hydrogen gas is in fact much safer more abundant and cleaner than gasoline and may prove to be a better source of energy  it is not viewed positively because of one event the explosion of the hindenburg which did not even explode because of the hydrogen gas  this shows how fear of danger can prevent even what could be beneficial designs from being created  safety will always and should always be one of the most if not the most important inputs in design httpwwwscribdcomdocnormalaccidenttheoryanddesign httpenwikipediaorgwikiproductliability
