delivered to investors in jp morgan multistrategy fund llc the �msf ric� who held interests in the msf ric as of the close of business on may�  subject to the provisions of paragraph  below �  � please provide an overview of the proposals � � � jp morgan management and the board of directors of the msf ric have proposed i�electing to the msf ric board of directors those  directors who currently oversee the other registered investment companies included within the jp morgan funds complex ii�changing the msf ric�s investment manager from jp morgan alternative asset management inc �jpmaam� to jp morgan investment management inc �jpmim� and iii�adding jp morgan private investments inc �jpmpi� as msf ric�s subadvisor � � � all current directors of the msf ric will cease to serve as directors in the event that the members of record approve the election of the  nominated directors information about the nominated directors� interests in the msf ric are available in the proxy

jp morgan private investments inc � � � � � administrator � pnc global investment services us inc � jp morgan funds management inc � � � � � sub administrator � na � pnc global investment services us inc  � how are the proposals expected to benefit the msf ric and its investors � � � jp morgan management believes that implementing the proposals and having the msf ric become part of the jp morgan funds complex will benefit the msf ric and its members in a number of ways including � i � increasing the msf ric�s branding and distribution efforts in that the msf ric would be included in the jp morgan global wealth management�s �global access� suite of products which currently offers mutual fund and hedge fund products to high net worth investors � � ii � increasing the msf ric�s assets under management through these increased distribution efforts and thereby reducing the msf ric�s annual operating expense ratio as certain fixed costs would be allocated over a larger asset base � � iii � producing operational efficiencies that would result from having the same board members that oversee other jp morgan funds oversee the operations of the msf ric and having jpmim and its affiliates which provide advisory and other services to the other jp morgan funds provide those same services to the msf ric and � � iv � giving the msf ric access to jpmpi�s significant hedge fund expertise  � who are the officers of jpmpi � � � the officers of jpmpi are members of the private bank�s global access portfolios team or the alternative investments group specifics of the officers of

the investments of the msf ric  � did jp morgan consider creating a new fund registered under the  act �ric� in global access and have existing members of msf ric redeem their interests and invest in the new vehicle � � � jp morgan considered a number of alternatives to achieve the benefits described above including jp morgan creating a new ric in global access jp morgan determined that creating a new ric and requiring existing members of msf ric to redeem and reinvest in the new vehicle was not in the best interests of the members and did not recommend that alternative to the board such transaction if implemented would potentially adversely affect existing members high water marks cause members adverse tax consequences and require holdbacks in the redemption process members of msf ric should not experience these adverse consequences under the current proposals set out by the msf ric and described above procedure  � what is generally required to implement these changes � � � the current board of directors of the msf ric needed to approve the proposals and authorize the preparation and mailing of a proxy statement to the members of the msf ric completed � june� � � � � a preliminary proxy statement filing was made with the sec describing the proposals completed � june�  � � � � a definitive proxy statement filing was made with the sec and prepared to be delivered to members of record completed � july�  � � � � a vote by members of record as of may�  to approve the proposals member meeting scheduled for august�   � what are the next steps � � � for discretionary and singletrustee accounts for accounts where jp morgan has sole investment discretion there are potential conflicts of interest issues as it relates to voting on a proposal involving affiliates of jp morgan therefore for these accounts jp morgan has retained the services of iss an independent proxy voting service for voting on these proposals on behalf of these accounts and proxy statements for these investors will be delivered to iss accordingly � � � � for brokerage and �cotrustee� accounts for selfdirected accounts or fiduciary accounts where there is an additional nonjp morgan trustee with investment discretion these accounts will receive the proxy statement the proxy statement contains information related to the proposals revised agreements and a form to vote on these proposals once received signatories are requested to sign and return the voting form as soon as possible and prior to the meeting scheduled for august�th  � when is the proxy statement expected to be mailed to members � � � proxy packages are expected to be mailed to members on july�  �  � when are the changes expected to be implemented � � � if members approve the proposals on or before august�  the new investment manager jpmim�and subadvisor jpmpi�are expected to assume responsibilities for managing the msf ric portfolio of underlying funds on or about august�  in addition the  new directors will assume their duties on or about august�   �  � members of record are urged to read the proxy statement before voting on the proposals because it will contain important information members of record
