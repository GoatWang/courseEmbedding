with thomas e faust jr of eaton vance corp with thomas e faust jr of eaton vance corp mar     am by frederick p gabriel jr  zoom thomas e faust jr soon will be wearing driving gloves to work at eaton vance corpas the mandatory retirement of chief executive james b hawkes approaches mr faust  is preparing to become his successor in january mr faust who has been serving as eaton vances chief investment officer for the past six years also was named president of the bostonbased fund company mr hawkes must retire in late  in accordance with the companys mandatoryretirement policy duncan w richardson  the firms chief equity investment officer meanwhile was named executive vice presidentthose close to eaton vance say mr fausts ascension hardly is a surprise for years they say mr faust who joined the company in  as an equity analyst has worked closely with mr hawkes among the goals he would like to accomplish when he takes over is the further diversification of eaton vances product baseunder mr hawkes eaton vance has distinguished itself  and gained assets  by focusing on moreobscure parts of the market such as municipal bonds taxmanaged funds and bankloan funds now it is time to focus on plain vanilla offerings such as building out the firms capabilities in valueoriented investing mr faust saidon the growth side an acquisition could be in eaton vances future he added no matter what it wont be easyits going to take them some time said geoff bobroff a fund consultant in east greenwich ri i mean there are some very good value and growth shops out there he said im not exactly sure how eaton vance will distinguish itselfq how much of this promotion is a surprisea its not much of a surprise i have been executive vice president which is the title eaton vance has used for the no  person for a long timeq will this be a harbinger of other management changesaover the period between now and october of next year duncan richardson and i will be working with jim hawkes on some succession issues there are other members of senior management who are of similar vintage who will be retiring over the next couple of yearsq will you and mr richardson bring people in from the outside to assume top management positions at eaton vancea i dont think so there are some openings that will be created by a couple of other people that are approaching retirement there are also openings created by duncan and me moving into new areas of responsibility but no this is not intended as a house cleaning or a shuffle of the deckq so is there an area of the market where eaton vance is underrepresenteda one of those areas is the institutional market that is an area we didnt really talk about until a year ago when we started a major initiative that is now just hitting its stride over the next decade or even two decades we expect a much closer balance between retail and institutionalq why nowawe preach diversification as an investment discipline we tell investors its a way to enhance riskadjusted returns we think that way about our own business we want to be diversified across investment capabilitiesq where do financial advisers fit into your plansa well  of our current business is through financial advisers if we had been having this conversation six or eight years ago wed be debating whether that number goes up or down its pretty much been decided that the financial world is too complicated a place for most people to do it on their own we believe advisers will be our primary access point for individual investors for years and years to comeq are there any efforts under way to court advisers differentlya the retailsales environment is changing and moving toward an institutional model with morecentralized evaluation and screening and approval of products we generally think it makes sense for there to be a centralized group at most distribution companies that vets different products and styles so as a result weve increased our resources devoted to that channelq so what does that meana keyaccount managers are the people that interface with these teams so rather than having an army of wholesalers who call on individual advisers weve got a team of people calling on headquarters of different brokerdealer firms talking about products and trying to get our funds included in various productsq are you aiming primarily at wirehouses or are you also going after regional brokersa were aiming for pretty broad penetration in both areas q how are you hoping to bring diversification to the investment side of the business a on the equity side one area for more diversification would be largecap valueq but eaton vance has had products in this area for a long time why do you think that that product is being underutilized by advisersa our two largecapvalue funds have about  billion in assets in total while that is not chicken feed its certainly not on the same scale of someone like american funds q agreed but why isnt it bigger a some of it is that it hasnt been an area of marketing focus for us we had our hands full in the early s being the king of municipal bond funds in the late s we had our hands full with being the king of taxmanaged investing and bankfund investingq why not stay with niche products a if you start from a base of  billion its harder to grow by being a niche company one of the things about largecap value is that its not a niche its a mainstream category where if we do well and continue to serve the interest of clients we can add another zero or more to that  billion that we are managing in the fund businessq do you have any plans to expand into more alternative products such as hedge fundsa weve looked at them but so far we have not been tempted to go that way as a retail product funds of hedge funds have some challenges the biggest one being layers of fees that make it hard to add valueq what are your thoughts about the future of the mutual fund industrya the fund industry remains a very attractive place to be the demographics of baby boomers saving for retirement still remain a positive factor overall i think the wind remains at the back of the mutual fund industry q what are your views about whats happening in the stock market these days a i feel pretty good about the stock market weve gone through a period where year after year weve talked about how stocks are overvalued but what weve seen over the last four years of aboveaverage earnings growth and relatively modest equity market returns is that valuations have come in a fair bit q do you have any concerns about the economya we might see a little bit of a slowing this year but nothing to get concerned about i mean weve seen a number of increases of shortterm interest rates and very often that is a precursor to a slowing in the economy it hasnt happened yet but its something to watch carefullyqare you making any changes to eaton vances overall investment strategya on the equity side we have been thinking that the market is moving to a neutral point where growth and value ought to be performing more comparably q what about the fixedincome sidea were still keeping the durations relatively short we scratch our heads a little bit when we look at the inflation numbers and commodities prices how do you justify long bonds where they are so we are still cautious there but at some point we will probably lose that caution q are there any acquisitions on eaton vances horizona one area where we have talked about possibly making some acquisitions to broaden our capability is actually in the largecapgrowth space we have some largecapgrowth product through an affiliate in atlanta but its a large and important area and we would be open to adding some additional capabilities  comments what do you think
