issue published november   doi httpsdoiorg anders gustafssonkarlstad university michael d johnsonuniversity of michigan abstract references cited by pdf abstractdetermining the importance that customers place on the product and service attributes that drive their satisfaction with and loyalty to service providers is an essential part of a firm’s resource allocation process an unsettled issue is whether importance measures should come directly from customers or be derived statistically and if so how the authors compare direct importance ratings with a variety of methods for statistically deriving attribute importance in a customer satisfaction model using three data sets the methods are compared on criteria that include their ability to explain variation in satisfaction to identify customers’more important attributes and to be interpretable the findings suggest that because each of the tested methods has its strengths and weaknesses it is essential to choose a method
