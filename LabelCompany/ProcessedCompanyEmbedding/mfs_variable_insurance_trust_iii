portfolio expenses and other factors can be expected to affect performance important risk considerations the portfolio may not achieve its objective andor you could lose money on your investment in the portfolio investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price the price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments however an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity investments in foreign markets can involve greater risk and volatility than us investments because of adverse market currency economic industry political regulatory geopolitical or other conditions investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk please see the
