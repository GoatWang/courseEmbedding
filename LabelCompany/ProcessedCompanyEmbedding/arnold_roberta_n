      february         the practice of wisdom      a contribution to clinical philosophy       by arnold bernstein phd                                           philosophy n  the rational investigationof the truths and principles of being knowledgeor conduct  the pursuit of wisdom            we may insist as often as we like that mans intellect is powerless in comparison with his instinctual life and we may be right in this nevertheless there is something peculiar about this weakness  the voice of the intellect is a soft one but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing  finally after a countless succession of rebuffs it succeeds  sigmund freud       without a philosophy a psychotherapist is like a navigator without a map or a destination  this paper offers such a philosophical approach to some of the issues surrounding the nature and future of psychoanalysis  it proposes a philosophy broad enough in its purview to shift the emphasis of psychoanalysis from its present focus on the pathological to that of the normal psychoanalysis encompasses far more than merely a technique of psychotherapy  it is an exotic mix of art science and intuition  though it endeavors to be scientific in its theoretical constructs it is a performing art in its practices  even the most cursory examination of the titles of freud’s publications will reveal the sweep of his interests  besides psychopathology and psychotherapy freud applied the psychoanalytic method to the analysis of dreams sexuality human development character and personality everyday life wit and humor the family the human condition biography history religion cultural anthropology civilization folklore and countless other topics  indeed as i hope to show freud was hardly just a psychoanalyst but he was in addition what i will identify as a clinical philosopher strictly speaking the psychoanalytic method or what is usually called psychoanalyzing consists of interpreting   interpreting is a form of thinking that involves the translation of the symbolic or unconscious meanings of words and deeds into conscious thoughts  such interpretations or thoughts can then be written or spoken or simply allowed to remain the silent basis of the actions used in the service of psychotherapy   proficiency in the art of interpretation is the hallmark of a psychoanalyst today we shall be talking about the formulation of a new discipline which could be called clinical philosophy   clinical philosophy would be an amalgam of psychoanalysis which would remain as its core augmented by the applicable findings from other related fields mainly psychotherapy psychology and philosophy since its beginnings in the last century the theory and practice of psychoanalysis has undergone many changes  at the same time it has had to resist certain other changes in order to preserve its identity  from a specialized treatment of the symptoms of psychoneuroses which were at that time thought to be diseases of the nervous system it has gradually grown into a general theory of the mind that is applicable to understanding the whole range of human emotions and psychic misery  this is what freud meant when he predicted that the future will probably attribute far greater importance to psychoanalysis as the science of the unconscious than as a therapeutic procedure my hope today is to stimulate some new thoughts about psychoanalysis by looking at some old ideas and placing them in a new context  in each instance although the words and ideas used by me will be familiar i hope that by reframing them in a larger context they will acquire fresh meanings   for example take the word soul  by a soul i will simply mean a person  as in the expression  “she is a good soul“   but also notice the implications of emphasizing that she is a good soul as contrasted to saying that she has a good soul  she is then seen as the person that she is rather than as the body that she has  hence the expression “body and soul”  we will return to the subject of the soul later and now we must address another familiar concept that of resistance  first the concept of resistance in general and then later the particular kind of resistance shown by analysts that though very common goes largely unnoticed i feel obliged to do this because i intend to introduce a different way of looking at things  and the general resistance to which i refer is the one that occurs almost universally when any new or different idea is introduced or a change is suggested in the accepted way of doing things  it is the resistance to changing one’s mind it was this resistance that greeted freud when he first introduced psychoanalysis to the world and it is this resistance that continues to be mobilized almost every time a new innovation in psychoanalytic theory or practice is suggested  max planck the great physicist once remarked not totally with tongue in cheek that we never succeed in convincing our contemporaries  we just have to outlive them but there really isn’t anything so surprising about this because resistancetochange is a universal phenomenon  it is evident not only in the world of ideas but in the physical world as well according to physicists inertia is a fundamental property of all matter inertia is defined as the resistance that a body presents to a change in its speed or position upon the application of a force or the opposition that an object or a substance presents to passage through it   so resistance is in the very nature of being   something in the sensory world is known to “exist” only when it resists consequently resistance is a fundamental property of existence  if something doesn’t resist it isn’t there  in the psychological sphere identity and character are sources of such resistances in biology resistance refers to the selfpreservative mechanisms of living creatures by which they defend themselves against disease  or the capacity of tissues to withstand the effects of harmful environmental agents  in politics resistance refers to the forces that oppose oppression   in a general sense a resistance is any defense of the status quo   it is any opposition to change   and it can be either passive or aggressive but inertia force and resistance have psychological meanings as well  thus the term resistance can be used to describe any force physical or psychological that opposes or retards motion or change  in psychology and psychoanalysis the forces that are at work are described as ideas and urges impulses and drives  we can speak of the force of ideas and the power of words and the sexual drive and their resistance to changing in psychoanalytic treatment as in any human interaction resistance usually refers to behavior emotion or thought that interferes with progressive communication   resistance leads to inhibition of words thoughts and ideas and can be an impediment to progress in science as well as in treatment freud long ago identified the compulsion to repeat also known as the repetitioncompulsion resistance as an “expression of the inertia inherent in organic life” which he called thanatos  this led to the paradox that repetition is a resistance that is to say a form of staying the same  what lewis carroll described as “running fast to stay in the same place” death the return to the inorganic state becoming the ultimate repetition in which there is no change  life resists death  and death resists life  things in motion tend to remain in motion and things at rest tend to remain at rest one of the least noticed and most common countertransference resistances is a therapist’s over commitment to a particular theory or method of treatment or a particular belief system  an over zealous commitment to a particular theoretical point of view acts as a resistance to considering any other point of view either from colleagues or patients   freud remarked that whoever is familiar with the nature of neurosis will not be astonished to learn that even someone who is very well able to carry out analysis upon others can behave like any other mortal and be capable of producing violent resistances as soon as he himself becomes the object of analytic lnvestlgation” these resistances get in the way of analytic progress in and out of treatment  but how does one overcome the resistance presented by what someone believes  how does one change a belief any belief  the answer proposed by psychoanalysis is that one must first address and resolve the resistance before a new thought can emerge   and resolving resistances to progressive changes in thought patterns is what the psychoanalytic enterprise is all about obviously an existing belief system presents an impediment to the acceptance of new ideas i believe that psychoanalysis will thrive as a profession separate from medicine during the next century only if it can again offer the world a new way of thinking about human beings  offering the world a new way of thinking was after all freud’s great and ultimate contribution to the history of culture  to do this psychoanalysts will need to shake loose from their fascination with the nineteenth century paradigm of mental illness that continues to bedevil their thinking and practices   what we need is a new philosophy or as it turns out to improve upon an ancient one  the notion that mental illness is the product of biological dysfunction leaves them helpless to prevail in the face of the discovery and widespread use of psychotropic medication during the present century but important and admirable as these advances in psychopharmacology may be they cast no light upon how human beings can live better and happier lives without drugs and how they can avoid feeling miserable in the first place besides only the tiniest fraction of human madness and misery emanates from diseases of the brain and nervous system  moreover on balance it must be admitted that psychotropic drugs administered either with or without a physician’s prescription have probably damaged at least as many lives as they have improved witness also the world wide hidden as well as not so hidden social and psychological costs and ravages of chemical substance abuse  since so many varieties of human suffering cannot be attributed to disorders of the body any endeavor to understand human psychological suffering solely in terms of brain neurophysiology and which attempts to remedy it solely through medical means is bound to fail  both chemotherapy and psychotherapy have their places in the scheme of things but the role they will continue to play depends largely upon what therapists and the profession believes about the nature of mental illness  this situates the mindbody issue at the very core of the present philosophical revolution that is unfolding in the field of mental health  and this reintroduces the distinction between body and soul soma and psyche the organism and the person  perforce we have to discriminate between two different universes of discourse that of the brain and that of the mind  the words used to describe the mind are different from those used to describe the brain  and the events to which they allude are different phenomena it is unfortunate that sigmund freud’s translators had a resistance to the word soul because instead of translating the german word seele into the english word soul which it means in german they translated it as psyche which means soul or mind in greek  but in fact freud had referred to psychoanalysis as soul psychology “indeed” freud wrote “the word seelesorge might well serve as a general formula for describing the function which the analyst has to perform in relation to the public”  the german word sorgen means one who cares for   so freud had in mind that a psychoanalyst is a seelesorge someone who cares for the soul to the extent possible james strachey avoided the use of the word soul in his translations of freud and in this instance elected to translate the german word seelesorge into english as “secular pastoral counselor”  a designation comparable to our own term “clinical philosopher”   since translation is a form of interpretation to the extent that strachey mistranslated freud he misinterpreted him interpretation is at the very heart of classical psychoanalysis  classical psychoanalysis was a method for discovering unconscious meanings in the service of attaining insight and understanding  in that sense it was a research tool an interpreter is a translator and this is what psychoanalysts have traditionally been  they translated dreams   they translated the unconscious into the conscious  but modern psychoanalysis as you know has pretty much abandoned interpretation as its tool  what used to be the goal of classical psychoanalysis which was the understanding of unconscious meanings has now become the means employed by modern analysts to attain the goal of resolving resistances  the goal of modern analysis is not to translate the unconscious into the conscious so much as to relieve suffering the objective of all forms of psychotherapy is to relieve suffering   the future of modern analysis lies with helping people to find happiness  it has gradually moved from using interpretations of the unconscious for the purpose of curing diseases to a human enterprise with the purpose of increasing happiness so what freud really thought was that unlike physicians who are curing bodies psychoanalysts were curing souls thats the message that lies buried in our mostly forgotten past  and our message for today is that in our past lies our future  in the st century we may finally remember what psychoanalysis is all about but it must also be remembered that freud was a scientist and an atheist  so he was not talking about the soul in a religious sense  nor are we talking about the soul in a mystical sense  were talking about the soul as the quintessentially human the human being ie the person as contrasted to the organism  that part of the individual that we experience verbally when we ask an analysand to lie down on the couch break eye contact and to say everything no one has written more eloquently than thomas szasz has about the malignant consequences that follow from the failure of professionals and society to appreciate the philosophical implications embedded in matters pertaining to mental” health  particularly unfortunate are the consequences that follow from confusing socalled mental illnesses with organic disturbances of the brain and nervous system and in incorporating their treatment under the rubric of medicine without appreciating the philosophical and social implications of doing so szasz submits the following fundamental philosophical proposition  disease means and should only mean a disorder of the body  and accordingly his argument goes medical treatment means and should only mean a physicochemical intervention in the structure and function of the body within the framework of this formulation most forms of socalled “mental” illness and their treatment would strictly speaking properly fall outside of the province of medical science  as would also the mental suffering normally propagated by the tragic vicissitudes of everyday life  this does not preclude recognizing that some psychic suffering can be alleviated through medical means ie medication or that on occasion some physically induced suffering can be relieved through psychological means ie psychotherapy  the psychosomatic continuum is a two way street that can be entered at either end it is easy to confuse means and ends here  medical means can sometimes be used to attain psychological ends just as psychological means may sometimes be employed to achieve physical ends  there is a compelling need for the consistent use of more precise definitions in fields like psychiatry psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in which ambiguities glib formulations unsupported speculations and especially the careless use of undefined terms is so common it is misleading szasz says to think of the actual practice of psychotherapy as if it were a form of medical treatment  indeed he says it should be regarded as a form of the special branch of philosophy that aristotle called rhetoric persuasive speech rather than as a branch of medicine since the practice of psychotherapy usually is implemented mainly in the form of an exchange of words and feelings between persons as a practice it clearly has more in common with a platonic dialogue than a medical treatment  and in fact until the philosopher william james wrote his precedent setting textbook principles of psychology the whole field of psychology was itself a branch of philosophy and was taught as such in university departments of philosophy philosophers from the time of plato have sought to provide their students with general guidelines to help them in their search for increased inner peace and happiness in this world through personal enlightenment raised and expanded consciousness love and understanding  and in preparation for the next world through a belief in gods and in the fantasy of other lives after death so it seems that what we have been calling psychotherapy is really a new edition of an old discipline which can now more properly be identified as clinical philosophy clinical philosophy or psychotherapy can be defined as “the therapeutic practice of wisdom”  the application of philosophy to the relief of human suffering  it would consist of the development and the application of a general theory of the treatment and cure of persons souls human beings as contrasted to clinical medicine which concerns the treatment and cure of bodies the objective of formulating such a philosophy of psychotherapy would be to provide practitioners of the various schools of psychotherapy with a common framework within which they could implement their own particular methods of relieving psychogenic human suffering from a purely philosophical point of view what is needed is some kind of lingua franca a sort of grammar of general treatment principles consisting of common definitions sufficiently operational so that psychoanalysts and psychotherapists of diverse schools could at least agree as to what it was that they were talking about  because there is actually a considerable body of agreement among mental health professionals of different schools of thought that is concealed by their differences in terminology  the actual practices of experienced therapists of different schools do not differ as much as their vocabulary might suggest          a clinical philosopher would be a special kind of a teacher doctor who might also be qualified as a physician a psychologist a pastor a nurse a social worker a philosopher or be trained in any of the humanities or social sciences  many synonyms and modes of address for such teachers readily come to mind professor master as zen master doctor from latin for teacher rabbi hebrew for teacher guru hindi for teacher counselor healer mentor spiritual guide or psychotherapist and therapist from classical greek for helper facilitator from gestalt therapy and psychoanalyst  it is perhaps somewhat unfortunate that in the united states the medical profession has preempted the title of doctor  and though its original meaning teacher is still preserved in academic circles it is more often than not used as if it were a synonym for physician for which it is popularly substituted ideally such teachers would be highly evolved human beings with a broad background in the liberal arts and sciences as well as having had specialized training in one or more of the various methods and techniques of interpersonal influence  they would hopefully have sought and undergone a personal psychotherapeutic experience and they would also be knowledgeable concerning theories of human development especially psychoanalysis and to have mastered the art of applying these in clinical situations  these doctors teachers might also continue to refer to their students as patients but by this they would mean “persons who are suffering” i prefer the adoption of the appellation clinical philosopher to that of clinical psychologist or psychoanalyst because it would not only demystify the true nature of psychotherapy but would liberate practicing professionals from the strangling network of licensing laws and state regulations that have frozen our field in a procrustean tangle of antique paradigms to satisfy insurance companies and self serving professional interests so our future lies in our past you may recall that freud compared psychoanalysis to archaeology  an archaeologist he said digs to find artifacts from the past in order to reconstruct the past from these artifacts   but its very clear that the archaeologist is not digging in the past  the archaeologist is digging in the present  the artifacts that he uncovers exist in the present   he reconstructs the past in the present from artifacts that he has in the present  very much the way a psychoanalyst is searching in the present for memories and associations from which to reconstruct the past  the “past” is in the present but how does one look into the future  in a sense the future is not a place but merely an idea of a place  when an astronomer peers into outer space is she looking at the future or looking at the past  well the astronomer thinks shes looking at the past  but when a space ship is launched into outer space is its destination in the past or in the future  what then is the future  what then is the present  what then is the past  past present and future become extraordinarily complicated ideas one metaphor about life is that living life can be compared to rowing a boat  we are backing into the future   and thats a way of describing what were doing here today  were backing into the future   in the sense that we are viewing the past in the present and extrapolating into the future  moreover the future we refer to is not a place  its an idea  the future is an idea in the same sense that the past is an idea  a memory is an idea about the past  but a memory is not itself a past event  a memory is a current event taking place in the brain now  its a present idea about the past  there is a link between our memory of the past which is in the present and our fantasy of the future which is also in the present  how else can we get to the future except from our present position rowing into the future so to speak backing into the future by looking at the past  arnold bernstein phd    from roberta russelli offer my gratitude to my friend arnold
