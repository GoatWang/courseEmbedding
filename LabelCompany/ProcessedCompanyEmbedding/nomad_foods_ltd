portfolio strategysummarynomad foods filed for an ipo with an offer amount over  billiontheir product lines have established strong brand recognition in the uk germany and italythey have made some heavy acquisitions recently to expand their product line and footprinta leader in distributing and manufacturing branded frozen foods in weston europe nomad foods otcpknomhf has a  market share in the united kingdom germany and italy in these countries nomad foods is sold through grocery retailers under the brands birds eye iglo and findus some of their competitors include dr oetker mccain and nestlé source nomad foods f some notes on the company and ipo they are a big player in the united kingdom germany and italy nomad foods brands are household names a  market research study showed that spontaneous brand awareness for nomad foods products in those three countries were   and  there is still plenty of room for growth as big as the company is there is still significant growth opportunities for nomad foods strategic acquisitions will help the company grow into newer geographic markets while expanding outside of just the frozen food category will help them capture a bigger piece of the sector source nomad foods f they are not profitable for the year  nomad foods had an operating margin of  but ending up taking a loss of € million if you take a look throughout all their years you will see a positive operating margin and a negative net margin due to their net finance costs which are made up of a considerable amount of capitalized interest but they do have cash nomad foods should not have any problems meeting their shortterm obligation especially considering their cash and cash equivalents exceeded their total current liabilities ending september  there is some longterm debt on the books which is cutting into them turning a positive net margin however they are well positioned enough to pay down that debt to a more manageable level source nomad foods f theyre all about acquisitions nomad foods is built on acquisitions and that is not a game they want to slow down on after completing the acquisition of iglo foods for € billion in june the company wasted no time in picking up findus sverige ab for £ million last month it is likely we will see more acquisitions in the future funded by combinations of cash debt and equity this isnt there first time on the public markets this ipo is just a move to the nyse currently they trade otc under otcpknomhf and on the london stock exchange under nhl with a market cap of over  billion while the stock is up since its ipo in april of  it has been tumbled down almost  since july conclusion i am not sure how much of a stir this ipo will make on the nyse its a rather unknown company in north america and frozen foods might not motivate the investor base nomad foods seems to be ambitious in their acquisition strategy but that always raises concerns especially when moving into newer markets facing different
