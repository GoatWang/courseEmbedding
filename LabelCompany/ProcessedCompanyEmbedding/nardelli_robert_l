nardelli was recruited by home depot—the worlds largest homeimprovement retailer—as ceo and later chairman he overhauled the companys decentralized management structure and replaced its freewheeling robert l nardelli apworld wide photos  entrepreneurial culture and its exuberant—some would say rowdy—atmosphere with six sigma managerial procedures utilizing ges classic business strategies nardelli in stalled processes and systems streamlined operations moved into new markets and grew home depot through acquisitions robert louis nardelli was born on may   in old forge pennsylvania his parents who had grown up during the depression instilled in him a strong work ethic his father had started at ge as an hourly worker and rose to plant manager his mother kept the home for the two children and worked as a real estate agent nardelli was a mediocre student but a star athlete altar boy boy scout class officer yearbook editor and rotc cadet he earned a football scholarship to western illinois university and worked summers paving high ways nardelli was built too small to fulfill his dream of becoming a professional football player and rejected a coachs career as too unpredictable he joined ge as an entrylevel manufacturing engineer—its lowest salaried position at night he worked on his mba at the university of louisville ambition was to head ge by the late s nardelli was asking ceo jack welch to analyze his job performance in  after nardelli had risen to a manufacturing vice presidency he asked welch for a general management job welch refused and nardelli quit when welch tried to talk him into coming back nardelli made it clear that his ambition was eventually to become ceo of ge instead nardelli became an executive vice president of the case corporation an industrialequipment manufacturer in racine wisconsin he headed the companys worldwide parts and components division and was promoted to general manager of case construction equipment its global business nardelli returned to ge in  as chief executive of camco ges canadian appliance manufacturing company based in toronto the following year he became president and ceo of ge transportation systems in erie pennsylvania there he oversaw the change in basic technology from ac to dc doubled the size of the division and took it global he modernized product lines expanded services pacified angry unions and more than doubled the divisions profits in  nardelli was named a ge senior vice president and head of ge power systems in schenectady new york the hundredyearold manufacturer of gas and steam turbines and generators was in deep trouble the division was considered an old economy backwater with almost no potential for growth its regional workforce had shrunk from  in the mids to only  with another  employees worldwide the divisions deserted factories were scattered throughout an alienated community overhauled ge power systems to cope with energyindustry cycles and government turmoil around the world nardelli broadened the companys base he took advantage of opportunities created by industry deregulation and increased power demands he turned outdated manufacturing facilities into hightech service centers for global customers nardelli helped formulate a strategy called the metamarket view to develop different ways for the company to serve a single customer nardelli reinvested in the core products of ge power systems extended its product line and acquired more than  energyrelated businesses he shifted from selling products to selling services including longterm contracts to operate facilities in  nardelli instituted six sigma quality improvement training at ge power systems pioneered at ge six sigma aimed for the statistical nearperfect variation of  defects per million it was a business process that relied on data rather than individual opinion six sigma companies analyzed their processes to discover where defects could occur measured those defects and attempted to eliminate them ge power systems became one of ges most profitable divisions and one of the biggest success stories in the companys history in five years nardelli increased profits almost sevenfold with half of the divisions revenue coming from new products in addition nardelli repaired relationships with employees and the local community old factories were transformed into ball fields and green space he initiated annual worker training and continuing education passed over for ceo in an intense threeway competition to become ceo of ge welch chose jeffrey immelt nardelli was devastated at ge he was known as little jack he had worked extraordinarily hard and welch had put him through many difficult tests in june  he told patricia sellers of fortune  there was always this rap against me about being functionally proficient but not very strategic nardelli also had a reputation for being somewhat inarticulate nardelli had promised welch that he would not talk to other companies until welch had made his decision within minutes of the announcement nardelli was offered the presidency of home depot he demanded the ceos job the home depot board was convinced that the company needed a sophisticated leader from the outside in december  after  years at ge nardelli moved to atlanta with a compensation package amounting to  million in  although home depot cofounders bernie marcus and arthur blank continued on as cochairmen nardelli and the board soon asked blank to leave and marcus later retired marcus and blank had a simple business strategy continuous expansion in  years they had grown home depot from a single warehouse store to a store giant with  billion in annual sales but costs were out of control samestore stores open for at least a year sales were flat profit growth had slowed and the share price had dropped lowes home depots major competitor was doing far better brought six sigma to home depot after the announcement that home depot had hired a ceo with no retail experience nardelli tried to squelch concerns in january  he told fortune that his personal management style fit in with home depots corporate culture and that of all the companies he had looked at home depot most mirrored the way i like to operate in answer to a question about imposing gestyle management on home depot nardelli replied that to move from one social architecture and operating system and assume its  portable and the platform of understanding is there at the new place—thats a terrible mistake in response to a question about ge executives who were unsuccessful as outside ceos nardelli told patricia sellers in a march  fortune story that those executives didnt realize they were in a different environment they did not have the respect of the culture and werent sensitive to the pride of the employees nevertheless most of the  home depot employees had never heard of bob nardelli and some company veterans were openly hostile his first day on the job nardelli was astonished to discover that home depot lacked the infrastructure to send a companywide email its stores did not have automated inventory systems shipments were logged with clipboard and pencil home depot stores were rundown and had a reputation for poor customer service nardelli believed that better processes led to better quality and higher profits he increased information technology spending by  percent in  he spent  million on inventory shipping and tracking systems he substituted  different employee evaluation forms with two salaried personnel from the ceo down were to be rated by coworkers above and beneath them and salaries were based on the scores at a time when home depot was planning to hire about  new employees nardelli did not necessarily fire those with poor scores he first sought the advice of others and told underperformers exactly what they were doing wrong nardelli created a leadership institute modeled on ges to groom highpotential managers teaching them all aspects of merchandizing management and of course six sigma although home depot had tried to implement six sigma earlier it rarely had been used for retail businesses restructured the company although efficiency had never been a big priority at home depot it was nardellis operating principle the company had outgrown its laissezfaire doityourself management style nardelli replaced home depots decentralized structure of local store managers with a technologically sophisticated command center in his first six weeks he eliminated an entire management layer he combined divisions and reassigned or eliminated group presidents with all us division presidents reporting directly to him of the  senior managers  left and were replaced by managers—many of whom came from ge—with no retail experience in january  nardelli told institutional investor weve gone from  separate businesses under one banner to one brand with  stores we went from nine buying offices to one centralized management meant better supplier prices and increased margins orders were routed from central purchasing in atlanta through transfer centers to stores local suppliers were squeezed out and nardelli began buying out wholesalers however the new shipping systems required lower inventories leaving some stores sold out of popular merchandise such as electronics cutting inventories while pushing managers to move products resulted in fewer reorders home depots regional managers used to cutting their own deals with suppliers resisted their loss of control many opted out and took early retirement analysts began worrying that the company was changing too fast nardelli was criticized for dismantling the decentralized structure before investing in the information technology required for centralized management however between

ferry road atlanta georgia  httpwwwhomedepotcom ■ after losing the competition to become ceo of general electric ge robert nardelli was recruited by home depot—the worlds largest homeimprovement retailer—as ceo and later chairman he overhauled the companys decentralized management structure and replaced its freewheeling robert l nardelli apworld wide photos  entrepreneurial culture and its exuberant—some would say rowdy—atmosphere with six sigma managerial procedures utilizing ges classic business strategies nardelli in stalled processes and systems streamlined operations moved into new markets and grew home depot through acquisitions robert louis nardelli was born on may   in old forge pennsylvania his parents who had grown up during the depression instilled in him a strong work ethic his father had started at ge as an hourly worker and rose to plant manager his mother kept the home for the two children and worked as a real estate agent nardelli was a mediocre student but a star athlete altar boy boy scout class officer yearbook editor and rotc cadet he earned a football scholarship to western illinois university and worked summers paving high ways nardelli was built too small to fulfill his dream of becoming a professional football player and rejected a coachs career as too unpredictable he joined ge as an entrylevel manufacturing engineer—its lowest salaried position at night he worked on his mba at the university of louisville ambition was to head ge by the late s nardelli was asking ceo jack welch to analyze his job performance in  after nardelli had risen to a manufacturing vice presidency he asked welch for a general management job welch refused and nardelli quit when welch tried to talk him into coming back nardelli made it clear that his ambition was eventually to become ceo of ge instead nardelli became an executive vice president of the case corporation an industrialequipment manufacturer in racine wisconsin he headed the companys worldwide parts and components division and was promoted to general manager of case construction equipment its global business nardelli returned to ge in  as chief executive of camco ges canadian appliance manufacturing company based in toronto the following year he became president and ceo of ge transportation systems in erie pennsylvania there he oversaw the change in basic technology from ac to dc doubled the size of the division and took it global he modernized product lines expanded services pacified angry unions and more than doubled the divisions profits in  nardelli was named a ge senior vice president and head of ge power systems in schenectady new york the hundredyearold manufacturer of gas and steam turbines and generators was in deep trouble the division was considered an old economy backwater with almost no potential for growth its regional workforce had shrunk from  in the mids to only  with another  employees worldwide the divisions deserted factories were scattered throughout an alienated community overhauled ge power systems to cope with energyindustry cycles and government turmoil around the world nardelli broadened the companys base he took advantage of opportunities created by industry deregulation and increased power demands he turned outdated manufacturing facilities into hightech service centers for global customers nardelli helped formulate a strategy called the metamarket view to develop different ways for the company to serve a single customer nardelli reinvested in the core products of ge power systems extended its product line and acquired more than  energyrelated businesses he shifted from selling products to selling services including longterm contracts to operate facilities in  nardelli instituted six sigma quality improvement training at ge power systems pioneered at ge six sigma aimed for the statistical nearperfect variation of  defects per million it was a business process that relied on data rather than individual opinion six sigma companies analyzed their processes to discover where defects could occur measured those defects and attempted to eliminate them ge power systems became one of ges most profitable divisions and one of the biggest success stories in the companys history in five years nardelli increased profits almost sevenfold with half of the divisions revenue coming from new products in addition nardelli repaired relationships with employees and the local community old factories were transformed into ball fields and green space he initiated annual worker training and continuing education passed over for ceo in an intense threeway competition to become ceo of ge welch chose jeffrey immelt nardelli was devastated at ge he was known as little jack he had worked extraordinarily hard and welch had put him through many difficult tests in june  he told patricia sellers of fortune  there was always this rap against me about being functionally proficient but not very strategic nardelli also had a reputation for being somewhat inarticulate nardelli had promised welch that he would not talk to other companies until welch had made his decision within minutes of the announcement nardelli was offered the presidency of home depot he demanded the ceos job the home depot board was convinced that the company needed a sophisticated leader from the outside in december  after  years at ge nardelli moved to atlanta with a compensation package amounting to  million in  although home depot cofounders bernie marcus and arthur blank continued on as cochairmen nardelli and the board soon asked blank to leave and marcus later retired marcus and blank had a simple business strategy continuous expansion in  years they had grown home depot from a single warehouse store to a store giant with  billion in annual sales but costs were out of control samestore stores open for at least a year sales were flat profit growth had slowed and the share price had dropped lowes home depots major competitor was doing far better brought six sigma to home depot after the announcement that home depot had hired a ceo with no retail experience nardelli tried to squelch concerns in january  he told fortune that his personal management style fit in with home depots corporate culture and that of all the companies he had looked at home depot most mirrored the way i like to operate in answer to a question about imposing gestyle management on home depot nardelli replied that to move from one social architecture and operating system and assume its  portable and the platform of understanding is there at the new place—thats a terrible mistake in response to a question about ge executives who were unsuccessful as outside ceos nardelli told patricia sellers in a march  fortune story that those executives didnt realize they were in a different environment they did not have the respect of the culture and werent sensitive to the pride of the employees nevertheless most of the  home depot employees had never heard of bob nardelli and some company veterans were openly hostile his first day on the job nardelli was astonished to discover that home depot lacked the infrastructure to send a companywide email its stores did not have automated inventory systems shipments were logged with clipboard and pencil home depot stores were rundown and had a reputation for poor customer service nardelli believed that better processes led to better quality and higher profits he increased information technology spending by  percent in  he spent  million on inventory shipping and tracking systems he substituted  different employee evaluation forms with two salaried personnel from the ceo down were to be rated by coworkers above and beneath them and salaries were based on the scores at a time when home depot was planning to hire about  new employees nardelli did not necessarily fire those with poor scores he first sought the advice of others and told underperformers exactly what they were doing wrong nardelli created a leadership institute modeled on ges to groom highpotential managers teaching them all aspects of merchandizing management and of course six sigma although home depot had tried to implement six sigma earlier it rarely had been used for retail businesses restructured the company although efficiency had never been a big priority at home depot it was nardellis operating principle the company had outgrown its laissezfaire doityourself management style nardelli replaced home depots decentralized structure of local store managers with a technologically sophisticated command center in his first six weeks he eliminated an entire management layer he combined divisions and reassigned or eliminated group presidents with all us division presidents reporting directly to him of the  senior managers  left and were replaced by managers—many of whom came from ge—with no retail experience in january  nardelli told institutional investor weve gone from  separate businesses under one banner to one brand with  stores we went from nine buying offices to one centralized management meant better supplier prices and increased margins orders were routed from central purchasing in atlanta through transfer centers to stores local suppliers were squeezed out and nardelli began buying out wholesalers however the new shipping systems required lower inventories leaving some stores sold out of popular merchandise such as electronics cutting inventories while pushing managers to move products resulted in fewer reorders home depots regional managers used to cutting their own deals with suppliers resisted their loss of control many opted out and took early retirement analysts began worrying that the company was changing too fast nardelli was criticized for dismantling the decentralized structure before investing in the information technology required for centralized management however between  and  annual earnings increased  percent to  billion by june  home depot was th on the fortune  valued at  billion—the largest american retailer after walmart upon his arrival nardelli immediately
