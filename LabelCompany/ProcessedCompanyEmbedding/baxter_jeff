tons of eyeballs seeing your offers”   “do you want to know the  problem that most entrepreneurs face which keeps them broke” from the desktop of jeff baxter location a place that mr trump despises mexico hehe i recently surveyed a group of marketers on my list and do you want to know what the  problem that they seem to face in their business generating traffic there’s no doubt that as an entrepreneur you need targeted eyeballs seeing what you offer or else you’re not going to make money or enough of it whether you’re a beginner and have not found your way online yet or maybe you’re an intermediate to advanced marketer with your own products or affiliate associations i’m about to solve  of your entrepreneurial problems by teaching you what i know for getting upwards of  targeted visitors per month to my sites “who am i and how my business changed when i mastered traffic generation” i got my start in this whole internet marketing journey back in about  just like many others starting out i knew that making money online was possible but i just couldn’t seem to put all of the pieces of the puzzle together and make it work there was a point where it seemed as if everything i did failed and did so miserablyi was frustrated and ready to give up but then it hit me i was making this whole online thing more complicated than it had to be as i just needed to make sure i remembered this simple formula that my mentors repetitively mentioned traffic offer sales i had the offers whether it was my own or some mlm company i was hooked up with but what kept me from succeeding was traffic to make a long story short i made a promise to myself to learn as much as i possibly could about traffic generation so that i would never have this”shortage of money” problem again knew that i had top notch offers but just needed more people seeing them and i could make bank once this piece of the puzzle was finally figured out that’s when my business took off just look at how much traffic i’m bringing in these days that’s not even a fraction of the various traffic stats i can show you but the point i’m trying to make is that i do this in real life no theory no funny business what’s even more cool about being able to send tons of people to my sites now are the sales more sales equals more money in the bank to live what most of us call the “internet marketing lifestyle” here’s just a glimpse into my life thanks to cracking the “traffic generation” code i’m pretty much able to do what i and when i want now as my business runs on autopilot of course this

entrepreneur   ding dong the doorbell rang for the final time as i was in the shower and tried my best to hurry and answer as i had a very special package waiting to be delivered that day by the time i opened the door i seen the fedex truck drive off and fortunately a receipt was left stating to pick up my package at the local post office filled with excitement i quickly grabbed the keys to my  toyota corolla and headed out “what can we do for you” said the middle aged caucasian man that was working in what seemed like one of the most gloomy post offices that i walked into in my entire  years of being on earth i’m not sure if it was the poor lighting or the atrocious smell that gave me a weird feeling but let’s just say it wasn’t the best environment for my precious package to be in “yes i just missed a delivery for jeff baxter and here’s the receipt” was my response to him he went to the back and as he brought my package upfront  i heard something that was like music to my ears “chirpchirpchirp” was the sound that came from the box that was handed to me which seemed like it weighed only a pound inside there was  freshly born baby chickens that i ordered from a catalog that was given to me by a neighbor i was always fascinated with animals and decided that i would give “raising chickens” a go for the first time looks like we have a guest within my batch of new chickens there was about  roosters males to the  hens females i can remember like it was yesterday being nearly  degrees outside i went to go check up on the crew which was about  months old now and graduated from being inside a small room in the house to having their very own habitation outside as i went to make sure that they had water  i seen something out of the corner of my eye inside one of the chicken coops and turned out it was a snake i immediately went to go and grab my  shotgun and by the time i returned he was gone i set out on a hunt i began to turn over every single board that was around the chicken pen and still no sign of him i circled around to the back of the pen where there was some ×’s which he could have slid under for some strange reason i felt like this was where he was hiding so i made sure to be extremely careful and began to toss each board one by one as i got to the last board i made sure my gun was ready and quickly moved it boom there he was about  feet worth of snake curled up allowing me to get a perfect shot off after i made the kill i noticed that the snake had a huuge lump towards his midsection once i stretched him out it looked like he swallowed a ball but of course being green when it came to dealing with chickens i had no clue what i was about to witness i decided to cut this particular section open on the snake and lo and behold there was a perfectly rounded brown egg inside as far as i was concerned it had not been cracked or contaminated so i washed it off to eat later on i mean c’mon  no need to waste food even if it’s been inside the belly of a snake this is how it all started although i had just faced a pretty intense situation i was super excited to know that my chickens started to lay eggs primarily it wasn’t even about trying to sell the eggs i just enjoyed eating something organic for the first time in my life i enjoyed going out to the chicken pen everyday to see how many eggs i could get oh and for my little “visitors” who liked to borrow what was mine i decided to plant some golf balls around the chicken pen and let’s just say i never had a problem since with nearly  hens i was getting a ton of eggs every single day and it was just way too much for myself and my family to consume so i decided to sell i did my research online and found out that i could sell organic eggs for up to  per dozen so that’s what i did people bought they didn’t care about the price they liked the taste of organic eggs that came from the hot gluteus maximus of a chicken that freely roamed and ate grasshoppers i sold out every single week and even started to buy eggs from another person who had free range chickens as well then turned around and sold for a higher price to keep up with demand i was a hustler i ordered more and more chickens until we couldn’t house anymore and it was at this time that the “entrepreneurial bug” was installed i enjoyed making people happy with my products i enjoyed making money with an honest gig that actually made people more healthy i lost interest in the chicken business but the entrepreneurship remained as i got older i was no longer interested in selling eggs so my flock grew smaller and smaller as it was extremely difficult to keep chickens with coyotes around and of course with the extreme weather conditions in the summer i no longer replenished the flock with new chickens so eventually all had died out as years went on i was still an entrepreneur inside as i did everything from learning the skill of “cutting hair” and becoming one of the top barbers in my school to doing other gigs that resulted in me creating my own economy long story short as time went on i stumbled upon “internet marketing” and seen how guys my age were making in a month what most people didn’t even make in a year selling digital products it really intrigued me but at the same time i was always “skeptical” about the whole internet thing and could only think scam fortunately i came across individuals who i felt like i could trust and learned as much as i possibly could from them i began to create my own digital products around different subjects and sometimes they did well sometimes they didnt as time went on i became better i learned more i had different subjects i could make products aboutbecame better at selling and eventually went on to become a fulltime internet entrepreneur here’s what i do now and how i can help you today i help two types of individuals  those who already have established businesses but are horrible at generating traffic leads and sales from the internet  those who want to learn the ropes to building their own digital based business from scratch my expertise includes copywriting traffic generation lead generation and product creation i love what i do and it all started from a chicken catalog that was handed to me back when i was about  years old today i’ve had the privilege to create multiple  figure online

 defense consulting careeredit baxter fell into his second profession almost by accident in the mids baxters interest in music recording technology led him to wonder about hardware and software that was originally developed for military use specifically datacompression algorithms and largecapacity storage devices his nextdoor neighbor was a retired engineer who had worked on the sidewinder missile program this neighbor bought baxter a subscription to aviation week magazine provoking his interest in additional militaryoriented publications and missile defense systems in particular he became selftaught in this area and at one point he wrote a fivepage paper that proposed converting the shipbased antiaircraft aegis missile into a rudimentary missile defense system he gave the paper to california republican congressman dana rohrabacher and his career as a defense consultant began backed by several influential capitol hill lawmakers baxter received a series of security clearances so he could work with classified information in  pennsylvania republican congressman curt weldon then the chairman of the house military research and development subcommittee nominated baxter to chair the civilian advisory board for ballistic missile defense baxters work with that panel led to consulting contracts with the pentagons missile defense agency mda and national geospatialintelligence agency he now consults to the us department of defense and the us intelligence community as well as for defenseoriented manufacturers including science applications international corporation saic northrop grumman corp general dynamics and general atomics aeronautical systems inc he has been quoted as saying his unconventional approach to thinking about terrorism tied to his interest in technology is a major reason he became sought after by the government we thought turntables were for playing records until rappers began to use them as instruments and we thought airplanes were for carrying passengers until terrorists realized they could be used as missiles baxter has said my big thing is to look at existing technologies and try to see other ways they can be used which happens in music all the time and happens to be what terrorists are incredibly good at baxter has also appeared in public debates and as a guest on cnn and fox news channel advocating missile defense he served as a national spokesman for americans for missile defense a coalition of organizations devoted to the issue in  baxter considered challenging rep brad sherman for the th congressional district
