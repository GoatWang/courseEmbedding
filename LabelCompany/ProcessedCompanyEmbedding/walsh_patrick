institutions by george clarke book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract february   some say that democracy is more likely to survive under parliamentary governments that result is not robust to the use of different variables from the database of political institutions a large new crosscountry database that may illuminate many other issues affecting and affected by political institutions this paper introduces a large new crosscountry database on political institutions the database on political institutions dpi beck clarke groff keefer and walsh summarize key variables many of them new compare this data set with others and explore the range of issues for which the data should prove invaluable among the novel variables they introduce several measures of tenure stability and checks and balances identification of parties with the government coalition or the opposition fragmentation of opposition and government parties in legislatures the authors illustrate the application of dpi variables to several problems in political economy stepan and skach for example find that democracy is more likely to survive under parliamentary governments than presidential systems but this result is not robust to the use of different variables from the dpi which raises puzzles for future research similarly roubini and sachs find that divided governments in the oecd run higher budget deficits after fiscal shocks replication of their work using dpi indicators of divided government indicates otherwise again suggesting issues for future research among questions in political science and economics that this database may illuminate the determinants of democratic consolidation the political conditions for economic reform the political and institutional roots of corruption and the elements of appropriate and institutionally sensitive design of economic policy this paper  a product of regulation and competition

prostate canceraverage ratingout ofstars based onreviewsby beaaservant  verified purchaserat age  my husband who we thought was in perfect health was diagnosed with prostate cancer our world was turned upside down his biopsy results were grim and we eventually discovered that the cancer was locally advanced several people recommended book titles or mailed us resources so i read many volumes this book was in my opinion the best of them all it was clearly written and the research in the  edition was fresh the author did not appear to hustle men into one particular treatment option but explains them all and affirms that each treatment plan will be unique to each man because his cancer is advanced my husband is receiving surgery hormone therapy and radiation after my initial first reading i have gone back to thoroughly reread each chapter as we begin each new phase of treatment dr walsh is on staff at johns hopkins the hospital is ranked  in the nation for cancer care and for decades was  for urology they specialize in prostate cancer the material in the book seems medically accurate based on all my other research this copy that i purchased from walmart was a gift for
