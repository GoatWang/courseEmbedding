announced his selection of cohen as secretary of defense cohen a republican about to retire from the united states senate was the right person clinton said to build on the achievements of william perry to secure the bipartisan support americas armed forces must have and clearly deserve in responding to his nomination cohen said that during his congressional career he had supported a nonpartisan national security policy and commended the president for appointing a republican to his cabinet cohen and president bill clinton at the pentagon september  during his confirmation hearings cohen said he thought on occasion he might differ with clinton on specific national security issues he implicitly criticized the clinton administration for lacking a clear strategy for leaving bosnia

for advanced weapons even if it necessitated further cuts in military personnel cohen questioned whether savings from base closings and acquisition reform could provide enough money for procurement of new weapons and equipment that the joint chiefs of staff thought necessary in the next few years he supported the expansion of nato and looked on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as the most serious problem the united states faced cohen and australian prime minister john howard at the pentagon june   after confirmation by a unanimous senate vote cohen was sworn in as the th secretary of defense on january   he then settled into a schedule much fuller than he had followed in the senate routinely he arrived at the pentagon before  am received an intelligence briefing and then met with the deputy secretary of defense john hamre – rudy de leon – and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen hugh shelton the rest of the day he devoted to policy and budget briefings visits with foreign and other dignitaries and to what he termed abc meetings at the white house with secretary of state madeleine albright and national security advisor sandy berger as well as president bill clinton he also traveled abroad several times during his first months in office defense budgetedit one of cohens first major duties was to present to congress the fiscal year  defense budget which had been prepared under secretary perry cohen requested a budget of  billion which represented  percent of the nations estimated gross domestic product for fy  cohen stressed three top budget priorities people recruiting and retaining skilled people through regular military pay raises new construction or modernization of barracks and programs for child care family support morale welfare and recreation readiness support for force readiness training exercises maintenance supplies and other essential needs and modernization development and upgrading of weapon and supporting systems to guarantee the combat superiority of us forces this meant increasing the funds available for procurement of new systems with the target set at  billion by fy when he presented the fy budget cohen noted that he would involve himself with the quadrennial defense review qdr which would focus on the challenges to us security and the nations military needs over the next decade or more when the qdr became public in may  it did not fundamentally alter the budget structure and doctrine of the military many defense experts thought it gave insufficient attention to new forms of warfare such as terrorist attacks electronic sabotage and the use of chemical and biological agents cohen stated that the pentagon would retain the two regional wars scenario adopted after the end of the cold war he decided to scale back purchases of jet fighters including the air forces f raptor and the navys faef super hornet as well as navy surface ships the review included cutting another  active duty service members— in the army  in the air force  in the navy and  in the marine corps as well as  reserve forces mainly in the army national guard and some  civilians departmentwide cohen also recommended two more rounds of base closings in  and  the pentagon hoped to save  billion annually over the next few years to make possible the purchase of new equipment and weapon systems without a substantial budget increase above the current level of  billion international relations and situationsedit cohen and sellapan ramanathan cohen general john h tilelli jr commander in chief united nations commandcombined forces commandus forces as he settled into office cohen faced the question of the expansion of the north atlantic treaty organization which he supported and its relationship to russia at a summit meeting between president clinton and russian president boris yeltsin in helsinki finland in march  yeltsin acknowledged the inevitability of broader nato membership two months later he agreed after negotiations with nato officials to sign an accord providing for a new permanent council to include russia the nato secretary general and a representative of the other nato nations to function as a forum in which russia could air a wide range of security issues that concerned that country formal signing of this agreement would pave the way for a july  invitation from nato to several nations probably including poland hungary and the czech republic to join the organization the proposed us missile defense system received attention at the helsinki summit where clinton and yeltsin agreed to an interpretation of the  antiballistic missile treaty allowing the united states to proceed with a limited missile defense system currently under development specifically clinton and yeltsin agreed to distinguish between a national missile defense system aimed against strategic weapons not allowed by the abmt and a theater missile defense system to guard against shorter range missile attacks some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic missile defenses the helsinki meeting also saw progress in arms control negotiations between the united states and russia a matter high on cohens agenda yeltsin and clinton agreed on the need for early russian ratification of the second strategic arms reduction treaty start ii and negotiation of start iii to make further significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of both nations cohen left and japanese prime minister yoshiro mori pose for photographers prior to their meeting at the kantei building in tokyo japan on september   the continuation at least until mid of the existing peacekeeping mission involving us forces in bosnia and the possibility that other such missions would arise worried cohen who earlier had expressed reservations about such operations humanitarian efforts that did not involve peacekeeping such as in rwanda in the recent past also seemed likely other persistent national security problems including tension with iraq in the persian gulf area libya in north africa and north korea in east asia could flare up again as could the arab–israeli conflict in preparing future budgets the challenge would be to find the right mix between money for operation and maintenance accounts on the one hand and modernization procurement funds on the other while facing the prospect of a flat dod budget of about  billion annually for the next decade or so a relatively new problem that could affect the dod budget was vertical integration in the defense industry it occurred on a large scale in the s as mergers of major defense contractors created a few huge dominant companies particularly in the aerospace industry they were called vertical because they incorporated most of the elements of the production process including parts and subcomponents cohen and other pentagon leaders began to worry that vertical integration could reduce competition and in the long run increase the costs of what the department of defense had to buy social issuesedit finally cohen had to address social issues that engaged the widest public interest these issues included the status and treatment of lesbians and gays in the military the role of women in combat as well as in other jobs in the services racism and sexual harassment recent yearsedit cohen and his wife author janet langhart august  after leaving the pentagon in  cohen founded the cohen group a business consulting and lobbyist firm with three

announced his selection of cohen as secretary of defense cohen a republican about to retire from the united states senate was the right person clinton said to build on the achievements of william perry to secure the bipartisan support americas armed forces must have and clearly deserve in responding to his nomination cohen said that during his congressional career he had supported a nonpartisan national security policy and commended the president for appointing a republican to his cabinet cohen and president bill clinton at the pentagon september  during his confirmation hearings cohen said he thought on occasion he might differ with clinton on specific national security issues he implicitly criticized the clinton administration for lacking a clear strategy for leaving bosnia and stated that he thought us troops should definitely be out by mid he also asserted that he would resist further budget cuts retain the two regional conflicts strategy and support spending increases for advanced weapons even if it necessitated further cuts in military personnel cohen questioned whether savings from base closings and acquisition reform could provide enough money for procurement of new weapons and equipment that the joint chiefs of staff thought necessary in the next few years he supported the expansion of nato and looked on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as the most serious problem the united states faced cohen and australian prime minister john howard at the pentagon june   after confirmation by a unanimous senate vote cohen was sworn in as the th secretary of defense on january   he then settled into a schedule much fuller than he had followed in the senate routinely he arrived at the pentagon before  am received an intelligence briefing and then met with the deputy secretary of defense john hamre – rudy de leon – and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen hugh shelton the rest of the day he devoted to policy and budget briefings visits with foreign and other dignitaries and to what he termed abc meetings at the white house with secretary of state madeleine albright and national security advisor sandy berger as well as president bill clinton he also traveled abroad several times during his first months in office defense budgetedit one of cohens first major duties was to present to congress the fiscal year  defense budget which had been prepared under secretary perry cohen requested a budget of  billion which represented  percent of the nations estimated gross domestic product for fy  cohen stressed three top budget priorities people recruiting and retaining skilled people through regular military pay raises new construction or modernization of barracks and programs for child care family support morale welfare and recreation readiness support for force readiness training exercises maintenance supplies and other essential needs and modernization development and upgrading of weapon and supporting systems to guarantee the combat superiority of us forces this meant increasing the funds available for procurement of new systems with the target set at  billion by fy when he presented the fy budget cohen noted that he would involve himself with the quadrennial defense review qdr which would focus on the challenges to us security and the nations military needs over the next decade or more when the qdr became public in may  it did not fundamentally alter the budget structure and doctrine of the military many defense experts thought it gave insufficient attention to new forms of warfare such as terrorist attacks electronic sabotage and the use of chemical and biological agents cohen stated that the pentagon would retain the two regional wars scenario adopted after the end of the cold war he decided to scale back purchases of jet fighters including the air forces f raptor and the navys faef super hornet as well as navy surface ships the review included cutting another  active duty service members— in the army  in the air force  in the navy and  in the marine corps as well as  reserve forces mainly in the army national guard and some  civilians departmentwide cohen also recommended two more rounds of base closings in  and  the pentagon hoped to save  billion annually over the next few years to make possible the purchase of new equipment and weapon systems without a substantial budget increase above the current level of  billion international relations and situationsedit cohen and sellapan ramanathan cohen general john h tilelli jr commander in chief united nations commandcombined forces commandus forces as he settled into office cohen faced the question of the expansion of the north atlantic treaty organization which he supported and its relationship to russia at a summit meeting between president clinton and russian president boris yeltsin in helsinki finland in march  yeltsin acknowledged the inevitability of broader nato membership two months later he agreed after negotiations with nato officials to sign an accord providing for a new permanent council to include russia the nato secretary general and a representative of the other nato nations to function as a forum in which russia could air a wide range of security issues that concerned that country formal signing of this agreement would pave the way for a july  invitation from nato to several nations probably including poland hungary and the czech republic to join the organization the proposed us missile defense system received attention at the helsinki summit where clinton and yeltsin agreed to an interpretation of the  antiballistic missile treaty allowing the united states to proceed with a limited missile defense system currently under development specifically clinton and yeltsin agreed to distinguish between a national missile defense system aimed against strategic weapons not allowed by the abmt and a theater missile defense system to guard against shorter range missile attacks some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic missile defenses the helsinki meeting also saw progress in arms control negotiations between the united states and russia a matter high on cohens agenda yeltsin and clinton agreed on the need for early russian ratification of the second strategic arms reduction treaty start ii and negotiation of start iii to make further significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of both nations cohen left and japanese prime minister yoshiro mori pose for photographers prior to their meeting at the kantei building in tokyo japan on september   the continuation at least until mid of the existing peacekeeping mission involving us forces in bosnia and the possibility that other such missions would arise worried cohen who earlier had expressed reservations about such operations humanitarian efforts that did not involve peacekeeping such as in rwanda in the recent past also seemed likely other persistent national security problems including tension with iraq in the persian gulf area libya in north africa and north korea in east asia could flare up again as could the arab–israeli conflict in preparing future budgets the challenge would be to find the right mix between money for operation and maintenance accounts on the one hand and modernization procurement funds on the other while facing the prospect of a flat dod budget of about  billion annually for the next decade or so a relatively new problem that could affect the dod budget was vertical integration in the defense industry it occurred on a large scale in the s as mergers of major defense contractors created a few huge dominant companies particularly in the aerospace industry they were called vertical because they incorporated most of the elements of the production process including parts and subcomponents cohen and other pentagon leaders began to worry that vertical integration could reduce competition and in the long run increase the costs of what the department of defense had to buy social issuesedit finally cohen had to address social issues that engaged the widest public interest these issues included the status and treatment of lesbians and gays in the military the role of women in combat as well as in other jobs in the services racism and

shorter range missile attacks some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic missile defenses the helsinki meeting

as in rwanda in the recent past also seemed likely other persistent national security problems including tension with iraq in the persian gulf area libya in north africa and north korea in east asia

later he agreed after negotiations with nato officials to sign an accord providing for a new permanent council to include russia the nato secretary general and a representative of the other nato
