 ratedann truly was heaven sent my original divorce was in another state pro se and i basically tied both my hands behind my back and didn’t even realize it it was a hard fight but there was absolutely no slacking on ann’s part i honestly believe the outcome of my custody issue was important to ann and legitimately cared ann provides a very reasonable rate based on your situation and she won’t seek to nickel and dime you every chance she gets she also won’t drag the case as long as possible in order to get more money understand as most things in life you can’t just throw money at her and then retire to the couch and expect a judgment in your favor simply put your results will be reflective of the effort you put in ann will always do the best possible with what you provide her you will have to provide accurate information to her and you will have to take ownership of your situation and do some work constantly keeping your case in the ear of the guardian ad litem by writing him or her keeping records of events and providing ann all the ammunition you can for her to make your case but she will not abandon you and will tell you exactly how and what you need to do she will still write anything that needs to be official and provide you with an opportunity to review before submitted she is the type of attorney that works for big boys and girls with a sense of personal responsibility and this is a huge tool she uses to keep her costs so reasonable make no mistake ann will make good on her end of the bargain she is at home in the courtroom mediation room and will ensure your side is heard loud and clear she has an uncanny way of arguing a case and maintaining the momentum the whole time maintaining the upmost in professionalism before your trial ann will give you advice of things you should or should not do you may not always fully understand why initially but follow it she knows what she is doing she never led me down a bad road and i know she won’t to you either ann was not a ghost when i needed to talk to her there were some times i had to talk to her as late as  oclock at night and at some points during my ordeal talked to her every day of the week i never paid  extra cent for those communications she really cared period ann always gave me an accurate assessment of the situation she didn’t lie or build up false hope then she fights like hell anyway making my argument if you are a dad with gumption that just wants what is fair or a hard working single mom who is being bullied in the courtroom by some high dollar legal eagle ann is right for you because of her my daughter is now out or a really bad situation and now has chance at a bright successful future ann was able to secure primary placement for one of my children and get enforceable fair visitation and rights for the other children i am honored to not only call ann my counsel but my friend thank you ann debt advisors law offices milwuakeemèg c rateddebt advisors was so very helpful to us mike georg is an excellent attorney he sits down with you going over the differences between chapters   he analyzes your situation helping you to decide whats best he is

easy task i was a wreck but it all went very smoothly thanks to the entire staff at debt advisors i highly recommend them to handle what can be a very traumatic thing to go through they all in particular attorney georg makes what could be a horrific stressful thing to go through a very easy to handle event in your life i am forever grateful for what attorney georg and his staff did for my

with paperwork that immigration needed as the case progressed sesini is approachable and helpful he understand the need of having a family united and the frustration that immigrants go through when we feel the law is unfair with us sesini is also very honest since the beginning he told me that was not a easy case to resolved but he was going to do his best to get my companions papers and pardon acceptedlaw office of stephen m govindoug w ratedattorney stephen govin is an outstanding defense attorney he represented our son in a twocount sexual assault case the case lasted  months and he never tired was relentless meticulous and pursued every court hearing and motion like it was the first one we sent many emails and made several calls to attorney govin he was always there for us he was very strategic and detailed throughout the entire process explaining each step and approach taken during the trial he was absolutely astonishing he was focused and captured the attention of the jury during his witness questioning and closing arguments he delivered his message flawlessly hammering on vital points he is on his way to becoming one of the best defense attorneys in the united states we are very fortunate to have discovered and reachedout to attorney govin our son received notguilty verdicts on both counts and the charges were acquitted our family will never forget his dedication through

documentsquestions one should ask a lawyer before hiring themto ensure you find a competent attorney who wont abuse your trust or drain your finances you have to make the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should
