racehorse inside a partnership managed by little red feather racingsmall raisewoodland hills casports      for the first time in thoroughbred racing history the little red feather racing club will create a racing partnership through crowdfunding equity under the new title iii laws the lrf thoroughbred fund “fund” provides the opportunity for anyone to pursue racehorse ownership the fund will be managed by one of america’s largest thoroughbred racing clubs – little red feather racing “lrf” lrf burst onto the national scene in  when its horse singletary captured the  breeders’ cup mile in  years lrf horses have won  races from  starts  and grossed  in purses through june  recently lrf has enjoyed the best  months in its history with  wins from  starts and over  in gross purses lrf currently manages stakes winners midnight storm chati’s on top bellamentary sheer pleasure and midnight miley        to crowdfund the first ever thoroughbred racing partnership where the participant receives real equity in each racehorse     lrf will manage the fund and use the final raise to buy up to six  thoroughbred racehorses with the intent of racing at santa anita park and del mar each investor will own a prorata percentage of the fund  here’s an exampleif the fund raises lrf will use the proceeds to purchase up to three racehorses and more if the final raise is higher  lrf will also set aside a suitable reserve to pay expenses and operational costs lrf will purchase the racehorses through traditional industry means for example the horses will be purchasedat public auctionvia a claiming race or through a private purchasewith  years experience lrf has the industry networking ability to purchase almost any racehorse that is for sale once purchased the horses will be trained by one of lrf’s trainers and prepare for its first race for the fund investors will be kept intimately abreast of the racing careers of the fund horses the hallmark of lrf is its ability to communicate the horse’s journey with its investors this “inside the locker room” communication provides a wealth of knowledge to both people new to ownership and those that have owned beforelrf will also provide an accounting summary of all activity and if applicable make a distribution of available proceeds to the investorsthe fund initially plans to dissolve by december    however if the fund is financially viable lrf at its election may continue the fund into  and beyond     owning a thoroughbred in the “sport of kings” is like an admission to an exclusive club besides the prorata equity in the fund investors will also receive the following perks           the gross proceeds of the offering to the company will be  if the minimum offering amount is raised and  is the maximum offering amount is raised the net proceeds of the offering after deduction of expenses of the offering including but not limited to the intermediary’s fees escrow fees legal fees accounting fees and management fees will be used by the company as working capital to purchase and maintain thoroughbred racehorses for racing at santa anita park del mar and other top racetracks  the following table lists the estimated use of proceeds of the offering if the minimum offering amount and the maximum offering amount are raised    the estimated use of proceeds set forth below illustrate the present expectation of the company lrf thoroughbred fund llc will have discretion to alter the use of proceeds as set forth below as company determines how to best accomplish its objectives                           established in  california’s largest racing club with over  active partners over  of lrf syndicates are made up of previous partners captured the gi breeders’ cup

kmain rules once an asset is sold or purse monies are earned funds will be distributed to fund partners andor used to acquire additional horses on or around december   manager will determine which horses will be sold or kept in racing         are there any other management fees or additional compensation paid to the managerlrf thoroughbred fund llc will pay the manager lrf’s standard    fee of the initial raise of all gross purses earned by the racehorses “off the top” of the sale of any racehorse    how much does it cost the investor per month in expenses nothing lrf thoroughbred fund llc will build in a suitable reserve for each racehorse to pay training and operational costs for a dedicated period  in the event the racehorses do not earn enough to maintain future expenses the manager has the authority to raise funds by issuing new shares and diluting current members to pay further expenses and operational costs a typical horse costs  per year in expenses    can i make moneyof course  seriously this is a high risk high reward investment lrf sold a horse at auction for  that originally cost its partners   lrf has also purchased a horse that unfortunately never ran  with over  horses managed the only honest thing we can tell you is your investment will probably fall in between those two scenarios… and you may have the time of your life regardless of the ultimate financial result how does the fund earn revenue two ways  earning purse money by finishing in the top five of a race or being sold hopefully as a stallion or broodmare  all purses will be deposited into the fund bank account and used to pay fund expenses the breakdown of a purse can be different for each race and placing in the race typically for a horse that wins a race the owner will net  from the purse for example if your horse wins a  race the net proceeds to the owner is  what race tracks will you run atlrf thoroughbred fund llc horses will likely initially only race in california at santa anita park or del mar notwithstanding your horses may run in kentucky new york florida and other circuits      how often and what kind of information will i receive about my racehorse as mentioned earlier if you are kept in the dark about what is going on with your horse how can you enjoy the journey communication is key to a successful ownership experiencelrf thoroughbred club llc will email as often as daily or weekly pertinent information about the fund horses and partnership   the hallmark of lrf is its ability to communicate the events of each horse’s career with its partners what if my horse gets hurt each horse will carry standard equine mortality insurance most if not all injuries in thoroughbred horse racing that occur do not result in death or cost the owner an amount over  in added veterinarian expenses career ending injuries do happen however in most instances the injury only prevents the horse from competing as a thoroughbred racehorse many horses go on to second careers as a broodmare or hunterjumper etc the manager has extensive experience trying to palce retired horses where they can maintain secondary careers  will i receive financial statements  of course  the fund will provide regulatory accounting statements as well as informal incomeexpense reports showing detailed transactions the fund        teamwilliam kochfounder managing partner little red

typically requiring all ownership interests are licensed meg hiers as mentioned in the first paragraph there has been a reinterpretation or changing of the law i believe that allows for investment without technical “ownership” which resides in the whole entity not the investors that make it up…at least that is how i understood it richard c the percentage of ownership is the key within partnerships in ohio – for example – “every member of a partnership possessing five per cent or more interest must acquire an owner’s license” andrew a interesting stuff i admire their commitment to new and innovating ideas having dealt with billy koch during and after the boycott of  i found him to be the most willing toc board member to devote his time and effort into making the game better on the gambling side he actually participated in a  person conference call in  to help make the p a reality i’ve always found him forthcoming and very willing to answer any question brought to him gary not so much mr furlong run…do not walk…but run as fast and as far way as one can from this “fund” investment…investing in a race horse as an owner is risky as it is but this is just absolutely and totally foolish… and while little red feather can ‘brag about their results’ there is indeed more to ‘results’ as the saying goes in investing in mutual funds – ‘past performances are not guaranteed of future results’… twitter tweets by raypaulick facebook paulick report receive morning headlines  news alerts go × sign up for our daily headline news sign up for our daily headline news name
