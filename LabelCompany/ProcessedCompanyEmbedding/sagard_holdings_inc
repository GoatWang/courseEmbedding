pm et share by jacquiemcnish fairfax financial holdings ltd and sagard capital partners have agreed to make a joint bid to acquire performance sports group ltd for more than  million as the sports equipment maker considers a plan to auction itself under bankruptcy court protection one person familiar with the plans said performance sports is preparing to file for protection from its creditors as early as monday under chapter  in the united states and a similar court process in canada the person said the exeter nh company was unable to win an extension from its lenders on a deadline friday to file its overdue audited annual financial statements the missed deadline puts the company at risk of defaulting on some debts as always the deal could fall apart there is no guarantee that performance sports will file for bankruptcy protection or that its lenders will support a sale of the struggling companys business fairfax sagard and torontobased brookfield asset management said last week they were considering a possible play for performance sports which dominates the north american sports market with such brands as bauer hockey gear and easton baseball equipment brookfield remains interested in supporting the fairfax and sagard bid the person said but hasnt yet decided whether to join the takeover bid or lend money through a socalled debtorinpossession loan such financing would allow performance sports to continue operating without interruption pending a courtsupervised auction process proposed bankruptcy buyouts are typically tested at auction to ensure creditors receive the highest recovery on what theyre owed brookfield and sagard together own a  stake in the company as of april performance sports owed  million to term lenders and   million on an assetbased loan although performance sports has a large market share in each of the hockey baseball lacrosse and roller hockey sectors for which it makes skates gloves bats and other equipment the company has struggled in the last two years with debts it shouldered to acquire eastons baseball and softball business for  million in  since the acquisition the companys baseball division has been beset with product problems and disappointing sales triggered in part by a spate of bankruptcy filings by retail sportsequipment chains that stock its goods the bankruptcy filing and subsequent liquidation of sports authority holdings inc in march triggered a  million loss of performance sports inventory according to a person familiar with the matter performance sports is listed on the new york stock exchange and toronto stock exchange in the last year the companys stock has dropped more than  shortly after the company announced in august that it was unable to file its annual results because of an internal investigation it revealed it is under investigation by the us securities and exchange commission and a canadian securities regulator lillian rizzo contributed to this article
