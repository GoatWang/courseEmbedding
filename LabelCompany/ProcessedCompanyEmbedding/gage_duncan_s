allen duncan individually and as guardian and conservator for zachary gage duncan et al record no      decided january   present lemons cj millette mims mcclanahan and powell jj  and russell and lacy sjj in this products liability action hyundai motor company ltd and hyundai motor america inc hyundai appeal from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of keith allen duncan and vanessa duncan guardians and conservators for zachary gage duncan gage and keith allen duncan and vanessa duncan individually hyundai contends the circuit court erred in admitting the opinion testimony of the duncans designated expert witness who testified that the location of the side airbag sensor in the  hyundai tiburon being driven by gage when he sustained injuries in a singlevehicle accident rendered the tiburon unreasonably dangerous we agree and will reverse the judgment of the circuit courti backgroundgage sustained a serious closedhead injury while driving his  hyundai tiburon when he lost control of the vehicle causing the vehicle to leave the road strike two snow banks and a large bale of hay before ultimately colliding with a tree on the drivers side of the vehicle although the tiburon was equipped with a side airbag system the airbag did not deploythe duncans brought an action against hyundai which manufactured and distributed the  tiburon being driven by gage and initially asserted claims for negligence failure to warn breach of implied warranty of merchantability breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and breach of express warranties at trial the duncans pursued only their claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability in which they assert that the “tiburon was defective unreasonably dangerous was not fit for the ordinary purpose for which it was intended and did not pass without objection in the industry in which it was sold” specifically the duncans contend that if the sensor for the side airbag system had been placed in a different location the airbag would have deployed and prevented gages injuryii expert testimony of design defectto support their claim the duncans designated geoffrey mahon mahon a mechanical engineer as an expert in airbag design to testify that the  hyundai tiburon was defectively designed mahon expressed the opinion that if hyundai had located the sensor for the side airbag system on the bpillar of the vehicle the pillar where the front door closes approximately  to  inches from the floor instead of on the crossmember underneath the drivers seat the side airbag would have deployed therefore according to mahon the location of the side airbag sensor on the crossmember rendered the  tiburon unreasonably dangerousa motion in limineprior to trial hyundai moved to exclude mahons opinions as having an insufficient foundation because mahon did not conduct any analysis to determine whether the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor had been located where mahon proposedwhen deposed mahon testified that in reaching his opinion he relied upon a computeraided engineering study conducted by hyundai in  in which hyundai analyzed  potential locations for the side airbag sensor including a location on the bpillar that was  to  inches from the floor mahon did not adopt any of the  locations analyzed by hyundai for his placement of the side airbag sensor but determined that a location on the bpillar approximately  to  inches from the floor “would be his first choice” he further explained that since hyundai did not analyze the location he proposed he would “have to run tests to verify that thats just the right location but based on hyundais evidence of the somewhat higher bpillar location that looks very promising”while mahon believed the best location for the sensor was at the bpillar he testified he did no testing to determine if the side airbag would have deployed in gages accident had the sensor been placed at any other locationq ․ have you done any test or calculation to show that some other sensing system location if used in the duncan tiburon would have caused the side air bag to fire in this crasha i have not done any tests i think as i indicated earlier nor have i done any serious calculations what ive done is look at the signal at the bpillar and the signal at the location and concluded that i got a much more robust and timely signal at the bpillaremphasis added the circuit court denied hyundais motion to exclude mahons testimony and he was permitted to express his opinions at trial over hyundais objections b trial testimonyat trial mahon testified that hyundai was not required under federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss to install a sideimpact airbag system in the  tiburon and that the  tiburon would have complied with the fmvss for side impact protection without any side airbag system nevertheless according to mahon if a manufacturer decides to put in an airbag system and “tell people theres a safety system in this car thats going to work a certain way and then it doesnt work its got to work i mean thats just improper”mahons initial impression of the airbag system was that “the airbag should have gone off” but upon further investigation he concluded that the system was acting as designed “so this indicates that it was designed improperly because this is a crash where you really need an airbag” mahon agreed that the  tiburon with the side airbag system complied with fmvss  the standard specifically related to side impact protection he further acknowledged that the  tiburon “did reasonably well” when hyundai conducted  crash tests in which it ran the vehicle into different types of barriers at different speeds and angles with the side airbag sensor located on the crossmember underneath the drivers seat in mahons opinion however the side airbag would have deployed in gages accident if the sensor for the side airbag system had been located on the bpillar approximately  to  inches from the floor according to mahon this was true even though the sensor on the crossmember underneath the drivers seat was closer to the point of impact than it would have been if the sensor had been located in the bpillar because hyundais  location study showed that there was a much better signal on the bpillar in mahons view therefore the  tiburon was defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous because the sensor for the side airbag system was not located on the bpillarconsistent with his deposition testimony mahon testified at trial that he did not perform an analysis to determine whether the side airbag in the  tiburon would have deployed if the sensor was in a different location but relied upon the results of the location study undertaken by hyundai in  mahon conceded that the location on the bpillar considered by hyundai was located  to  inches from the floor and he had no data demonstrating the performance of a sensor located on the bpillar  to  inches from the floor he further agreed that because the airbag system must work quickly that is the sensor system must decide within  milliseconds of a crash event whether an airbag is required and then inflate the airbag in  to  milliseconds the location of the sensor is important to the overall crash sensing system such that inches and even increments smaller than inches matter in the determination of the location of the sensorthough mahon testified that the vehicles crash sensing system is “a combination of the structure of the vehicle the sensors themselves and then any algorithm ․ working together to make a decision whether or not this event is worthy of an airbag” he acknowledged that he had not performed any tests to determine whether any different sensor location structure or mathematical algorithm would have caused the side airbag to deploy in gages crashq have you done any test or calculation to show that some other side sensor location if used in the duncan tiburon would have caused the side airbag to fire in this crasha based on my industry experience my analysis says yes have i done a calculation noq have you done any test a of course notq ․ have you done any test or calculation to show that some other structure if used in the duncan tiburon would have caused the side airbag to fire in this crasha havent done itq have you done any test or calculation to show that some other algorithm if used in the duncan tiburon would have caused the side airbag to fire in this crasha well in fact i think it would i havent done that workemphasis added relying instead on his “industry experience” mahon testified that the data in hyundais location study “spoke to him ․ as one skilled in the art”iii analysison appeal hyundai argues there was an insufficient foundation for mahons opinion that the location of the sensor for the side airbag system rendered the  tiburon unreasonably dangerous expert opinion may be admitted to assist the fact finder if such opinion satisfies certain requirements “including the requirement of an adequate factual foundation” forbes v rapp  va    sed    see vacode §§ – and – va r evid  and  countryside corp v taylor  va    sed    since we review the circuit courts evidentiary rulings using an abuse of discretion standard we will reverse the circuit courts decision to admit evidence only upon a finding of abuse of that discretion john crane inc v jones  va    sed    a circuit court though “has no discretion to admit clearly inadmissible evidence” harman v honeywell intl inc  va    sed   as we have stated “qualification of an expert witness does not insure admission of his every statement and opinion” swiney v overby  va    sed    while code § – allows an expert to express an opinion without initially disclosing the basis for the opinion “we have never however construed that section to permit the admission of expert testimony that lacks evidentiary support” vasquez v mabini  va    sed    expert opinion must be premised upon assumptions that have a sufficient factual basis and take into account all relevant variables“expert testimony founded upon assumptions that have no basis in fact is not merely subject to refutation by crossexamination or by counterexperts it is inadmissible failure of the trial court to strike such testimony upon a motion timely made is error subject to reversal on appeal furthermore expert testimony is inadmissible if the expert fails to consider all the variables that bear upon the inferences to be deduced from the facts observed”cnh america llc v smith  va    sed    quoting vasquez  va at   sed at mahons opinion that the  tiburon was unreasonably dangerous was premised upon his assumption that the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor had been located on the vehicles bpillar yet as mahon readily conceded he did not perform any analysis or calculations to support this assumption in fact mahon admitted that the crash sensing system depends upon a combination of the structure of the vehicle the sensors themselves and any algorithm but he did not perform any tests to determine whether a different sensor location structure or algorithm would have caused the side airbag to deploy in gages crash furthermore despite his testimony that inches and even increments smaller than inches matter when choosing the sensor location his proposed location was more than four inches from any location studied by hyundaiin short mahons opinion that the  tiburon was unreasonably dangerous was without sufficient evidentiary support because it was premised upon his assumption that the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor was at his proposed location—an assumption that clearly lacked a sufficient factual basis and disregarded the variables he acknowledged as bearing upon the sensor location determination although experts may extrapolate opinions from existing data a circuit court should not admit expert opinion “which is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert” general elec co v joiner  us    sct   ledd   decided under the version of fedrevid  which the general assembly adopted verbatim in current code § –a mahons opinion that the vehicle was unreasonably dangerous was based on his ipse dixit assumption that the side airbag would have deployed in gages crash if the sensor had been located on the bpillar but the “analytical gap” between the data mahon relied upon from hyundais location study and the opinion he proffered was “simply too great” id therefore mahons opinion was inadmissible and the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting itthe duncans relied upon mahons opinion that the  tiburon was unreasonably dangerous to satisfy their burden of proving that hyundai breached its implied warranty of merchantability as we have concluded however mahons opinion was premised upon his unfounded assumption that the side airbag would have deployed if the sensor had been located on the bpillar of the vehicle instead of on the crossmember underneath the drivers seat because mahons opinion supplied the only support for the duncans claim that the vehicle was unreasonably dangerous the inadmissibility of mahons opinion as a matter of law is fatal to the duncans claim and entitles hyundai to judgment as a matter of lawiv conclusionfor the foregoing reasons we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and enter final judgment for hyundaireversed and final judgmenti disagree with majoritys conclusion that the opinion of geoff mahon the plaintiffs expert lacked an adequate foundation and should have been struck in my opinion the majority reaches this conclusion by improperly focusing on mahons preferred location for the side airbag sensor even though it is clear that he did not base his conclusion on this preferred location in so doing the majority fails to view mahons testimony in the light most favorable to the duncans the prevailing party below see dagner v anderson  va    sed    viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below when reviewing whether the trial court erred in allowing expert testimonyon direct examination mahon clearly relied on the findings of hyundais  location study and his calculations from the crash severity analysis to determine that the airbag would have deployed if the sensor was in the specific location on the bpillar that hyundai tested in the  location study hereafter referred to as the “bpillar location” according to mahon the  location study indicated that the signal received by the cross member had “less amplitude” and was “later than at the more outboard location such as the sill and the bpillar or even the door” indeed he goes on to specifically state that “hyundais own location study ․ shows that you get a much better signal on the bpillar than you do on the cross member” furthermore the crash severity analysis indicated that the gforces generated by the impact in this case were significantly higher than the threshold hyundai established for triggering an airbag specifically he calculated that the impact in the present case generated approximately  gs whereas hyundais own data indicated that it wanted an airbag to deploy at  gs or aboveusing the signal strength data contained in the  location study he extrapolated that the airbag did not deploy because the sensor did not receive a strong enough signal due to its location on the cross member specifically he opined that the cross member was too far “inboard” and not rigid enough to receive the necessary signal he went on to determine that because the bpillar was a more rigid structure located in the crush zone a sensor placed there would receive a stronger signal resulting in airbag deployment thus in mahons expert opinion the bpillar location would have resulted in airbag deployment in the present case the majority however never addresses any of this testimony by mahon indeed notwithstanding the fact that almost all of mahons testimony related to sensor placement in a specific location on the bpillar ie the location on the bpillar subject to testing in the  location study the majority characterizes this testimony as disregarding “the variables ․ bearing upon the sensor location determination” instead the majority focuses on statements by mahon relating to what he believed would be the ideal location for a side airbag sensor in the  tiburon specifically the majority focuses on the testimony that mahon believed that the ideal location for the airbag sensor would be on the bpillar approximately four to six inches from the floor hereafter referred to as the “proposed location”it is important to note however that there was no mention of the proposed location during mahons direct examination rather it is on crossexamination that the idea of placing the sensor in the proposed location was first brought up at trial even then the proposed location was only brought up after hyundais attorney confirmed that mahons prior testimony about the bpillar location was based on the  location study the majority also relies on mahons testimony where he “admits” that he had not done any tests or calculations showing that placing the sensor in another location would have resulted in the airbag deploying in my opinion however this testimony is taken completely out of context the testimony cited by the majority is clearly in reference to the proposed location not the bpillar location studied by hyundai indeed it is particularly telling that the quoted exchange takes place immediately after the discussion of the proposed location thus placed in the proper context it is clear that mahon was admitting that he had not performed any tests to determine whether the proposed location would have caused the side airbag to deploy in gages crash moreover this “admission” is rebutted by mahons lengthy testimony about the calculations he performed as part of his crash severity analysis with regard to the bpillar location mahon consistently maintained that based on hyundais own study and his calculations in the crash severity analysis a sensor placed on the bpillar in the location tested by hyundai in the  location study would have deployed in this accident“expert testimony is inadmissible if it is speculative or founded on assumptions that have an insufficient factual basis” john v im  va    sed    for that reason i agree with the majority that mahons testimony about the proposed location was without sufficient foundation however the majoritys opinion goes significantly beyond striking mahons testimony about the proposed location rather the majority implies that because mahon in relying on his knowledge and experience believes a better untested alternative potentially exists his opinion as a whole is invalid the majority gives no indication how the foundation of mahons testimony relating to the bpillar location is undermined by mahons belief that the proposed location may be better than any of the tested locations further there is nothing in the record indicating that he based his testimony about the bpillar location on his belief that the proposed location may offer a better alternative to those tested in the  location study nor is such a belief mutually exclusive with his testimony about the bpillar location accordingly in my opinion mahons opinion about the bpillar location had sufficient foundation and therefore the trial court did not err in allowing him to testifythat said i would still reverse the decision of the trial court in my opinion the trial court erred in refusing to give hyundais proposed jury instruction  a litigant is entitled to jury instructions supporting his or her theory of the case if sufficient evidence is introduced to support that theory and if the instructions correctly state the law when we review the content of jury instructions our sole responsibility ․ is to see that the law has been clearly stated determining whether a proffered jury instruction accurately states relevant legal principles is a question of law reviewed de novo on appealsmith v kim  va    sed    citations and internal quotation marks omittedhyundais proposed jury instruction  is an accurate statement of the law indeed it does not inform the jury that hyundais compliance with the federal motor vehicle safety standards “fmvss” was dispositive rather it merely provides the jury with a guide for determining whether the tiburon was reasonably safe or unreasonably dangerous furthermore as the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit has recognized evidence relating to a manufacturers compliance with the fmvss is “relevant and necessary” to demonstrate a companys care in bringing a product to market slm v dorel juvenile group inc  fedappx   th cir approving a similar instruction relating to a different fmvss standard therefore i would reverse the trial courts judgment

from custom shop tales from custom shop skip to content tone seekers → the way of wire posted on may   by joe by kevin beller seymour duncan’s vp of engineering  new product development explains how this crucial component shapes your sound   there aren’t many parts in a traditional guitar pickup magnets wire and a bobbin or coil former to hold them together but these simple components form a complex interactive system one in which small variations in materials can have a huge impact on your sound take wire for example during my  years at seymour duncan we’ve spent countless hours listening to and documenting how different types of wire affect a pickup’s sound the gauge or size of the wire its insulation type and thickness the purity and suppleness of the copper — they all influence the tone in subtle yet important ways pickup wire is as fine as a hair on your head the thick and thin of it we use a wide variety of wire gauges in our pickups most frequently in the  to  awg range this wire usually starts out as a big heavy spool of gauge wire as thick around as your pinky they draw it through metal dies again and again until it’s approximately the thickness of a hair on your head over the years we have determined which gauges are most conducive to certain tone categories here’s an example two pickups can have an identical number of turns and identical magnets but by using a different gauge of wire we can make one a little fatter sounding while having a smoother on the top end aside from tonal considerations we sometimes choose a thinner wire for space reasons the more winds a pickup has the hotter the output so if you’re winding a pickup that has to be very compact that may call for finergauge wire for example a customer who had some challenging requirements for a custom dobro pickup recently approached us he wanted the output as high as possible but the overall height could not exceed ” using a fairly fine gauge of magnet wire and a special magnetic structure we were able to create a powerful and very compact pickup that could slide into the tight space beneath the strings we’ve done numerous custom guitar pickups with similar challenges  different insulation materials yield types different tones about insulation there are at least  different types of wire insulation there are polyurethanes nylons polynylons polyester and teflon to name a few the insulation has a major effect on a pickup’s sound and over the years we’ve learned how to use different types of insulation to refine a pickup’s tonal response for example we often use wire with heavier insulation to maintain more highend detail while not strictly a type of insulation bondable wires are also available these have an adhesive overcoat that can be activated by heat or chemicals with proper tooling it’s possible to wind freestanding coils without having to use a bobbin structure of any sort this can be useful in certain specialized applications but we have avoided bondable wires because the winding and layering characteristics are inferior to conventional magnet wire the right stuffwhatever the wire type we use vendors who care as much about quality as we do and we don’t mind paying extra to obtain wire that exceeds industrystandard tolerances beyond that we test every case of wire that comes in we measure the overall thickness to make sure it’s within spec and we measure the resistance per foot down to three decimal places we measure all wire for consistent thickness and resistance of course we use periodaccurate wire in all our vintagestyle pickups one popular vintagestyle insulation is formvar which was used on old strats and on some jazz bass pickups but the insulation vintage buffs know best is plain enamel with its blackishpurple coating plain enamel wire was common in the ’s and into the ’s before the new insulations had been invented it was used in all the old gibson pafs and many of the earlier fender instruments  we use plain enamel wire in such pickups as the stl and str tele pickups vintagestyle pafs like the ’ model and seth lover many antiquity models and of course on many custom shop models plain enamel wire must be sanded prior to soldering finding quality enamel wire today there is little demand for plain enamel wire — except for those of us who are passionate about tone  you have to sand the wire by hand before you can solder it and not many companies want to add that extra labor as a result there are only a few companies who still make true plain enamel wire with so few manufacturers quality control can be a real problem there’s one particular vendor i won’t mention whose wire is so full of voids it’s almost unusable then there is a lot of wire that looks right with that nice blackishpurple color but it’s not even real enamel so we buy in large quantities from a company that we have determined is the best at providing voidfree wellannealed wire annealing is the process of heating and cooling the wire under controlled conditions to restore flexibility and suppleness and remove workhardening stresses it’s hard to wind a nice controlled coil and get that critical layering right when the wire hasn’t been annealed properly beyond copper we use silver in our new zephyr pickups silver is the only material that has a lower dc resistance per unit length than copper we use silver wire in all our zephyr pickups unfortunately it’s brutally expensive these days but there’s a remarkable difference between the sounds of silver and copper pickups wound with silver wire have powerful dynamics explosive attack and a complex harmonically rich sound while producing superior individual note definition and detail in chords silver is more supple than copper so it winds a very nice and regular coil i use silver when a customer requests it or when someone wants to extend the pickups’ response at both ends of the sonic spectrum not just the wire but the way you wind it voicing a pickup isn’t just a matter of selecting the right wire insulation and number of turns — how you lay the wire is at least as important among other things this determines the pickup’s distributed capacitance which refers to the capacitor formed between the layers as the coil is wound this property affects the resonant frequency of the coil and dictates the highfrequency rolloff point so it’s one of the factors that let us finetune a pickup’s highend response the winding techniques also help determine each pickup’s “voice” over the years we’ve developed some very interesting ways to get a variety of tones from our pickups whether it’s handwinding or precisely controlling the winding pitch on our cnc production machines every sd pickup whether it’s from custom shop or our production floor is designed with these considerations in mind crafting the perfect pickup voicing a pickup is a delicate balancing act of tonality a constant giveandtake but thanks to all those years of listening and analysis we can control the complex interaction of wire type and winding technique we choose the materials and production techniques to deliver exactly the sound you’re looking for kevin and seymour in the early s’ a lifelong bassist kevin met seymour through a local music shop where seymour did repairs “i used to take my gibson bass to him all the time” he remembers “like me he was obsessed with getting the right sound” kevin joined the fledgling seymour duncan company in  and became head of engineering a few years later according to cofounder and longtime company president cathy duncan kevin had the right talent at the right time “as we started growing we needed someone with kevin’s level of precision” she recalls “a lot of technical standards were pretty loose back then but we wanted to aim higher they say vintage pickups vary like snowflakes which is only okay if you’re lucky enough to get one of the good ones thanks to kevin’s persistence and precision we can give musicians a perfect snowflake every time” this entry was posted in seymour duncan company bookmark the permalink tone seekers → httpwwwfacebookcomshaunkrisher shaun krisher fact

given space stratofuzz if you wanted to pack the most copper into a given space you’d be better off with hexagonal wire tessellating hexagons in this way is the most efficient way to do it hence why natural objects like honeycombs use a hexagonal structure tymlaird i’d be interested in seeing if anyone has experimented with using wire extrusion profiles other than round since the wire can come in square triangle hex ribbon etc profiles and has anyone made pickups where the winds lay perfectly against the next one like in high end speaker voice coils scatter winding tends to introduce distortions into the signal where a “perfect lay” coil would more exactly transmit the actual sound of the string vibration in theory also consider that electricity follows a “skin effect” and tends to follow the surface of the wire so that a wire with a cross section shaped like a star drive could have more surface area than a round wire and could deliver a stronger signal for the amount of wire used it would also tend to have more space between windings to introduce more of that distortion in the scatter windings ijams sum electricity has been found to travel on the surface of a conductor or wire mostly hex shape is interesting to perhaps try side by side with round coils and gauge and equal turns and then check the resistance and sound for a difference in highs  lows and clarity vs not clear sounding high amperage cables are now made of finer wires due to the surface travel of electricity sdsd the so called “skin effect” is only happening in highfrequency applications audio signals are not even near those freqs about a ghz more may get you there the wire profile would change other things though probably resistance and the resulting capacitanceinductance would be different dynamically might be interesting to test it speakers are wound like that in order to reduce air gap and thus also losses and distortion damon sasser is it possible to use lithium wire for winding pickups is lithium good for conducting a magnetic field as it does an electric seymourduncanblog actually it has about th the conductivity of say copper charleston man lithium is not a safe product for such use and is highly reactive to water including humidity why on earth would you wish to use such a thing read this httpfmclithiumcomportalsfmclithiumcontentdocsdownloadlithiummetalsafetyversionpdf and think of a different type wire and forget lithium john oconnor anyway you can tell me the company you use “we buy in large quantities from a company that we have determined is the best at providing voidfree wellannealed wire” charleston man once copper wire is extruded to the point of the thickness of a human hair…a void will simply break the wire clearly they are buying bulk copper wire from company a and then sending it to company b that specializes in extrusion you should locate a company that specializes in extrusion and they can tell you what company provided good core wire to start from search for archives september  september  september  may  recent posts mj – pickup perfectionist
