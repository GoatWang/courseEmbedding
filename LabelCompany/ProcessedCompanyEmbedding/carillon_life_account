summary of prospectus information and diagram of the policy should be read in conjunction with the detailed information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus unless otherwise indicated the description of the policy in this prospectus assumes that the policy is in force and there is no outstanding policy debt the policy is similar in many ways to fixedbenefit life insurance as with fixedbenefit life insurance the owner of a policy pays premium payments for insurance coverage on the person insured also like fixedbenefit life insurance the policy provides for accumulation of net premiums and a cash surrender value which is payable if the policy is surrendered during the insureds lifetime as with fixedbenefit life insurance the cash surrender value during the early policy years is likely to be substantially lower than the premium payments paid however the policy differs from fixedbenefit life insurance in several important respects unlike fixedbenefit life insurance the death benefit may and the account value will increase or decrease to reflect the investment performance of the subdivisions to which the account value is allocated also there is no guaranteed minimum cash surrender value nonetheless union central guarantees to keep the policy in force during the first three policy years so long as the minimum monthly premium requirement has been met see minimum guaranteed period page  otherwise if the cash surrender value is insufficient to pay charges due the policy will lapse without value after a grace period see premiums to prevent lapse page  if a policy lapses while loans are outstanding adverse tax consequences may result see tax considerations page  the most important features of the policy such as charges cash benefits death benefits and calculation of policy values are summarized in the diagram on the following pages purpose of the policy the policy is designed to be a longterm investment providing insurance benefits the policy should be evaluated in conjunction with other insurance policies owned by you as well as your need for insurance and the policys long term investment potential it may not be advantageous to replace existing insurance coverage with the policy in particular replacement should be carefully considered if the decision to replace existing coverage is based primarily on a comparison of policy illustrations see below illustrations illustrations in this prospectus or used in connection with the purchase of a policy are based on hypothetical rates of return these rates are not guaranteed they are illustrative only and should not be deemed a representation of past or future performance actual rates of return may be higher or lower than those reflected in any illustrations and therefore actual values will be different from these illustrated tax considerations union central intends for the policy to satisfy the definition of a life insurance contract under section  of the internal revenue code certain policy transactions including the payment of premiums may cause a policy to be a modified endowment contract under the internal revenue code for further discussion of the tax status of a policy and the tax consequences of being treated as a life insurance contract or a modified endowment contract see page  free look right to cancel and conversion right for a limited time

please note that all of the portfolios described in the prospectuses for the portfolios may not be available under the policy moreover union central cannot guarantee that each fund will always be available for its variable life contracts but in the unlikely event that a fund is not available union central will take reasonable steps to secure the availability of a comparable fund shares of each portfolio are purchased and redeemed at net asset value without a sales charge the portfolios presently serve as the investment media for the policies in addition the portfolios may sell shares to separate accounts of other insurance companies to fund variable annuity contracts andor variable life insurance policies andor to certain retirement plans qualifying under section  of the code union central currently does not foresee any disadvantages to owners that would arise from the possible sale of shares to support the variable contracts of other insurance companies or from the possible sale of shares to such retirement plans however the board of directors of each fund will monitor events in order to identify any material irreconcilable conflicts that might possibly arise if the shares of that fund were also offered to support variable contracts other than the policies or to support retirement plans in event of such a conflict the board of directors of that fund would determine what action if any should be taken in response to the conflict in addition if union central believes that the funds response to any such conflicts insufficiently protects owners it will take appropriate action on its own which may include withdrawing the separate accounts investment in that fund see the prospectuses for the portfolios for more detail american century investment management

or substitution of investments union central reserves the right subject to applicable law to make additions to deletions from or substitutions for the shares that are held in the separate account or that the separate account may purchase if the shares of a portfolio are no longer available for investment or if in union centrals judgment further investment in any portfolio should become inappropriate in view of the purposes of the separate account union central may redeem the shares if any of that portfolio and substitute shares of another registered openend management company or unit investment trust union central will not substitute any shares attributable to a policys interest in the separate account without notice and prior approval of the sec and state insurance authorities to the extent required by the  act or other applicable law union central also reserves the right to establish additional subaccounts of the separate account each of which would invest in shares corresponding to a new portfolio or in shares of another investment company having a specific investment objective subject to applicable law and any required sec approval union central may in its sole discretion establish new subaccounts or eliminate one or more subaccounts if marketing needs tax considerations or investment conditions warrant any new subaccount may be made available to existing owners on a basis to be determined by union central if any of these substitutions or changes are made union central may by appropriate endorsement change the policy to reflect the substitution or other change if union central deems it to be in the best interests of owners and subject to any approvals that may be required under applicable law the separate account may be operated as a management company under the  act it may be deregistered under that act if registration is no longer required or it may be combined with other union central separate accounts union central reserves the right to make any changes to the separate account required by the  act or other applicable law or regulation voting rights union central is the legal owner of shares held by the subaccounts and as such has the right to vote on all matters submitted to shareholders of the portfolios however as required by law union central will vote shares held in the subaccounts at regular and special meetings of shareholders of the portfolios in accordance with instructions received from owners with account value in the subdivisions should the applicable federal securities laws regulations or interpretations thereof change union central may be permitted to vote shares of the portfolios in its own right and if so union central may elect to do so to obtain voting instructions from owners before a meeting owners will be sent voting instruction material a voting instruction form and any other related material the number of shares held by each subaccount for which an owner may give voting instructions is currently determined by dividing the portion of the owners account value in the subdivision corresponding to the subaccount by the net asset value of one share of the applicable portfolio fractional votes will be counted the number of votes for which an owner may give instructions will be determined as of the date coincident with the date established by the fund for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the relevant meeting of the fund shares held by a subaccount for which no timely instructions are received will be voted by union central in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions are received union central may if required by state insurance officials disregard owner voting instructions if such instructions would require shares to be voted so as to cause a change in subclassification or investment objectives of one or more of the portfolios or to approve or disapprove an investment advisory agreement in addition union central may under certain circumstances disregard voting instructions that would require changes in the investment advisory agreement or investment adviser of one or more of the portfolios provided that union central reasonably disapproves of such changes in accordance with applicable federal regulations if union central ever disregards voting instructions owners will be advised of that action and of the reasons for such action in the next semiannual report finally union central reserves the right to modify the manner in which the weight to be given to passthrough voting instructions is

under the policy the insured is the owner unless a different owner is named in the application the owner may by notice name a contingent owner or a new owner while the insured is living if more than one person is named as owner they are joint owners any transaction under the policy except for telephone transfers of account value will require the authorization of all owners unless provided

may have tax consequences see tax considerations page  purchase of the policy for specialized purposes the policy provides a death benefit and an accumulation of account value it can be used for various individual and business planning purposes purchasing the policy for such purposes entails certain risks for example if the investment performance of the subaccounts to which account value is allocated is poorer than anticipated or if sufficient premiums are not paid or account value maintained the policy may lapse or may not accumulate sufficient account value to fund the purpose for which the policy was purchased loans and partial cash surrenders may significantly affect current and future account value cash surrender value and death benefit proceeds depending upon subaccount investment performance and the amount of loans and partial cash surrenders the policy may lapse because the policy is designed to provide benefits on a longterm basis before purchasing a policy for a specialized purpose a purchaser should consider whether the longterm nature of the policy and the impact of loans and partial cash surrenders is consistent with the purpose for which it is being considered using a policy for a specialized purpose may have tax consequences see tax considerations free look right to cancel the policy you may cancel your policy for a refund during your freelook

specified intervals eg quarterly semiannually or annually until the maturity date if you elect union central will also arrange for payment of planned period premiums on a monthly basis under a preauthorized payment arrangement you are not required to pay premium payments in accordance with these plans rather you can pay more or less than planned or skip a planned periodic premium entirely see however premium payments to prevent lapse page  currently there is no minimum amount for each premium union central may establish a minimum amount  days after we send the owner a written notice of such increase subject to the limits described below you can change the amount and frequency of planned periodic premiums whenever you want by sending notice to the home office however union central reserves the right to limit the amount of a premium payment or the total premium payments paid unless otherwise requested you will be sent reminder notices for planned periodic premiums reminder

the account value at the time of an increase in the specified amount and the amount of the increase requested an additional premium payment may be necessary or a change in the amount of planned periodic premiums may be advisable see changes in specified amount page  in the event that you increase the specified amount you should contact your union central agent to assist you in determining if additional premium payments are necessary or appropriate premium payments to prevent lapse failure to pay planned periodic premiums will not necessarily cause a policy to lapse conversely paying all planned periodic premiums will not necessarily guarantee that a policy will not lapse except when the minimum guaranteed period is in effect rather whether a policy lapses depends on whether its cash surrender value is sufficient to cover the monthly deduction see page  when due if the cash surrender value on a monthly date is less than the amount of the monthly deduction to be deducted on that date and the minimum guaranteed period is not in effect the policy will be in default and a grace period will begin this could happen if investment experience has been sufficiently unfavorable that it has resulted in a decrease in cash surrender value or the cash surrender value has decreased because you have not paid sufficient premium payments to offset the monthly deduction grace period if your policy goes into default you will be allowed a day grace period to pay a premium payment sufficient to cover the monthly deductions due during the grace period union central will send notice of the amount required to be paid during the grace period grace period premium payment to your last known address and the address of any assignee of record the grace period will begin when the notice is sent your policy will remain in effect during the grace period if the insured should die during the grace period and before the grace period premium payment is paid the death benefit proceeds will still be payable to the beneficiary although the amount paid will reflect a reduction for the monthly deductions due on or before the date of the insureds death and for any policy debt see amount of death benefit page  if the grace period premium payment has not been paid before the grace period ends your policy will lapse it will have no value and no benefits will be payable see reinstatement page  a

with us charges and deductions premium expense charge a sales charge is deducted from each premium payment this charge is equal to  of premiums paid through policy year  and  thereafter it is

premium tax charge reimburses union central for premium taxes associated with the policies and related administrative costs the stated premium tax rates in the jurisdictions in which union central does business range from  to  and the jurisdiction in which a policy is issued may impose no premium tax or a premium tax higher or lower than the charge deducted under the policies monthly deduction on each monthly date union central will deduct from the account value the monthly deductions due commencing as of the policy date your policy date is the date used to determine your monthly date the monthly deduction consists of  cost of insurance charges cost of insurance charge  the monthly administrative charge the administrative charge and  any charges for supplemental andor rider benefits supplemental andor rider benefit charges as described below the monthly deduction is deducted from the subdivisions and from the guaranteed account pro rata on the basis of the portion of account value in each cost of insurance charge this charge compensates union central for the expense of providing insurance coverage the charge depends on a number of variables and therefore will vary from policy to policy and from monthly date to monthly date for any policy the cost of insurance on a monthly date is calculated by multiplying the current cost of insurance rate for the insured by the risk amount under the policy for that monthly date the risk amount for a monthly date is the difference between the death benefit see page  for a policy as adjusted to take into account assumed monthly earnings at an annual rate of  and the account value as calculated on that monthly date less any monthly deduction due on that date except the cost of insurance the current cost of insurance rate for a policy is based on the age at issue sex and rate class of the insured and on the policy year and therefore varies from time to time different current cost of insurance rates apply to policies with a specified amount under  than to policies with a specified amount of  or more and in general policies with a specified amount of  or more may have lower current cost of insurance rates union central currently places insureds in the following rate classes based on underwriting standard tobacco ages  standard nontobacco ages  or preferred ages  the preferred rate class is only available under policies with specified amounts of  or more we also may place an insured in a substandard rate class which involves a higher mortality risk than the standard tobacco or standard nontobacco classes union central will determine a cost of insurance rate for increases in coverage based on the age of the insured at the time of the increase the following rules will apply for purposes of determining the risk amount for each rate union central places the insured in a rate class when the policy is issued based on union centrals underwriting of the application this original rate class applies to the initial specified amount when an increase in specified amount is requested union central conducts underwriting before approving the increase except as noted below to determine whether a different rate class will apply to the increase if the rate class for the increase has lower cost of insurance rates than the original rate class then the rate class for the increase will also be applied to the initial specified amount if the rate class for the increase has higher cost of insurance rates than the original rate class the rate class for the increase will apply only to the increase in specified amount and the original rate class will continue to apply to the initial specified amount union central does not conduct underwriting for an increase in specified amount if the increase is requested by exercising an option to increase the specified amount automatically without underwriting see supplemental andor rider benefits page  in such case the insureds rate class for an increase will be the class in effect when the guaranteed option rider was issued for purposes of determining the risk amount associated with a specified amount we will attribute the account value solely to the initial specified amount unless the account value exceeds the initial specified amount if the account value exceeds the initial specified amount the excess will be considered attributable to the increases in specified amount in the order of the increases if there is a decrease in specified amount after an increase a decrease is applied first to decrease any prior increases in specified amount starting with the most recent increase and then each prior increase union central guarantees that the cost of insurance rates used to calculate the monthly cost of insurance charge will not exceed the maximum cost of insurance rates set forth in the policies the guaranteed rates for standard classes are based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables male or female smoker or nonsmoker mortality rates  cso tables the guaranteed rates for substandard classes are based on multiples of or additives to the  cso tables union centrals current cost of insurance rates may be less than the guaranteed rates that are set forth in the policy current cost of insurance rates will be determined based on union centrals expectations as to future mortality investment earnings expenses taxes and persistency experience these rates may change from time to time cost of insurance rates whether guaranteed or current for an insured in a standard nontobacco class are equal to or lower than guaranteed rates for an insured of the same age and sex in a standard tobacco class cost of insurance rates whether guaranteed or current for an insured in a standard nontobacco or tobacco class are generally lower than guaranteed rates for an insured of the same age and sex and tobacco status in a substandard class legal considerations relating to sexdistinct premium payments and benefits mortality tables for the policies generally distinguish between males and females thus premium payments and benefits under policies covering males and females of the same age will generally differ union central does however also offer policies based on unisex mortality tables if required by state law employers and employee organizations considering purchase of a policy should consult with their legal advisors to determine whether purchase of a policy based on sexdistinct actuarial tables is consistent with title vii of the civil rights act of  or other applicable law upon request union central may offer policies with unisex mortality tables to such prospective purchasers monthly administrative charge union central deducts a monthly administrative charge from the account value on each monthly date the administrative charge is currently equal to  per month during the first policy year and  per month thereafter we reserve the right to increase the administrative charge after the first policy year up to  per month the administrative charge is guaranteed not to increase during the first policy year and is guaranteed not to exceed  per month thereafter the monthly administrative charge reimburses union central for expenses incurred in the administration of the policies and the separate account such expenses include but are not limited to confirmations annual reports and account statements maintenance of policy records maintenance of separate account records administrative personnel costs mailing costs data processing costs legal fees accounting fees filing fees the costs of other services necessary for owner servicing and accounting valuation regulatory and updating requirements should the guaranteed charges prove to be insufficient we will not increase the charges above such guaranteed levels supplemental andor rider benefit charges see supplemental andor rider benefits page  daily mortality and expense risk charge union central deducts a daily charge from assets in the separate account attributable to the policies this charge does not apply to guaranteed account assets attributable to the policies during the first ten policy years the charge is equal on an annual basis to  of assets thereafter the charge is equal on an annual basis to  of assets these rates are guaranteed not to increase for the duration of a policy union central may realize a profit from this charge although union central does not believe that it is possible to allocate this charge to different risks union central feels that a reasonable estimate is that during the first ten policy years  of this charge is allocable to mortality risk and  to expense risk and thereafter  of this charge is allocable to mortality risk and  to expense risk the mortality risk union central assumes is that the insureds on the policies may die sooner than anticipated and therefore union central will pay an aggregate amount of death benefits greater than anticipated the expense risk union central assumes is that expenses incurred in issuing and administering the policies and the separate account will exceed the amounts realized from the administrative charges assessed against the policies transfer charge we currently assess a transfer charge of  for each transfer made during a policy year after the first twelve transfers we reserve the right to decrease or eliminate the number of free transfers in addition the transfer charge may be increased but is guaranteed not to exceed  per transfer we will deduct the transfer charge from the remaining account value in the subdivisions or the guaranteed account from which the transfer is being made on a pro rata basis we do not expect a profit from this charge surrender charge if a policy is completely surrendered or lapses union central may deduct a surrender charge from the account value the surrender charge includes a sales surrender charge and an administrative surrender charge the maximum surrender charge is set forth in your policy there is no additional sales surrender charge applicable to increases in specified amount however if the policy is completely surrendered following an increase in specified amount an additional administrative surrender charge may apply as described below any surrender charge deducted upon lapse is credited back to the policys account value upon reinstatement the surrender charge on the date of reinstatement will be the same as it was on the date of lapse for purposes of determining the surrender charge on any date after reinstatement the period the policy was lapsed will not count sales surrender charge a sales surrender charge is deducted if the policy is surrendered or lapses during the first fifteen policy years following the policy date the maximum sales surrender charge is  of the premiums paid up to a sales surrender premium shown in the policy the maximum amount shown in the policy is based on the age at issue sex specified amount death benefit option and rate class applicable to the insured increases in the policys specified amount will not affect the amount of the sales surrender premium or the amount of the maximum sales surrender charge decreases in the policys specified amount may reduce the sales surrender premium if the decrease is effective prior to the payment of cumulative premiums in an amount equal to the initial sales surrender premium shown in the policy we will notify you of any reduction in the sales surrender premium and the amount of the maximum sales surrender charge at the time of any decrease in specified amount that causes such reductions the greatest sales surrender charge applicable to a portion of account value is paid if you lapse or surrender in policy years one through five the maximum sales surrender charge in these years equals  of actual premiums paid up to the sales surrender premium shown in the policy after the fifth policy year the maximum sales surrender charge percentage declines on a monthly basis in level increments until it reaches  at the end of the fifteenth policy year as shown in the table below download table caption end of policy year sales surrender charge percentage                         the purpose of the sales surrender charge is to reimburse union central for some of the expenses incurred in the

office can provide advice regarding the availability of reduced or waived charges to such owners the policies may be issued to group or sponsored arrangements as well as on an individual basis a group arrangement includes a program under which a trustee employer or similar entity purchases policies covering a group of individuals an example of such an arrangement is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan a sponsored arrangement includes a program under which an employer permits group solicitation of its employees or an association permits group solicitation of its members for the purchase of policies on an individual basis the policies may not be available in connection with group or sponsored arrangements in all states for policies issued in connection with group or sponsored arrangements union central may reduce or waive one or more of the following charges the sales charge component of the premium expense charge the surrender charge the monthly charge for the cost of insurance rider charges monthly administrative charges daily mortality and expense risk charges andor the transfer charge in addition the interest rate credited on amounts taken from the subdivisions as a result of a loan may be increased for these policies union central will waive or reduce these charges as described below and according to its rules in effect when the policy application is approved to qualify for a waiver or reduction a group or sponsored arrangement must satisfy certain criteria for example size of the group or number of years in existence generally the sales contacts and effort administrative costs and insurance cost and mortality expense risk per policy may vary based on such factors as the size of the group or sponsored arrangement its stability the purposes for which the policies are purchased and certain characteristics of its members including underwritingrelated factors that are determined by union central to result in lower anticipated expenses of providing insurance coverage andor lower mortality expense risk under policies sold to members of the group or through the sponsored arrangement the amount of any reduction and the criteria for qualification will reflect the reduced sales and administrative effort resulting from sales to qualifying group or sponsored arrangements andor the reduced anticipated cost of insurance or mortality expense risk under such policies union central may modify from time to time the amount or availability of any charge reduction or waiver or the criteria for qualification charge reductions or waivers will not be unfairly discriminatory against any person including the affected owners and all other owners of policies funded by the separate account how your account values vary there is no minimum guaranteed account value or cash surrender value these values will vary with the investment experience of the subaccounts andor the daily crediting of interest in the guaranteed account and will depend on the allocation of account value if the cash surrender value on a monthly date is less than the amount of the monthly deduction to be deducted on that date see page  and the minimum guaranteed period is not then in effect the policy will be in default and a grace period will begin see minimum guaranteed period page  and grace period page  determining the account value on the policy date the account value is equal to the initial net premium credited less the monthly deduction made as of the policy date on each valuation date thereafter the account value is the sum of the variable account the guaranteed account and the loan account the account value will vary to reflect the performance of the subdivisions to which amounts have been allocated interest credited on amounts allocated to the guaranteed account interest credited on amounts in the loan account charges transfers partial cash surrenders loans and loan repayments subaccount values when you allocate an amount to a subdivision either by net premium allocation or transfer your policy is credited with accumulation units in the subaccount corresponding to that subdivision the number of accumulation units is determined by dividing the amount allocated to the subdivision by the subaccounts accumulation unit value for the valuation date when the allocation is effected the number of accumulation units credited to your policy will increase when net premiums are allocated to the subdivision amounts are transferred to the subdivision and loan repayments are credited to the subdivision the number of accumulation units credited to a policy will decrease when the allocated portion of the monthly deduction is taken from the subdivision a loan is made an amount is transferred from the subdivision or a partial surrender is taken from the subdivision determination of unit value the unit value for each subaccount was arbitrarily set at  when the subaccount began operations thereafter the unit value at the end of every valuation date is the unit value at the end of the previous valuation date times the net investment factor as described below the variable account for a policy is determined on any day by multiplying the number of units attributable to each subaccount corresponding to subdivisions in which account value is invested by the unit value for that subaccount on that day and aggregating the resulting subaccount values net investment factor the net investment factor is an index applied to measure the investment performance of a subaccount from one valuation period to the next each subaccount has a net investment factor for each valuation period which may be greater or less than one therefore the value of a unit may increase or decrease the net investment factor for any subaccount for any valuation period is determined by dividing  by  and subtracting  from the result where  is the net result of a the net asset value per share of the portfolio held in the subaccount determined at the end of the current valuation period plus b the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain distributions made by the portfolio to the subaccount if the exdividend date occurs during the current valuation period plus or minus c a per share charge or credit for any taxes incurred by or reserved for in the subaccount which is determined by us to have resulted from the operations of the subaccount  is the net result of a the net asset value per share of the portfolio held in the subaccount determined at the end of the last prior valuation period adjusted for an exdividend plus or minus b the per share charge or credit for any taxes reserved for the immediately preceding valuation period  is a daily factor representing the mortality and expense risk charge deducted from the subaccount for the policy adjusted for the number of days in the valuation period guaranteed account on any valuation date the guaranteed account of a policy is the total of all net premiums allocated to the guaranteed account plus any amounts transferred to the guaranteed account plus interest credited on such net premiums and amounts less the amount of any transfers including transfer charges taken from the guaranteed account less the amount of any partial cash surrenders taken from the guaranteed account less any amounts transferred from the guaranteed account in connection with loans and less the prorata portion of the monthly deduction deducted from the guaranteed account loan account on any valuation date if there have been any loans the loan account is equal to amounts transferred to the loan account from the subaccounts and from the guaranteed account as collateral for loans and for due and unpaid loan interest amounts transferred from the loan account to the subaccounts and the guaranteed account as policy debt is repaid and interest credited on the loan account cash value the cash value on a valuation date is the account value less the surrender charge that would be applicable on that valuation date cash surrender value the cash surrender value on a valuation date is the cash value reduced by any policy debt cash surrender value is

benefit and changes in specified amount as long as the policy remains in force union central will pay the death benefit proceeds upon receipt at the home office of proof of the insureds death that

proof see when proceeds are paid page  or if elected under a payment option see payment options page  the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary see selecting and changing the beneficiary page  amount of death benefit proceeds the death benefit proceeds are equal to the sum of the death benefit under the death benefit option selected calculated on the date of the insureds death plus any supplemental andor rider benefits minus any policy debt on that date if the date of death occurred during a grace period the death benefit proceeds are the death benefit immediately prior to the start of the grace period minus policy debt and minus any past due monthly deductions under certain circumstances the amount of the death benefit may be further adjusted see limits on rights to contest the policy and misstatement of age or sex page  if part or all of the death benefit is paid in one sum union central will pay interest on this sum as required by applicable state law from the date of receipt of due proof of the insureds death to the date of payment death benefit options the owner may choose one of two death benefit options which will be used to determine the death benefit under option a the death benefit is the greater of the specified amount or the applicable percentage of account value on the date of the insureds death under option b the death benefit is the greater of the specified amount plus the account value on the date of death or the applicable percentage of the account value on the date of the insureds death if investment performance is favorable the amount of the death benefit may increase however under option a the death benefit ordinarily will not change for several years to reflect any favorable investment performance and may not change at all under option b the death benefit will vary directly with account value which reflects the investment performance of the subaccounts as well as interest credited to the guaranteed account for an illustration of the impact that investment performance may have on the death benefit see the illustrations beginning on page  the applicable percentage is  when the insured has attained age  or less and decreases each year thereafter to  when the insured has attained age  a table showing the applicable percentages for attained ages  to  is included in appendix a initial specified amount and death benefit option the initial specified amount is set at the time the policy is issued you may change the specified amount from time to time as discussed below you select the death benefit option when you apply for the policy you also may change the death benefit option as discussed below changes in death benefit option you may change the death benefit option on your policy by notice to us subject to the following rules after any change the specified amount must be at least  the effective date of the change will be the monthly date next following the day that union central receives and accepts notice of the request for change union central may require satisfactory evidence of insurability when a change from option a to option b is made the specified amount after the change is effected will be equal to the specified amount before the change less the account value on the effective date of the change when a change from option b to option a is made unless requested by notice to us the specified amount after the change will be equal to the specified amount before the change is effected and the death benefit will be reduced by the account value on the effective date of the change changes in specified amount you may request a change in the specified amount by notice to us subject to the following rules if a change in the specified amount would result in total premiums paid exceeding the premium limitations prescribed under current tax law to qualify your policy as a life insurance contract union central will refund promptly to the owner the amount of such excess above the premium limitations the minimum amount of any decrease in specified amount is  and any decrease in specified amount will become effective on the monthly date next following the date that notice requesting the decrease is received and approved by us union central reserves the right to decline a requested decrease in the specified amount if compliance with the guideline premium limitations under current tax law resulting from this decrease would result in immediate termination of the policy or if to effect the requested decrease payments to the owner would have to be made from the accumulated value for compliance with the guideline premium limitations and the amount of such payments would exceed the cash surrender value under the policy decreasing the specified amount of the policy may have the effect of decreasing monthly cost of insurance charges any increase in the specified amount must be at least  unless the increase is effected pursuant to a rider providing for automatic increases in specified amount and an application must be submitted any increase that is not guaranteed by rider will require satisfactory evidence of insurability and must meet union centrals underwriting rules a change in planned periodic premiums may be advisable see premium payments upon increase in specified amount page  the increase in specified amount will become effective on the monthly date next following the date the request for the increase is received and approved and the account value will be adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect a monthly deduction as of the effective date based on the increase in specified amount a new administrative surrender charge period will apply to each portion of the policy resulting from an increase in specified amount starting with the effective date of the increase see surrender charge page  selecting and changing the beneficiary you select one or more beneficiaryies in your application you may later change the beneficiaryies in accordance with the terms of the policy the primary beneficiary or if the primary beneficiary is not living the contingent beneficiary is the person entitled to receive the death benefit proceeds under the policy if the insured dies and there is no surviving beneficiary the owner or the estate of the owner will be the beneficiary if a beneficiary is designated as irrevocable then the beneficiarys consent must be obtained to change the beneficiary cash benefits loans after the first policy year and while the insured is living and provided the policy is not in the grace period you may borrow against your policy at any time by submitting notice to the home office in certain states loans may also be available during the first policy year the minimum amount of any loan request is  subject to state regulation the maximum loan amount is equal to the sum of  of the variable account plus  of the guaranteed account less any surrender charges that would be applicable on the effective date of the loan less loan interest to the annual date outstanding loans reduce the amount available for new loans loans will be processed as of the date your notice is received and approved loan proceeds generally will be sent to you within seven calendar days see when proceeds are paid page  and payments from the guaranteed account page  interest each year union central will set the annual loan interest rate the rate will never be more than the maximum permitted by law and will not be changed more frequently than once per year the rate for a policy year may not exceed the greater of i the published monthly average for the calendar month ending two months before the annual date at the beginning of the policy year or ii the guaranteed minimum interest rate applicable to the guaranteed account plus  the published monthly average means moodys corporate bond yield average  monthly average corporates as published by moodys investor service inc or any successor to that service or if the average is no longer published a substantially similar average established by regulation issued by the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered if the maximum annual loan interest rate for a policy year is at least  higher than the rate set for the previous policy year we may increase the rate to no more than that limit if the maximum limit for a policy year is at least  lower than the rate set for the previous policy year we will reduce the rate to at least that limit union central will notify owners of the initial rate of interest when a loan is made we will notify the owner at least thirty days in advance of any increase in the annual loan interest rate applicable to any outstanding loan interest is due and payable at the end of each policy year while a loan is outstanding if interest is not paid when due the amount of the interest is added to the loan and becomes part of the outstanding loan policy debt outstanding loans including unpaid interest added to the loan plus accrued interest not yet due equals the policy debt loan collateral when a policy loan is made an amount sufficient to secure the loan is transferred out of the variable account and the guaranteed account and into the policys loan account thus a loan will have no immediate effect on the account value but other policy values such as the cash surrender value and the death benefit proceeds will be reduced immediately by the amount transferred to the loan account this transfer is made against the account value in each subdivision and the guaranteed account in proportion to the account value in each on the effective date of the loan unless the owner specifies that transfers be made from specific subdivisions an amount of account value equal to any due and unpaid loan interest which exceeds interest credited to the loan account will also be transferred to the loan account on each annual date such interest will be transferred from each subdivision and the guaranteed account in the same proportion that account value in each subdivision and the guaranteed account bears to the total unloaned account value the loan account will be credited with interest at an effective annual rate of not less than the annual loan interest rate less  during the first ten policy years and  thereafter thus the maximum net cost of a loan per year is  during the first ten policy years and  thereafter the net cost of a loan is the difference between the rate of interest charged on policy loans and the amount credited on the equivalent amount held in the loan account union central will determine the rate of interest to be credited to the loan account in its sole discretion and the rate may change from time to time loan repayment effect if not repaid you may repay all or part of your policy debt at any time while the insured is living and the policy is in force loan repayments must be sent to the home office and will be credited as of the date received the owner may give us notice that a specific unscheduled premium made while a loan is outstanding is to be applied as a loan repayment loan repayments unlike unscheduled premiums are not subject to premium expense charges we will apply any planned periodic premiums and any unscheduled premiums without notice as premium payments when a loan repayment is made account value in the loan account in an amount equivalent to the repayment is transferred from the loan account to the subdivisions and the guaranteed account thus a loan repayment will have no immediate effect on the account value but other policy values such as the cash surrender value will be increased immediately by the amount of the loan repayment amounts will be transferred to the subdivisions and the guaranteed account in accordance with the owners current net premium allocation instructions if the death benefit becomes payable while a loan is outstanding the policy debt will be deducted in calculating the death benefit proceeds if on a monthly date the cash value less any policy debt the cash surrender value exceeds the amount of the monthly deduction due for the following policy month the policy will be in default you and any assignee of record will be sent notice of the default you will have a day grace period to submit a sufficient payment to avoid termination of coverage under the policy the notice will specify the amount that must be repaid to prevent termination effect of policy loan a loan whether or not repaid will have a permanent effect on the death benefit and policy values because the investment results of the subaccounts of the separate account and current interest rates credited on account value in the guaranteed account will apply only to the nonloaned portion of the account value the longer the loan is outstanding the greater the effect is likely to be depending on the investment results of the subaccounts or credited interest rates for the guaranteed account while the loan is outstanding the effect could be favorable or unfavorable loans may increase the potential for lapse if investment results of the subaccounts are less than anticipated also loans could particularly if not repaid make it more likely than otherwise for a policy to terminate see tax considerations page  for a discussion of the tax treatment of policy loans and the adverse tax consequences if a policy lapses with loans outstanding in addition if your policy is a modified endowment contract loans may be currently taxable and subject to a  penalty tax surrendering the policy for cash surrender value you may surrender your policy at any time for its cash surrender value by submitting notice to the home office union central may require return of the policy a surrender charge may apply see surrender charges page  a surrender request will be processed as of the date your notice and all required documents are received payment will generally be made within seven calendar days see when proceeds are paid page  and payments from the guaranteed account page  the cash surrender value may be taken in one lump sum or it may be applied to a payment option acceptable to you and to us see payment options page  your policy will terminate and cease to be in force if it is surrendered it cannot later be reinstated a surrender may result in adverse tax consequences and if your policy is a modified endowment contract may also trigger a  penalty tax see tax considerations page  partial cash surrenders you may make partial cash surrenders under your policy at any time subject to the conditions below you must submit notice to the home office each partial cash surrender must be at least  the partial surrender amount may not exceed the cash surrender value there is no fee or charge imposed on a partial cash surrender as of the date union central receives notice of a partial cash surrender request the cash value will be reduced by the partial cash surrender amount unless the owner requests that a partial cash surrender be deducted from specified subdivisions the partial cash surrender amount will be deducted from your account value in the subdivisions and in the guaranteed account prorata in proportion to the account value in each if death benefit option a is in effect union central will reduce the specified amount by the partial cash surrender amount union central may reject a partial cash surrender request if the partial cash surrender would reduce the specified amount below  or if the partial cash surrender would cause the policy to fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under applicable tax laws as interpreted by union central partial cash surrender requests will be processed as of the date notice is received by us and generally will be paid within seven calendar days see when proceeds are paid page  and payments from the guaranteed account page  a partial cash surrender may result in adverse tax consequences and if your policy is a modified endowment contract may also trigger a  penalty tax see tax considerations page  maturity benefit the maturity date is generally the insureds age  if the policy is still in force on the maturity date the maturity benefit will be paid to you the maturity benefit is equal to the cash surrender value on the maturity date payment options surrender proceeds and death benefit proceeds under the policy are generally payable in a lump sum we may offer alternative payment options owners or beneficiaries should contact union central or their union central agent for information regarding payment options that may be available at the time of payment illustrations of account values cash surrender values death benefits and accumulated premium payments the following tables have been prepared to illustrate hypothetically how certain values under a policy may change with investment performance over an extended period of time the tables illustrate how account values cash surrender values and death benefits under a policy covering an insured of a given age on the issue date would vary over time if periodic planned premiums were paid annually and the return on the assets in the each of the portfolios were an assumed uniform gross annual rate of   and  the values would be different from those shown if the returns averaged   or  but fluctuated over and under those averages throughout the years shown the tables also show planned periodic premiums accumulated at  interest compounded annually the hypothetical investment rates of return are illustrative only and should not be deemed a representation of past or future investment rates of return actual rates of return for a particular policy may be more or less than the hypothetical investment rates of return and will depend on a number of factors including the investment allocations made by an owner and prevailing rates these illustrations assume that net premiums are allocated equally among the subdivisions available under the policy and that no amounts are allocated to the guaranteed account the illustrations reflect the fact that the net investment return on the assets held in the subaccounts is lower than the gross after tax return of the selected portfolios the tables assume an average annual expense ratio of  of the average daily net assets of the portfolios available under the policies this average annual expense ratio is based on i the expense ratios of each of the portfolios except the templeton international fund class  for the last fiscal year

conditions specified in the rider we will make the accelerated benefits rider available to you only if  your state insurance department has approved the rider and  the availability of the rider will not in union centrals view jeopardize the qualification of the policy as life insurance under federal income tax law however union central may determine not to offer the benefit or may offer a substantially different benefit to the extent that we deem advisable in light of future clarification or interpretation of applicable federal income tax law if the accelerated benefit rider is offered it is expected to provide that if the insured is diagnosed as terminally ill as defined in the rider you may request an accelerated payment of the policys death benefit the payment may be subject to discounting and charges payment will be subject to evidence satisfactory to union central you should consult your tax adviser before you request accelerated payment additional rules and limits apply to these supplemental andor rider benefits not all such benefits may be available at any time and in any given state and supplemental andor rider benefits in addition to those listed above may be made available please ask your union central agent for further information or contact the home office participating the policy is issued on a participating basis and as such is eligible to share in union centrals profits and surplus to the extent determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion union central does not currently anticipate that the policies will participate in profits or surplus in the foreseeable future state variations certain policy features including the free look incontestability and suicide provisions are subject to state variation the owner should read his or her policy carefully to determine whether any variations apply in the state in which the policy is issued tax considerations the following summary provides a general description of the federal income tax considerations associated with the policy and does not purport to be complete or to cover all situations this discussion is not intended as tax advice counsel or other competent tax advisers should be consulted for more complete information this discussion is based upon union centrals understanding of the present federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted by the internal revenue service the service no representation is made as to the likelihood of continuation of the present federal income tax laws or of the current interpretations by the internal revenue service tax status of the policy section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code sets forth a definition of a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes although the secretary of the treasury the treasury is authorized to prescribe regulations implementing section  while proposed regulations and other interim guidance has been issued final regulations have not been adopted in short guidance as to how section  is to be applied is limited if a policy were determined not to be a life insurance contract for purposes of section  such policy would not provide the tax advantages normally provided by a life insurance policy with respect to a policy issued on a standard basis union central believes that such a policy should meet the section  definition of a life insurance contract with respect to a policy that is issued on a substandard basis ie a premium class with extra rating involving higher than standard mortality risk there is less guidance in particular as to how the mortality and other expense requirements of section  are to be applied in determining whether such a policy meets the section  definition of a life insurance contract thus it is not clear whether or not a policy issued on a substandard basis would satisfy section  particularly if the owner pays the full amount of premiums permitted under the policy if it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy section  union central may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to attempt to cause such a policy to comply with section  for these reasons union central reserves the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt to qualify it as a life insurance contract under section  section h of the code requires that the investments of each of the subaccounts must be adequately diversified in accordance with treasury regulations in order for the policy to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the code discussed above the subaccounts through the portfolios intend to comply with the diversification requirements prescribed in treas reg section  which affect how the portfolios assets are to be invested union central believes that the subaccounts will thus meet the diversification requirements and union central will monitor continued compliance with this requirement in certain circumstances owners of variable life insurance contracts may be considered the owners for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the subaccounts used to support their contracts in those circumstances income and gains from the subaccount assets would be includible in the variable contract owners gross income the irs has stated in published rulings that a variable contract owner will be considered the owner of subaccount assets if the contract owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets the treasury department has also announced in connection with the issuance of regulations concerning diversification that those regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor ie the policyowner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account this announcement also stated that guidance would be issued by way of regulations or rulings on the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts without being treated as owners of the underlying assets the ownership rights under the policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described by the irs in rulings in which it was determined that policyowners were not owners of subaccount assets for example an owner has additional flexibility in allocating premium payments and account value these differences could result in an owner being treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of the subaccounts in addition union central does not know what standards will be set forth if any in the regulations or rulings which the treasury department has stated it expects to issue union central therefore reserves the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt to prevent an owner from being considered the owner of a pro rata share of the assets of the subaccounts the following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes tax treatment of policy benefits in general union central believes that the proceeds and cash value increases of a policy should be treated in a manner consistent with a fixedbenefit life insurance policy for federal income tax purposes thus the death benefit under the policy should be excludible from the gross income of the beneficiary under section a of the code depending on the circumstances the exchange of a policy a change in the policys death benefit option a policy loan a partial cash surrender a surrender a change in ownership or an assignment of the policy may have federal income tax consequences in addition federal state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depends on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary the policy may also be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if you are contemplating the use of a policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences you should be sure to consult a qualified tax advisor regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement generally the owner will not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the account value including increments thereof until there is a distribution the tax consequences of distributions from and loans taken from or secured by a policy depend on whether the policy is classified as a modified endowment contract whether a policy is or is not a modified endowment contract upon a complete surrender or lapse of a policy or when benefits are paid at a policys maturity date if the amount received plus the amount of indebtedness exceeds the total investment in the policy the excess will generally be treated as ordinary income subject to tax modified endowment contracts section a establishes a class of life insurance contracts designated as modified endowment contracts which applies to life insurance contracts entered into or materially changed after june   the rules relating to whether a policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract are extremely complex and cannot be fully described in the limited confines of this summary in general a policy will be a modified endowment contract if the accumulated premiums paid at any time during the first seven policy years exceeds the sum of the net level premiums which would have been paid on or before such time if the policy provided for paidup future benefits after the payment of seven level annual premiums a policy may also become a modified endowment contract after a material change the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change generally depends upon the relationship of the death benefit and account value at the time of such change and the additional premiums paid in the seven years following the material change due to the policys flexibility classification as a modified endowment contract will depend on the individual circumstances of each policy in view of the foregoing a current or prospective owner should consult with a competent tax advisor to determine whether a policy transaction will cause the policy to be treated as a modified endowment contract union central has established procedures for monitoring premium payments made under the policies and for making efforts to notify you on a timely basis if your policy is in jeopardy of becoming a modified endowment contract due to the payment of premiums if acceptance of a premium paid would in union centrals view cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract then to the extent feasible union central will not accept that portion of the premium that would cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract unless the owner confirms in writing the owners intent to convert the policy to a modified endowment contract union central may return that portion of the payment pending receipt of instructions from the owner distributions from policies classified as modified endowment contracts policies classified as modified endowment contracts will be subject to the following tax rules first all distributions including distributions upon surrender and partial cash surrender from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the account value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy described below at such time second loans taken from or secured by such a policy are treated as distributions from the policy and taxed accordingly past due loan interest that is added to the loan amount will be treated as a loan third a  percent additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan is made on or after the owner attains age  is attributable to the owners becoming disabled or is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the owner and the owners beneficiary if a policy becomes a modified endowment contract after it is issued distributions made during the policy year in which it becomes a modified endowment contract distributions in any subsequent policy year and distributions within two years before the policy becomes a modified endowment contract will be subject to the tax treatment described above this means that a distribution from a policy that is not a modified endowment contract could later become taxable as a distribution from a modified endowment contract distributions from policies not classified as modified endowment contracts distributions from a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are generally treated as first recovering the investment in the policy described below and then only after the return of all such investment in the policy as distributing taxable income an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the owner in order for the policy to continue complying with the section  definitional limits such a cash distribution will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are not treated as distributions instead such loans are treated as indebtedness of the owner finally neither distributions including distributions upon surrender nor loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are subject to the  percent additional income tax rule policy loan interest interest paid on any loan under a policy is generally not deductible a qualified tax adviser should be consulted before deducting any policy loan interest investment in the policy investment in the policy means i the aggregate amount of any premiums or other consideration paid for a policy minus ii the aggregate amount received under the policy which is excluded from gross income of the owner except that the amount of any loan from or secured by a policy that is a modified endowment contract to the extent such amount is excluded from gross income will be disregarded plus iii the amount of any loan from or secured by a policy that is a modified endowment contract to the extent that such amount is included in the gross income of the owner multiple policies all modified endowment contracts that are issued by union central or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one modified endowment contract for purposes of determining the amount includible in an owners gross income under section e of the code possible charge for union centrals taxes at the present time union central makes no charge for any federal state or local taxes other than the charge for state premium taxes that it incurs that may be attributable to the subaccounts or to the policies union central however reserves the right in the future to make additional charges for any such tax or other economic burden resulting from the application of the tax laws that it determines to be properly attributable to the subaccounts or to the policies owners will be notified in advance of the imposition of any such charges for taxes if any tax charges are made in the future they will be accumulated daily and transferred from the applicable subaccount to union centrals general account any investment earnings on tax charges accumulated in a subaccount will be retained by union central other information about the policies and union central sale of the policies the policies will be offered to the public on a continuous basis and we do not anticipate discontinuing the offering of the

useful life of the improvements deposit funds the liability for deposit funds is generally established at the policyholders accumulated cash values plus amounts provided for guaranteed interest policy claims policy claim reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported claims incurred in addition a claim adjustment expense reserve is held to account for the expenses associated with administering these claims the reserves for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses the claim adjustment expense reserve is estimated using statistical analyses these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency although some variability is inherent in such estimates management believes that the reserves for claims and claim related expenses are adequate the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known and such adjustments are included in current operations dividends to policyholders union centrals dividend liability is the amount estimated to have accrued to policyholders as of each year end manhattan lifes

policy liabilities revenues benefits and expenses traditional insurance products traditional insurance products include those products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist primarily of whole life insurance policies term insurance policies and disability income policies premiums for traditional products are recognized as revenue when due the liability for future policy benefits for participating traditional life is computed using a net level premium method and the guaranteed mortality and dividend fund interest the mortality and interest assumptions are equivalent to statutory assumptions the liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses for nonparticipating traditional life policies and disability income policies are generally computed using a net level premium method and assumptions for investment yields morbidity and withdrawals based principally on company experience projected at the time of policy issue with provision for possible and adverse deviations interest assumptions for participating traditional life reserves for all policies ranged from  to  for the years ended  and  the costs of acquiring new traditional business principally commissions certain policy issue and underwriting expenses such as medical examination and inspection report fees and certain agency expenses all of which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable through future gross premiums such nonparticipating deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the anticipated premium paying period of the related policies generally not to exceed  years using assumptions consistent with those used to develop policy benefit reserves for participating life insurance products deferred policy acquisition costs are being amortized in proportion to estimated gross margins of the related policies gross margins are determined for each issue year and are equal to premiums plus investment income less death claims surrender benefits administrative costs policyholder dividends and the increase in reserve for future policy benefits the future investment yields are assumed to range from  to  for the years ended  and  changes in dividend payouts are assumed with changes in yields universal life and other interest sensitive products interest sensitive products include universal life and single premium whole life products they are distinguished by the existence of a separately definable fund that is credited with interest and from which any policy charges are taken revenues for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance policy administration charges and surrender charges that have been assessed against policyholder account balances during the period benefit reserves for universal life and other interest sensitive products are computed in accordance with the retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges policy benefits that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances and interest credited to account balances interest crediting rates ranged from  to  for the years ended  and  the cost of acquiring universal life and other interest sensitive products principally commissions certain policy issue and underwriting expenses such as medical examination and inspection report fees and certain agency expenses all of which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable through future estimated gross profits acquisition costs for universal life and other interest sensitive products are amortized over the life of the policies in proportion to the present value of expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment mortality and expense margins the amortization is adjusted retrospectively when estimates of current or future gross profits including the impact of investment gains and losses to be realized from a group of products are revised amounts assessed policyholders that represent revenue for services to be provided in future periods are reported as unearned revenue and recognized in income over the life of the policies using the same assumptions

of the extent of such interest further the laws applicable to manhattan life do not provide for its voluntary liquidation or dissolution the company may only be liquidated under the supervision of the new york superintendent of insurance in the event of insolvency in such a liquidation or dissolution the entire assets of manhattan life would be used to satisfy claims of creditors and policyholders and there would be no statutory unassigned surplus for distribution to the holders of the guarantee capital shares accordingly in the opinion of counsel to manhattan life no unqualified legal opinion can be rendered as to the degree if any to which the holders of the guarantee capital shares would be entitled to participate in any current or liquidating distribution of unassigned surplus however in the view of such counsel if there should occur a liquidation or other windingup of manhattan lifes business in which assets exceeded liabilities on policies and the claims of other creditors or if there should occur a partial distribution of surplus in the absence of such a liquidation or windingup although there are reasonable arguments which could be made to the effect that the entire

is variable life insurance the insurance industry has introduced different types of insurance to meet consumer needs for example universal life insurance was created to provide a solution for many of the perceived shortcomings of whole life insurance and term life insurance see “what is universal life insurance” when consumers demanded even more changes from the life insurance industry it responded with variable life insurance and the concept of investment control whereas whole life insurance provides fixed rates of return on the account value at rates determined by the insurance company variable life insurance provides the policyholder with investment discretion over the account value portion of the policy if you own a variable life policy you may allocate your account value among a variety of investment subaccounts the premiums you pay are fixed throughout the life of the contract while the performance of your chosen subaccounts determines the growth of your account value and can also determine the value of your death benefit there are usually several subaccount options to choose from including stock bond and fixedinterest options you can allocate your account value as you see fit and you can be as conservative or aggressive as you wish a possible disadvantage is that the premiums of a variable life insurance policy generally are fixed and cannot be adjusted if your financial situation changes a variable life policy does provide you with a guaranteed death benefit if your subaccounts perform poorly the death benefit could decline but never below a defined level specified in the policy of course any guarantees are contingent on the financial strength and claimspaying ability of the issuing insurance company withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and are taxable if you withdraw more than your basis in the policy policy loans or withdrawals will reduce the policys cash value and death benefit and may require additional premium payments to keep the policy in force in sum variable life offers the flexibility to design your own portfolio together with the security of a guaranteed death benefit as long as you pay your fixed premiums your death benefit cannot go away this is not the case with universal life insurance or variable universal life insurance the cost and availability of life insurance depend on factors such as age health and the type and amount of insurance purchased as with most financial decisions there are expenses associated with the purchase of life insurance generally policies have contract limitations fees and charges which can include mortality and expense charges account fees underlying investment management fees administrative fees and charges for optional benefits in addition if a policy is surrendered prematurely there may be surrender charges and income tax implications there may also be additional fees on changes associated with a variable universal life policy that are not associated with other investment products variable life policies are not guaranteed by the fdic or any other government agency they are not deposits of nor are they guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or savings association the investment return and principal value of an investment option are not guaranteed because variable life subaccounts fluctuate with changes in market conditions the principal may be worth more or less than the original amount invested when the annuity is surrendered depending on your situation variable life is an option to consider if you are considering purchasing life insurance consult a professional to explore your options variable life insurance is sold by prospectus please consider the investment objectives risks charges expenses and your need for deathbenefit
