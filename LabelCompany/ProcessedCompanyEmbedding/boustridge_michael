headquarters troy michigan key people michael boustridge ceo christian mezger cfo products technology and business consulting business process outsourcing website wwwcibercom ciber inc is a global information technology consulting services and outsourcing company with commercial clients the company was founded in detroit michigan in  by bobby stevenson and two additional partners they called the company consultants in business engineering research ciber in may 0 htc global services acquired ciber contents  history  founding  0s  0s  acquisitionsdivestitures activities  references  sources  external links historyedit foundingedit ciber was founded in  by three individuals one of whom would remain with the company and guide its fortunes for its crucial first two decades of the three original founders of ciber bobby g stevenson emerged as the key figure in cibers history shaping a startup computer consulting firm into a leading national force by the 0s when the computer consulting industry was generating more than  billion worth of business a year a graduate of texas tech university stevenson spent the years between his formal education and the formation of ciber working as a programmer analyst for international business machines corporation ibm and ltv steel in houston by the early 0s when stevenson was in his early s he and two other colleagues decided to make a go of it on their own and organized ciber an acronym for consultants in business engineering and research at the time stevenson and cibers other cofounders perceived a need in the corporate world for specialized technical assistance in keeping pace with the technological advances in computer hardware and computer software the trio saw an opportunity to provide contract computer consulting services to clients lacking either in the resources or the expertise to use the promising power of computers in their daytoday operations through ciber the founders tapped into a market that would grow explosively in the decades ahead few realized at the time how important computers would become to the business world as the use of computers increased and wave after wave of computer innovations swept away yesterdays technological vanguard the need for sophisticated service firms like ciber to implement the frequently indecipherable technology of tomorrow grew exponentially although ciber entered the business of computer consulting services at a relatively early time the companys physical and financial growth did not mirror the growth of its industry ciber grew at a modest pace initially then embraced a new business strategy during the mid0s that ignited prolific growth stevenson watched over ciber during both of the companys two eras heading the company during its contrastingly slower period of growth and leading the charge during its decided rise during the 0s during cibers inaugural year of business stevenson served as the companys vicepresident in charge of recruiting and managing the fledgling firms technical staff a post he would occupy until november  when he was named cibers chief executive officer after the tragic accidental death of the ceo and cofounder richard l ezinga from late  into the 0s stevenson was responsible for all of cibers operations at first stevenson and the two other cofounders targeted their consulting services exclusively to the automotive industry establishing cibers first office in the hotbed of automotive production in the united states detroit michigan ciber did not remain wedded to the automotive industry for long however a few short years after its formation ciber began tailoring its services to the oil and gas industry as well a move that occurred at roughly the same time as the companys geographic expansion two years after the company opened its doors in detroit an office in phoenix was opened a year later in  an office was established in houston a denver office was opened in  followed by the opening of a dallas office in 0 and an atlanta office in  the following year ciber relocated its corporate headquarters to englewood colorado while executive officers circulated throughout cibers englewood facility the company embarked on the most prolific growth period in its history to that point 0sedit a year after the move to englewood and  years after its founding ciber competed in the burgeoning industry of computer consulting services as a minor player total sales in  amounted to a mere  million small change when compared with the revenue volume generated by the countrys leading computer consulting firms by this point however ciber executives were plotting an era of dramatic growth for their company during the mid0s stevenson and other ciber executives adopted a new growth strategy that focused on the development of a new range of services and the realization of both physical and financial growth through the acquisition of established computer consulting firms although the strategy embraced during the mid0s would take half a decade to manifest itself in any meaningful way once the strategy for the future began to take shape in tangible form ciber began its resolute rise to the upper echelon of its industry by the end of  when annual sales had slipped past the 0 million mark the plans formulated midway through the decade moved from the drawing board to implementation cibers expansion in 0 included the opening of offices in cleveland orlando and tampa moves that were associated with the development of new clientele in the telecommunications industry as ciber focused its marketing efforts toward telecommunications providers during the early 0s securing contracts with industry giants such as att gte and us west communications inc the company found itself occupying fertile ground in the computer consulting market not only were computers and their technology becoming increasingly sophisticated progressing at a pace that demanded the help of experts such as cibers consultants but the shifting dynamics of the corporate world also favored companies like ciber the early years of the 0s were marked by a national economic recession that forced many of the countrys corporations to alter their business strategies as business declined and profit margins shrank downsizing became the mantra of business leaders from coast to coast payroll was trimmed entire departments were cut from corporate budgets and as a consequence many companies found themselves lacking the resources and skills to perform certain tasks inhouse creating a greater need for the specialized services offered by ciber to meet this demand ciber contracted out specialists to help the nations largest corporations complete computer projects and cope with hardware and software problems as they arose ciber consultants wrote and maintained software that performed a host of chores including inventory control accounts payable and customer support although the conditions were ripe for rapid growth as the 0s began cibers stature at the start of the decade prohibited it to a certain degree from capturing a sizable share of the computer consulting market the company was too small to realize the growth potential that surrounded it mac j slingerlend who joined the company in  as executive vicepresident and chief financial officer before being named president and chief operating officer in  reflected on cibers diminutive size years after the company had grown into a genuine national contender noting we wanted to be a survivor we were the smallest national player and we needed to get larger quickly0 0sedit getting larger quickly ranked as cibers chief objective during the first half of the 0s engendering a period of growth that lifted the companys revenue volume from the  million recorded when slingerlend joined the company to more than 0 million by the time he was promoted to the twin posts of president and chief operating officer growth was achieved largely by purchasing established computer consulting firms as ciber embarked on an acquisition program that ranked it as the most active computer consulting acquirer in the nation during the first half of the 0s more than a dozen acquisitions were completed in six years time adding more than 0 million to the companys revenue base and greatly increasing the coloradobased firms national presence equally as important as the growth achieved through acquisition was the added expertise ciber gained by swallowing up established computer consulting firms during the 0s the push was on to grow larger quickly and to gain personnel that would enable ciber to tackle more complex projects instead of just writing programs tailored to the specifications of its clients ciber executives were endeavoring to create a consulting firm that could identify problems and provide solutions a transformation that would propel the company into the market for highermargin services the majority of the acquisitions that helped ciber expand its services and broaden its national presence were completed after the companys initial public offering of stock in march  once the company converted to public ownership stevenson retained control of more than 0 percent of the companys shares acquisitions followed in steady succession in june  ciber acquired all of the business operations of millioninsales cpu inc for approximately 0 million based in rochester new york cpu operated as a computer consulting firm employing 0 consultants in six branch offices and served clients such as northern telecom and xerox corporation the cpu acquisition was cibers fifth of the decade and by far the largest in the coming two years as expansion picked up pace annual sales more than doubled and the companys net income inflated by the move into more complex highermargin services nearly quadrupled following the cpu acquisition ciber purchased holmdel new jerseybased interface systems inc a systemsconsulting firm with  consultants and  million in annual revenue interface systems was acquired in january  and was followed by the may  acquisition of spencer  spencer systems inc a consultant millioninsales computer programming provider with offices in st louis and indianapolis next in june  ciber reached across to the west coast and acquired concord californiabased business information technology inc a fivebranch consultant computer consulting firm with 0 million in annual sales a fourth acquisition was completed before the end of  when ciber purchased broadway  seymour inc its rochester minnesota office and its  consultants by the end of  sales had increased from the  million generated in  to more than 0 million and company executives were set to launch cibers cibr0 division a venture representative of the companys desire to provide more complex highermargin services introduced in december  cibr0 service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wideranging ramifications many software programs written between the 0s and 0s used a twodigit date format to record calendar dates thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after  pm december   without the ability to recognize  as the beginning of the new century computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control invoices interest payments pension payments contract expirations license and lease renewals and myriad other tasks would generate false reports create computer bugs and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns all under the presumption that  signified the year  cibers cibr0 division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the 0s at the time cibr0 service was being introduced ciber employed roughly  consultants and operated  branch offices scattered throughout the country more than half of the companys sales was derived from 0 clients including industry stalwarts such as american express company att ford motor company ibm mci telecommunications mellon bank monsanto corp us west communications inc and xerox
