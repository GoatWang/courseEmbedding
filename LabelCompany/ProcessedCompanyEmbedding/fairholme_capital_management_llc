bradstreet inc  all rights reserved prepare — fairholme capital management despite claims to the contrary even the best fund managers can never predict with any certainty what the future holds since fortunetelling is not a viable option we must be prepared to react to whatever reality comes our wayfairholme views market crashes panics and downturns as opportunities to buy more of the companies we love at fire sale prices the only way to exploit these opportunities is to have cash on handopportunities to buy companies at bargain prices arise suddenly and unexpectedly a lawsuit criminal probe industrial accident or recession may send a companys shares into a tailspin in such a case and if the company is otherwise sound we may look beyond the fear and buy as aggressively as others sell often the price drop is a kneejerk overreaction artificially compounded by pessimism and algorithmic sell orders fairholme believes that maintaining a cash cushion may give us the peace of mind to ride out downturns a lack of cash may sometimes force us to sell our holdings into a very soft market which may further depress the prices of these holdingsnaysayers argue that holding a large amount of cash that yields nearly nothing is foolish and perhaps it is  until it isnt on all counts we think its better to have cash and not need it rather than to need it and not have it investors who criticize hoarding large amounts of cash in good times may want to reflect upon that longneglected investment treatise aesops the ant and the grasshopper
