supplemental information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  each trust is organized as a massachusetts business trust or a delaware statutory trust and is registered under the act as an openend start printed page management investment company each trust has issued shares of one or more funds with its own distinctive investment objectives policies and restrictions new york life investments an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of new york life is a delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” any adviser which serves as investment advisor to an applicant will be registered as an investment adviser under the advisers act  at any particular time those funds with uninvested cash may in effect lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements or purchasing other shortterm money market instruments at the same time other funds may need to borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” or for other temporary purposes the funds are parties to an unsecured day  million revolving credit facility with a group of lenders the “credit facility” to meet unanticipated or excessive redemption requests  if funds that experience a cash shortfall were to borrow under the credit facility or another credit facility they would pay interest at a rate that is likely to be higher than the rate that could be earned by nonborrowing funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other shortterm money market instruments applicants assert the difference between the higher rate paid on a borrowing and what the bank pays to borrow under repurchase agreements or other arrangements represents the banks profit for serving as the middleperson between a borrower and lender and is not attributable to any material difference in the credit quality or risk of such transactions  the funds seek to enter into master interfund lending agreements with each other the “interfund program” that will allow each fund whose policies permit it to do so to lend money directly to and borrow money directly from other funds for temporary purposes through the interfund program an “interfund loan” applicants state that the requested relief will enable the funds to access an available source of money and reduce costs incurred by the funds that need to obtain loans for temporary purposes and permit those funds that have uninvested cash available i to earn a return on the money that they might not otherwise be able to invest or ii to earn a higher rate of interest on investment of their shortterm balances although the proposed interfund program would reduce the funds need to borrow from banks or through custodian overdrafts the funds would be free to establish andor continue lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with banks  applicants anticipate that the proposed interfund program would provide a borrowing fund with a source of liquidity at a rate lower than the bank borrowing rate and also operational flexibility at times when the cash position of the borrowing fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements this situation could arise when shareholder redemptions exceed anticipated cash volumes and certain funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions when the funds liquidate portfolio securities to meet redemption requests they often do not receive payment in settlement for up to three days or longer for certain foreign transactions and fixed income instruments however redemption requests for the funds normally are effected on the day following the trade date the interfund program would provide a source of immediate shortterm liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities  applicants also anticipate that a fund could use the interfund program when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances beyond the funds control such as a delay in the delivery of cash to the funds custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction “sales fails” may result in a cash shortfall if the fund has undertaken to purchase a security using the proceeds from securities sold applicants state that in the event of a sales fail the custodian typically extends temporary credit to cover the shortfall and the fund incurs overdraft charges alternatively the fund could i “fail” on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale resulting in additional cost to the fund or ii sell a security on a sameday settlement basis earning a lower return on the investment use of the interfund program under these circumstances would enable the fund to have access to immediate shortterm liquidity  while bank borrowings including the credit facility andor custodian overdrafts generally could supply funds with a portion of the needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails under the proposed interfund program a borrowing fund would pay lower interest rates than those that typically would be payable under shortterm loans offered by banks or custodian overdrafts in addition funds making shortterm cash loans directly to other funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements or certain other shortterm money market instruments thus applicants assert that the proposed interfund program would benefit both borrowing and lending funds  the interest rate to be charged to the funds on any interfund loan the “interfund loan rate” would be the average of the “repo rate” and the “bank loan rate” each as defined below the repo rate would be the highest current overnight repurchase agreement rate available to a lending fund the bank loan rate for any day would be calculated by the interfund program team as defined below on each day an interfund loan is made according to a formula established by each funds board of trustees the “board” intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which a bank shortterm loan would be available to the fund the formula would be based upon a publicly available rate eg federal funds rate andor libor plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates the initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of the board in addition the board periodically would review the continuing appropriateness of reliance on the formula used to determine the bank loan rate as well start printed page as the relationship between the bank loan rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the fund  certain members of the trusts administration personnel other than investment advisory personnel the “interfund program team” will administer the interfund program no portfolio manager of any fund will serve as a member of the interfund program team under the proposed interfund program the portfolio managers for each participating fund would have the ability to provide standing instructions to participate daily as a borrower or lender the interfund program team on each business day would collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating funds once the interfund program team has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand the interfund program team will allocate loans among borrowing funds without any further communication from the portfolio managers of the funds after the interfund program team has allocated cash for interfund loans the interfund program team will invest any remaining cash in accordance with the standing instructions of the relevant portfolio manager or such remaining amounts will be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the funds  the interfund program team will allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the funds on what the interfund program team believes to be an equitable basis subject to certain administrative procedures applicable to all funds such as the time of filing requests to participate minimum loan lot sizes and the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs to reduce transaction costs each interfund loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction the procedures for allocating cash among borrowers and determining loan participations among lenders together with related administrative procedures will be approved by the board including a majority of the board members who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent board members” to ensure that both borrowing and lending funds participate on an equitable basis  the interfund program team will a monitor the interfund loan rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans b limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each fund to ensure that they comply with the funds investment policies and limitations c implement and follow procedures designed to ensure equitable treatment of each fund and d make quarterly reports to the board of each fund concerning any transactions by the applicable fund under the interfund program and the interfund loan rate  new york life investments through the interfund program team would administer the interfund program as a disinterested fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management agreements with each fund and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services in connection with the administration of the interfund program  no fund may participate in the interfund program unless a the fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation if such approval is required by law b the fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the interfund program in its registration statement on form na and c the funds participation in the interfund program is consistent with its investment objectives investment restrictions policies limitations and organizational documents  as part of the boards review of the continuing appropriateness of a funds participation in the proposed interfund program as required by condition  the board members of the fund including a majority of the independent board members also will review the process in place to appropriately assess i if the fund participates as a lender any effect its participation may have on the funds liquidity risk and ii if the fund participates as a borrower whether the funds portfolio liquidity is sufficient to satisfy its obligations under the facility along with its other liquidity needs  in connection with the interfund program applicants request an order under section c of the act exempting them from the provisions of sections f and b of the act under section dj of the act exempting them from section d of the act under sections c and b of the act exempting them from sections a a and a of the act and under section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements and transactions applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person directly or indirectly if that person controls or is under common control with that company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” applicants state that the funds may be under common control by virtue of having common investment advisers andor by having common trustees managers andor officers  section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below  applicants assert that sections a and b of the act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to and some influence over the investment decisions of a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders applicants assert that the proposed transactions do not raise these concerns because a new york life investments through the interfund program team members would administer the interfund program as a disinterested fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management and administrative start printed page agreements with each fund b all interfund loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the fund otherwise would invest in shortterm repurchase agreements or other shortterm investments c the interfund loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments d the lending fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could obtain through shortterm repurchase agreements or certain other shortterm investments and e the borrowing fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements moreover applicants assert that the other terms and conditions that applicants propose also would effectively preclude the possibility of any fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other fund  section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing fund to repay an interfund loan could be deemed to constitute a security for the purposes of sections a and d applicants also state that any pledge of securities to secure an interfund loan by the borrowing fund to the lending fund could constitute a purchase of securities for purposes of section a of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants contend that the standards under sections c b and dj are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections a and b and for the reasons discussed below applicants state that the requested relief from section a of the act meets the standards of section c and b because any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing if the lender is another fund or the same or better conditions in any other circumstance  applicants state that section d was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies applicants submit that the proposed interfund program does not involve the type of abuse at which section d of the act was directed applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the funds or their shareholders and that new york life investments will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the interfund program applicants also note that the purpose of the proposed interfund program is to provide economic benefits for all the participating funds and their shareholders  section f of the act prohibits openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank provided that immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness applicants request exemptive relief under section c from section f to the limited extent necessary to allow a fund to borrow through the interfund program because the lending funds are not banks  applicants believe that granting relief under section c is appropriate because the funds would remain subject to the requirement of section f that all borrowings of a fund including combined interfund loans and bank borrowings have at least  asset coverage based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application applicants also submit that to allow the funds to borrow from other funds pursuant to the proposed interfund program is consistent with the purposes and policies of section f  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the investment company participates unless upon application the transaction has been approved by the commission rule db under the act provides that in passing upon an application filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of the registered investment company in a joint enterprise joint arrangement or profit sharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants  applicants assert that the purpose of section d is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to insiders applicants assert that the interfund program is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating funds and their shareholders applicants note that each fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations applicants assert that each funds participation in the proposed interfund program would be on terms that are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating funds applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the interfund loan rate will be the average of the repo rate and the bank loan rate  on each business day when an interfund loan is to be made the interfund program team will compare the bank loan rate with the repo rate and will make cash available for interfund loans only if the interfund loan rate is i more favorable to the lending fund than the repo rate and ii more favorable to the borrowing fund than the bank loan rate  if a fund has outstanding bank borrowings any interfund loan to the fund will i be at an interest rate equal to or lower than the interest rate of any outstanding bank borrowing ii be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral iii have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan and in any event not over seven days and iv provide that if an event of default occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the fund that the event of default by the fund start printed page will automatically without need for action or notice by the lending fund constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund lending agreement which both aa entitles the lending fund to call the interfund loan immediately and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral and bb causes the call to be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing fund  a fund

its total assets provided that if the borrowing fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender including but not limited to another fund the lending funds interfund loan will be secured on

program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the borrowing would be more than  of its total assets or any lower threshold provided for by a funds fundamental

total assets it must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan if the total outstanding borrowings of a fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed  of its total assets for any other reason such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions the fund will within one business day thereafter either i repay all its outstanding interfund loans ii reduce its outstanding indebtedness to  or less of its total assets or iii secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets at which time the collateral called for by this condition  shall no longer be required until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a funds total outstanding borrowings exceed  of its total assets is repaid or the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets the fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan to funds at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loans  no fund may lend to another fund through the interfund program if the loan would cause the lending funds aggregate outstanding loans through the interfund program to exceed  of its current net assets at the time of the loan  a funds interfund loans to any one fund shall not exceed  of the lending funds net assets  the duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold but in no event more than seven days loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions

and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing fund  a funds participation in the interfund program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents  the
