darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director thanks zaheed good morning everyone welcome to our first quarter conference call joining me on the call today is our president sherman who will update you on our business operations including our integration activities and mike norona our chief financial officer and mike will update you on our financial performance entering  and year two of our integration we remain very confident in the growth earnings and service potential of this combination we are well positioned in the commercial business diy import domestic independent and online channels with approximately  of our business in the fastestgrowing commercial segment the  enterprise priorities remain unchanged from  they are just to remind you relentlessly improving our base business execution and successfully delivering the yeartwo integration objectives we are building on last years progress and continue to be confident that the steps we took positioned us well as a reminder the notable successes in  included naming our goforward leadership team aligning our cultures while improving our inventory availability principally through the crosssourcing we also completed our supplier negotiations and defined our goforward product brand structure we successfully entered dallas leveraging the carquest backbone and finally we delivered on the synergy and financial expectations for the year through the first quarter of this year the cultural assimilation remains very strong the crosssourcing availability continues to drive the business and the growth drivers principally with the worldpac business the canadian business and our dallas markets are exceeding expectations in  the required next step in the companys integration is the companys people processes systems and capabilities are to form a common foundation in addition to that aligning our systems and distribution work this also includes moving to a common foundation for products pricing customer process support centers pay and benefits and the store and field leadership structure this significant work is underway and is an integral step into leveraging the full potential of this acquisition it will and has resulted in broadbased change a number of new learning curves and some temporary disruptions to our business we completed critical integration deliverables in the quarter and expected some impact to the business however the degree of impact on the base business honestly was greater than we anticipated consequently our first quarter performance was lower than we expected overall our sales grew  to just over  billion the comparable sales were up  led by commercial growth with our diy business declining modestly earnings per share on a comparable basis grew  in the quarter on top of last years  growth now our industry fundamentals remain positive including vehicles in operation gas prices milesdriven and steadily improving economy the industry benefits are not equally distributed across the country specifically our northeastern and upper midwest markets meaningfully underperformed our expectations in q principally driven by weather and some of the west coast port slowdown despite the integration workload and some weatherimpacted areas we have continued to grow our sales and our profits the integration efforts i referenced earlier had a larger impact on our core commercial business in the quarter as it experienced a sequential slowdown from q of last year our commercial business has been consistently performing at the high end or above the high end of the market growth of  to  in our first quarter we were closer to the low end of that range our sales and operations teams are intensely focused on leading the business and our customers through these changes to get this part of our business back in rhythm and we will our fourth quarter call i outlined five key integration priorities that we were focused on this year later george will provide more details and a status update shortly together these five key priorities support the overarching objective of aligning the two companies to a common foundation this significant just table stakes work is required in order to minimize the confusion with customers and position the combined company to operate more efficiently and ultimately generate the highest value from this combination as a company we made a decision to drive key integration activities aggressively from the start we believe moving faster with things like the organization and product integration will get us to a desired end state and the results sooner than a piecemeal approach i previously noted that our  integration priorities were entering a more complex phase as i called it certainly it is expected given we are undertaking the largest and most diversified integration project in the industrys history although the core business integration work is driving change in shortterm volatility in the base business this volatility will pass and the longterm potential remains strong i will conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating our ongoing confidence and the potential of the combined businesses and the opportunity to grow the company in the long term in size and scale and achieve our next target of  comparable operating margins by the end of  last year we focused on executing our integration plan with few unforeseen challenges a year later the longterm potential remains the same and we are encountering impacts of change from the integration it is a reminder that neither results nor change unfold in a linear fashion while results this quarter did not meet our high expectations we expect the business to steadily improve which is the case so far in the second quarter q was a new high point of integration change and we expect to start seeing our team settling into a sales and operating rhythms going forward we also remain grounded that we still have sizable amount of integration work ahead of us and we continue to expect some unevenness in the business this year in consideration of this mike will review this with you and also provide you with a revised annual outlook i want to finish by sincerely thanking our  team members for their remarkable commitment in supporting the changes to position our business for an outstanding future now id like to turn the call over to george sherman our president george george e sherman  president thanks darren good morning everyone first i too would like to thank all of our team members for their contribution to customer service in the quarter and putting their focus and energy into meeting our customer commitments while stretching to complete many of our integration tasks with my prepared remarks this morning ill provide commentary on our first quarter base business performance together with a progress update on our integration priorities as we mentioned in the past advance is on a path of continuous improvement and consistent execution and weve made tangible progress however when you layer on the integration that touches many parts of the organization and namely customer facing parts such as our field and sales teams its clearly not business as usual the multiyear integration plan will have a few peaks and q was at a high point with many simultaneous work streams being executed we expected our business would see some impact however it was more than we anticipated and led to sales outcomes that were below what we expect and aspire to deliver with a comp of  ill discuss the integration impact and status in more detail  turning to our commercial business as darren mentioned our core commercial business faced the most change and experienced the greatest amount of variability the overall industry is benefiting from the macro benefits improving consumer confidence and those are all net positives offsetting the industry tailwinds beyond the integration was weather impact we experienced in our core markets as we continued with high degrees of sales variability and lost sales days due to weatherrelated store closures with respect to our key customer segment our technet commercial partnership programs are designed to help our customers improve their service and grow their business we grew our technet program in the quarter high single digits yearoveryear and now have over  members additionally the vast majority of our strategic account business also grew at close to the same rate our bud penetration continues to be a strategic priority and we continued our progress with meaningful growth in the quarter turning to our diy business in  we expect to improve our diy business underpinned by three initiatives first our speed perks loyalty program weve rolled that program out to all advance stores with the carquest stores scheduled to receive it by approximately the end of q the objective this year is about achieving scale through member acquisition that translates to a yearend target of about  million members we are on pace with over  million members at the end of q the early indicators relative to increased frequency and basket size improvement from members in q are meeting our expectations the second initiative is renewed emphasis in investments and marketing toward diy customers with focus on the heavy diyer or the car guy we like what were seeing with our initial customer response with sustained awareness from advertising ramps over time and were tracking results closely lastly we continue to invest in our store team members through training initiatives that deliver a great customer experience were also working to improve the consistency and simplification of our diy marketing and how it shows up in our stores to make the customer experience simple and clear overall im satisfied with the progress we made in q with diy and the steps were taking against our objective turning to our integration we are now into the second full year of integrating general parts this year is focused on aligning to a common foundation the integration activities put pressure on the core capacity of the business in the quarter and we expected that to be the case and frankly its the only way to move forward and get the teams through the change as quickly as possible and stay focused on the endstate outcomes with that in mind id like to share a status update with you on the core integration activities were undertaking this year stratified across five focus areas first our store support center consolidation is essentially complete during the second half of last year and for the first quarter weve made the required decisions and worked through the changes to ensure we have all team members operating in their goforward roles by the end of q the team members moving between roanoke to raleigh will be fully complete after the school year and the minnesota office is set to close in july it was important to get all this done so new team members can begin ramping up the required learning curves as quickly as possible and improving operational execution throughout the year second our field operations and sales team integration is complete in q we integrated our field teams across  regions in order to build a structure with singular leadership across both brands we consider this work absolutely essential and a part of the integration that we needed to address with speed and conviction our history with acquisitions tells us that unifying teams with aligned goals career tracks and rewards allows team members certainty in their role in the goforward organization the cultural overlay between our teams has been positive from the start and that certainly continues restructuring our field sales teams is something we needed to do both for our team and our customers and aligned sales team prevents redundant sales calls and shows an aligned face to our business across the advance and carquest brands as with any field structure change of that magnitude we experienced disruptions both internally in changing reporting structures and externally from sales reps and the customer relationships shifts were now emerging from the high point of the learning curve and the focus is now back squarely on sustainable performance rhythms third now turning to our consolidation conversion and relocation work when we updated you last we have completed our early consolidation program for the first  stores which were predominantly those lowest performing stores in the chain in the quarter we converted the stores served by our dallas distribution center which includes the dallas and houston markets we are very pleased with the team member customer and financial results what is most rewarding is the ability to be successful with these conversions in a market that is so highly competitive well next be executing this program in stores served by three distribution centers in q in salt lake city san antonio and bangor maine this next wave is approximately  stores in the back half of  we expect to move at a run rate of  stores to  stores consolidated or converted per quarter starting in q the program is projected to run until mid when the carquest chain will be fully converted overall we continue to be on schedule with our plan notably unlike retail store conversions which can be simple for both customers and our team members our conversions and consolidations impact how our commercial customer does business day to day the consolidations affect commercial customers differently and require more effort and agility around the process to make sure we are not only executing the mechanics of the transition but retain the customers through the process and getting them quickly back to normal operating routines we also successfully completed the consolidation of approximately  autopart international stores in florida in q  the acquisition process to drive more efficiency and better profit outcomes these consolidations have gone well and were very pleased with the sales and profit performance the fourth priority is our product changeovers we began the work in late q of aligning the products the brands and the pricing between the carquest and advance stores this program has two components product relabels and product replacement weve completed  of our relabel program as of the end of q this involve team member capacity and focus including independent store owners and distribution center team members touching over  million pieces of merchandise we also completed the additional phases of replacing complete product lines thats more difficult work since it involves sweeping product back to a central facility setting new planograms and bringing in the new product that requires execution at the supplier supply chain and store levels that is inherently more complicated in pursuit of building the best house of brands in the industry it also involve teaching our teams to sell brands they may have competed with in the past additionally we continue price alignment work between brands and have aligned approximately  of product pricing to commercial customers between carquest and advance stores the outcome is to have one consistent set of prices in all stores across the chain naturally we have some customer reaction as we move pricing certainly in the cases where we lower pricing that impact is immediate getting the required increase in unit velocity thats needed to compensate for the price decrease is not weve been satisfied with the overall outcome and while its likely had a negative impact on both our comps and earnings in the quarter we know this work positions us correctly in the market for the long term and it had to be done our fifth key priority focus is on our systems and supply chain integration efforts looking at systems first we have completed a significant amount of due diligence on what is understandably a complex part of this integration the complexity arises largely from three areas first migrating and rationalizing the two sets of enterprise systems over to one goforward platform second continue with the carquest legacy systems and finally whenever you bring a set of systems that were designed for a private company under a public company umbrella it requires additional work to get the systems the same place as advance is from a functionality and compliance standpoint were taking a measured approach to this complex work ensuring that we focus on highvalue areas for our team and customer first last year we were able to complete several systems projects as planned to support the product changeover work store conversion work our organization conversion work and financial compliance requirements the next phase of our work is focused on getting the carquest stores advance stores and both ecommerce platforms on to a common carquestbased product catalog this is the most valuable element of customer experience and is the valuecreating element of the store system by allowing advance to offer the industrys deepest catalog were doing the backend work this year and expect to migrate the change to that common catalog in  the third major segment of systems integration is the work of connecting the carquest and advance distribution centers and stores systems into one integrated supply chain that work is also well underway and we expect to begin the process of converting the supply chains in the middle of next year concurrent with the systems work is our ongoing expansion of daily delivery in the legacy advance network at the end of the quarter we have  advance stores being serviced daily we expect to have approximately  advance stores being serviced daily by the end of the year our best estimate today is well be nearing completion of the entire chain on daily delivery by the end of  once the supply chain systems work is completed we can then finish the consolidation of the back end financial systems by definition thatll occur last and at this point we expect to be able to complete that work in late  lastly before i close id like to take a moment to share some insights as we focus on pushing forward our growth agenda as a combined company a few comments on the major ones worldpac continues to execute its growth plan at or above expectations and we continue to invest in that business and its growth including the planned opening of  new branches this year carquest canada completed the majority of the product changes last year and had no field organizational integration activities and is now driving solid doubledigit growth in local currency for the carquest canada business finally while not the core focus of the acquisition we see solid diy growth in stores where we installed the advance diy capabilities as part of the store conversions in closing what id like to convey is that we are in the midst of an operationally taxing integration year and while there have been some challenges some more than we anticipated and others that weve yet to tackle those challenges are simply part of this process and should not be interpreted in any other way the parts of our organization that are not in the midst of integration change are delivering with strength we remain absolutely confident in executing against the plan and by the future we see for our company as we work to integrating this acquisition and positioning advance for growth and industry leadership while ive gone into detail to give you a better context on what some of the challenges around the integration look like make no mistake we are moving forward every day and are absolutely confident in our ability to execute this work while building upon our core business despite facing the toughest quarter of integration we grew sales for the sixth quarter in a row as aspects of the integration move to complete status where we see a majority of certain tasks behind us there will certainly be a sustained period of execution focus to ensure that we maximize the value of the work that weve done and continue to emerge as a top commercial competitor now id like to turn the call over to mike norona our chief financial officer michael a norona  executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks george and good morning everyone id like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their commitment to serving our customers during the quarter while also navigating the change driven by our integration efforts in my remarks today i plan to review the financial highlights from our first quarter of  and provide some insights on the remainder of the year as a reminder and unless otherwise specified advance will present its financials and supporting commentary on a consolidated enterprise basis and would also discuss results on a comparable basis which excludes the impacts of onetime integration expenses and amortization of intangible assets both related to the acquisition of general parts our financial results were below our expectation in our first quarter of  primarily driven by our integration activities we expected the heavier integration efforts to impact our financial performance in  however the combination of both the volume of change and the areas of the business that were impacted had a greater financial impact than we anticipated at the beginning of the year the changes had the most impact on our commercial sales despite the softness we were able to grow our profit rate and deliver on our synergy expectations we are confident that we will work through the required operational phases of our integration and deliver the compelling financial value of our combination with gpi turning to sales our first quarter net sales increased  to  billion compared to our first quarter of  this sales growth was principally driven by the addition of new stores our comparable store sales increase of  which was led by the growth of our commercial business a  basis point sequential improvement in our diy business from q  offset by a net  basis point foreign currency impact we also experienced more pronounced variability in our commercial sales where in some cases we saw greater than a  basis point gap in our commercial sales comps in places where we shifted customer relationships versus where we had no changes this variability is part of the change and we expect it to be short term comp sales were also partially affected by unfavorable weather across some of our great lakes and northeast markets as a reminder general parts companyowned locations are included in our comp sales calculation beginning in february  sales to our independent customers are not part of our comp calculation turning to gross profit our gross profit rate dollars in the first quarter increased  to  billion from  billion in our first quarter of  our gross profit rate of  was up  basis points compared to first quarter of  this yearoveryear rate increase was due to  basis points of achieved merchandise cost synergies partially offset by cost from our new hartford connecticut dc that opened in late  turning to sga our comparable sga rate was  in the quarter which improved  basis points compared to our first quarter of  this yearoveryear improvement was the result of achieved cost synergies and lower incentive compensation partially offset by slightly higher advertising expenses related to our diy business all in first quarter comparable cash eps was  up  on top of last years  as a reminder in our first quarter last year we had a  eps impact in onetime favorable tax audit settlements our first quarter operating income dollars on a comparable basis increased  to  million and our operating income rate increased  basis points over the same period last year to  included in our operating income was  million in net incremental acquisition synergies we are pleased that we continue to deliver against our synergy expectations operating cash flow increased approximately  to  million in the first quarter versus  million during the same period last year free cash flow increased to  million in the first quarter versus  million during the same period last year our ap ratio for the quarter was  versus  last year at the end of the first quarter we had roughly  billion of debt on our balance sheet and our adjusted debttoebitdar was  times during the quarter we paid down approximately  million of debt and are progressing as planned to pay down debt with our free cash flow to get back below the  times leverage ratio and maintain our investment grade ratings we continue to measure the performance of our business and prioritize our investments to achieve growth profit and value creation our growth engine is our commercial business which is driven by the growth of new and existing customers we also see a opportunity to organically grow stores to over  locations which include doubling the size of worldpac and growing our independent business additionally we expect our loyalty program which targets the heavy diyer will drive more consistent diy comp performance through increased frequency and a stronger sales mix of hard parts turning to profit we see an opportunity to grow our comparable operating income rate to  by the end of  as context our combined postacquisition comparable operating income rate was  reflecting the acquisition of a lowermargin commercialheavy business in  through improvements and operational execution together with our achieved yearone synergies we closed out our first year as a combined company with an operating income rate of  which was approximately  basis point improvement from the postacquisition starting point this puts us on track against our next profit objective of achieving a  rate this is realistic given it considers the rebalancing of the gross margin profile of our now more commercially weighted business that has a different commercial customer including national accounts government paint and an independent business part of getting to  lies in delivering  million in cost synergies previously outlined and also includes modest profit rate improvements as we move to daily delivery optimize our current supply chain network and through our merchandising capabilities such as global sourcing we also must take approximately  basis points out of our cost structure as we transition to a lower gross margin commercialweighted business the key drivers will be reducing our ga profile in our support centers lowering system costs as we eliminate duplicate systems as part of our integration efforts and reducing variability across our store portfolio in both profitability and productivity with respect to value creation the acquisition of gpi continues to provide us with a compelling opportunity to drive shareholder returns through incremental earnings and cash flow in addition to improving our operating performance an equally compelling opportunity exists with our balance sheet we expect to deliver measurable working capital benefits from our supply chain and it systems integration work driven principally through our daily replenishment expansion optimizing our combined supply chain network and moving to one set of systems and processes the outcome of this work will result in a lower inventory investment with greater sku availability along with continued progress on our vendor terms both of which will show up in an improved ap ratio also were on pace to get back to our targeted level of  times and maintain our investment grade ratings once achieved we will revert back to our previous capital allocation strategies to drive shareholder value which includes investing in our business and deploying our share buyback program turning to the balance of the year we do expect to see continued shortterm business volatility from our integration activities given these changes were sequenced throughout the first quarter and our teams were still working through the changes as we exited the quarter the duration of the change is difficult to predict given the reality that change takes time as there is an acceptance and learning curve our teams are working through its prudent to build in the earnings miss we experienced in our first quarter and factor in some continued integration headwinds into our results primarily impacting our commercial sales we now expect our annual comparable store sales to be at the low end of the previously communicated low singledigits range as a result we are revising our fullyear comparable cash eps outlook down to  to  as part of this outlook we expect our share count to be  million shares our tax rate to be in the range of  to  and our interest expense to be approximately  million we are confident in our teams ability to execute and our revised fullyear outlook reflects our best view of the shortterm change impacts from the integration our  synergy estimates remain unchanged at  million to  million for the full year in closing our first quarter of  was more challenging than we anticipated given the degree of change that impacted our teams from the integration that said these changes were required to move to one common foundation that will enable us to deliver the full potential of our combination with gpi and we are confident in our teams ability to navigate through this change we are also encouraged by the strong performance from those parts of the business that were not impacted by our integration work which shows were on the right path i would like to finish by thanking our team members once again for their tremendous and tireless efforts in the first quarter and for what they do every day to serve our customers inspire our team members and grow our company operator we are ready for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from greg melich with evercore isi thank you your line is open gregory s melich  evercore isi hi thanks i had a couple questions mike i think youve mentioned synergies  million of net acquisition synergies is that a cumulative figure including last years first quarter or how should we think about that number and then i had a followup michael a norona  executive vice president and chief financial officer thats an incremental number greg if you remember last year we did a little bit over  million and this year were a little bit over  million and that is a net number gregory s melich  evercore isi so we should think of the  million as being halfway through to the  million you expect for this year michael a norona  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the way to think about that greg if you think about last year our synergies built so in the first half of the year last year we had about  of our synergies and theyve built throughout the year this year its going to be the opposite – its going to be the flip roughly  of our synergies will happen in the first half of the year and then the last  just because theyll be annualizing the bigger numbers from last year gregory s melich  evercore isi got it and then second question is could you remind us how many distribution centers you now have for each business or now its one business but how we started with gpi and advance and how the plan of integrating these and how many you expect to have as you move forward on that integration darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah greg good morning so in total were at  centers today weve completed a logistics network study thats going to inform us on where were going to end up from an integration perspective where we are on the journey right now is we are going to do a significant amount of upgrade work on a large number of the carquest dcs to prepare the capacity for the expansion of our conversions and in the second quarter well be in a position to start announcing where were going to be with  we obviously have a lot of work to do in different markets and thats when well come back and give you greater insights in terms of total count gregory s melich  evercore isi so this year is about fixing up the ones we have to make them as optimal and then we decide which ones to close next year is that a fair way to think about it darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director thats exactly right gregory s melich  evercore isi great thanks ill let someone else have a shot operator thank you our next question comes from michael lasser with ubs michael louis lasser  ubs securities llc good morning thanks a lot for taking my question as you get into some of these more complex marketing integration are you finding anything thats changing your longerterm view or causing you to change direction so perhaps youre realizing that some of the systems from either legacy organization just may not be up to speed and youre going to go through a big change in management process anyways so why not take this as an opportunity to bring everything up to the stateoftheart george e sherman  president michael good morning its george ill start with that one and turn it over to bill carter who is running our integration we are very committed to powering through the conversions and the consolidations and i think if you look at conversions as a starting point thats relatively straightforward work weve done it in the past we have a core competency around it we like the diy outcome that has come with much of that work the consolidations are inherently more complicated but again i think with the bwp acquisition we learned how to do a consolidation quite well a little bit more taxing a little bit more timeconsuming but we have to keep on working through this weve not seen anything that would cause us to dramatically change any of the schedules bill carter  senior vice president business development and integration thats correct both from a store standpoint and a product standpoint you heard george mention the progress were making and we continue to be on track i think the second part of your question is are you learning stuff through the integration thats causing you to change id say we learn every week we learn every month and we make tweaks were not radically changing the longterm integration plan by any stretch of the imagination but we continue to improve it over time one example that george mentioned on the call is we recognize the value of giving to our common catalogs sooner rather than later so that our availability across the network can be similar across platforms so were prioritizing that as something thats a valuecreating engine for the team member and the customer and that was a learning that we probably had three or four months ago as we were doing our due diligence and have adjusted accordingly to prioritize that is something were bringing to the front from a value creation and common foundation standpoint darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director id also say michael that were not changing the process but were certainly iterating the process so every consolidation we get a bit better so for instance if a carquest store is moving into an advance store and that base of business that theyre bringing along with them require some parts that were not in the assortment of the advance store were being more expeditious in moving that over bill carter  senior vice president business development and integration correct darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah maybe last case michael your last question is why not get everything to stateoftheart that would be hard but there will be a handful of things that will be stateoftheart by  our catalog will be stateoftheart by  and well start to experience some of those benefits as early as the beginning of next year our supply chain in terms of daily replenishment by the end of  will – the x delivery across the nation will be stateoftheart so theres more examples so were trying to balance this as george said in terms of the teams ability to kind of work through the change things that we have to power through versus piecemeal and were keeping an eye on the things that are critical to the customer relationship that should be stateoftheart by the time we get through this in  michael louis lasser  ubs securities llc okay thats super helpful and i guess what were all trying to figure out is just – with all the pieces you have in place and what youre learning theres nothing that suggest that you wont be able to close the – or at least narrow the margin gap that aap currently have with some of its peers over time so theres nothing thats really changing in the longer term and then as part of that when should we expect that – some of the recent integration hiccups are going to be less impactful and the business will perform more in line with the market thank you so much george e sherman  president hey michael its george again i dont think we see anything that would cause us to change any margin expectations as far as the work and whats behind us and whats ahead i tried to give some detail on this and ill give a bit more i think if you look at the actual work thats been done weve tried to move to a common foundation between the two companies and we see that – we mean product brand alignment pricing process getting the store support centers consolidated getting our store leadership teams consolidated in the field and then beginning some of the early consolidation conversion and relocation work if you look at that i think the product label part of this is largely behind us so again that was very physically intensive its touching  million pieces of merchandise and its essentially close to done so were emerging there if you look at the product replacement that work is still ahead of us category by category as far as pricing were nearly complete most of the pricing unification has happened and it certainly has in the major product lines i call the work ahead of us some of the cleanup work odds and ends but the major lines have now been changed thats a big change for us if youre in the field and youre working with customers and the pricing is different between an advance store and a carquest store and youre beginning to bring your customer base together that leads to questions obviously on why someone is getting a lower price than someone else and then i think when the work is done as you can imagine one of two things has to happen if we raise price its holding line on unit velocity and then if we lower prices it is getting the unit lift that we need to pay back for the pricing investment that we make so were making progress there and i think were emerging from that portion of it as well the support centers are – the work is done now bringing the teams up to speed ramping them up in terms of just their handle on their new positions remain something that takes a bit of time but i think those major elements are behind us the product lift is still ahead no question about that therell be some more work around that a little bit of pricing work needs to be done yet and then obviously the conversions consolidations will go on for well over a year and a half two years michael louis lasser  ubs securities llc this was helpful thank you so much darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah operator thank you our next question comes from seth basham with wedbush securities seth m basham  wedbush securities inc good morning and thank you for taking my question my first question is around the cadence of the impact from some of the integration changes that youre making i understand that theyre temporary and primarily in q but as youve gone through the first month of the second quarter have you seen the impact lessen and does that give you confidence that youll be able to hit your new targets for  george e sherman  president yes seth it does and i think there are markets where either the change has been limited or the change has abated if you look at our canadian business again they did this work last year their product replacement is well behind them theyve activated on it and theyre running nice solid doubledigit results in local currency if you look at autopart international business theyve been protected from most of this change and are continuing to run very nice growth worldpac is just growing and is completely isolated from this change and is running nice singledigit growth where we went into dallasfort worth on the goforward systems we have seen very good results in a very competitive market where weve begun to – where we did the work early and seth we did the bwp work well ahead of this that was the biggest concentration of carquest business in the northeast so much of that work is behind us and we like the way that weve emerged into q with our northeastern business and the intensity of the change of management is far less of a factor there seth m basham  wedbush securities inc thats helpful so the earnings revision for the year is primarily related to the miss in the first quarter as well as some pressure in the second quarter with very little change to the second half vision darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah thats a way to think about it its always – i think george really articulated well all those things didnt happen at the same time in the first quarter so some of the change happened throughout the quarter so were still navigating through the change so i think thats a way to think about it seth its always difficult to predict the exact level of change and the learning curve that the teams are going through but a way to think about the outlook is weve built in the miss in the first quarter we have lowered our sales for the balance of the year we went to the low end of our previous range if you think of a lowsingle digits in kind that  to  range we think were going to be in the low end of the range and i think that reflects what you just shared so thats kind of how we thought about  george e sherman  president but i would look at the change as is it the product brand work is it the pricing work is it the process work is it the corporate work and i think its an amalgamation its all those things and as i said some of that is behind us now so we see this abating during the course of the year seth m basham  wedbush securities inc very helpful last question for me the diy business it seems like you made some progress there can you comment as to whether or not the comps in diy were stronger in the first quarter than the fourth quarter michael a norona  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we said they sequentially improved  basis points seth seth m basham  wedbush securities inc great i missed that thank you very much darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah operator thank you our next question comes from matthew fassler with goldman sachs matthew jeremy fassler  goldman sachs  co thanks a lot and good morning two quick questions ill ask them both up at once first of all as you think about the impact of the loyalty program you spoke about its impact on sales can you talk about how that tends to impact margin and how you expect the margin impact to progress as that program ramps and then secondly if you could just update us if you havent already done so on the sales impact on the sales recapture rate that youre seeing as you close as you continue to consolidate some stores darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah matthew sorry go ahead george e sherman  president yeah matt let me start off with the speed perks program and then charles tyson will add some comments as well i think weve been satisfied with every aspect of speed perks they have a membership of well over  million here early in q and  million at the end of q we think that were on with something pretty good here we think that the program is distinctive and is the best in the industry it has been a win for us in terms of all the financial fundamentals the sales lift has been good the transaction growth has been good were seeing a bounceback effect matthew jeremy fassler  goldman sachs  co and as you think about – understand that sales work – is there just to make sure that we model it correctly is there some give back on gross margin obviously the gross profit dollars have to be doing well for you to like what you see but does the margin rate come down and does that build or is there a cadence to that charles e tyson  evpmerchandising marketing  supply chain yeah matthew its charles yeah there is an impact from a gross margin rate obviously the impact on sales and the growth were seeing from that customer segment that have joined the speed perks program has a very positive gross margin dollar impact so from a pro forma perspective when we piloted this we are exceeding our expectations from the pro forma that we set for ourselves for this year matthew jeremy fassler  goldman sachs  co great bill carter  senior vice president business development and integration and matt just this is bill just to answer the question on the consolidation results as george mentioned in his comments we completed the early consolidation program as of the end of last year that was focused on the  lowestperforming lowprofit stores of carquest we are pleased with those profit and sales results from those and we recaptured about  to  of the revenue that was associated in those carquest stores obviously some variability based on markets and how well we executed as we move into the broader consolidations associated with the market conversion plan that george outlined we expect consolidation performance to improve and be at the higher end of that range versus the lower end of that range as we work with programs that are bigger and stronger in nature to start with and we do more meticulous planning of the customer transitions as part of the larger consolidations so thats where were performing at this point matthew jeremy fassler  goldman sachs  co thank you so much michael a norona  executive vice president and chief financial officer and just as a reminder sorry bill  to  is in the commercial part of the business matthew jeremy fassler  goldman sachs  co and holistically if you include diy i understand that diy is kind of tiny for those for certainly the carquest stores youre closing darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah its not a meaningful figure it generally disperses and especially for those it absolutely disperses so it wouldnt change that number appreciably matthew jeremy fassler  goldman sachs  co got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert higginbotham with suntrust robert higginbotham  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks good morning i was hoping to get a little more color on what really surprised you in your integration process was it really that things were taking longer or were just tougher to execute or was there a piece of there being a sharper reaction if you will from your customer base and one thing im trying to get at is to the extent that you lost some share through these changes do you expect to get that back call it immediately once youre done with those changes or you think youll have to work harder if you will to win that business back george e sherman  president yeah its george ill start off with that and ask bill carter to make some comments as well i think if you look at the work again i think if theres something that made an impression it would be the cumulative effect i dont think theres any one aspect of it that was more complicated than what we thought and i think were well in control of every aspect of the integration its hard work i would call the combination the one that has made things a bit more complicated a lot of things falling into place at the same time pricing changes product changes any time we do a product replacement youre relying on execution at multiple levels including the suppliers weve had a couple of instances where it hasnt been the best first impression of a new part coming onboard because of the instock condition at the time i think when you look at the pricing work again its a multiphase challenge its not just getting the pricing unified its getting the activation around that new price once its done and that takes time getting the sales team out there into the shop to communicate that so its no one single thing its the combination of all of them landing at the same time bill carter  senior vice president business development and integration its the combination of the to answer your question specifically robert nothing took longer than we expected i think it was just tougher when it all added up in q change for our team and as george mentioned change due to some of the product and pricing changes that the team and the customer worked through so it was more of an amalgamation of them than any particular things sticking out as a surprise robert higginbotham  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and on the customer reaction darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director parts of it were terrific so if i can go back to the cultural overlay and the field alignment we asked our teams to go to  regions across the country and we combined  of our regional vice presidents come from carquest some of them come from advance they initially spoke a bit of a different language in terms of how they focus around the business and that one quarter later has meshed together very very well robert higginbotham  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thats helpful and in terms of winning back some of the business i mean granted youre still growing commercial but winning back some of the share that you presumably lost do you expect that to happen kind of automatically or will you have to do something incremental to get that back darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director i think while some of the change has been tough and lets talk about the product brand alignment uniformly we like where were going so when the work is done and when the work is behind us and we have this new house of brands that we think is terrific our team is behind it our customer is behind it and were very confident that well win back bill carter  senior vice president business development and integration and weve experienced this in previous integrations when we did bwp and we had things disruptive this year it came back over time within a year usually but not instantaneously its not going to come back next week so we feel good about the recovery it definitely wasnt nearly as bad as what occurred in some of the previous ones but that share comes back we regain that share with customers and we do it over a reasonable period of time robert higginbotham  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it thats very helpful and my second question is really on your general pricing strategy historically it seems like youve been pretty aggressive in the marketplace in commercial as you harmonize pricing is that a fair way of thinking about how youre currently going to market does price become less of a point of competition as you increase daily delivery and now have bigger muscle as a bigger enterprise darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah i think thats absolutely the case when we looked at the pricing continuum as youd expect advance was on the more competitive side and carquest was on the higher side we struck a point where we felt it was the right pricing strategy for the kind of commercial business that we are going to emerge as and that weve become and that includes x delivery benefits that includes a lot of the commercial knowhow coming from carquest that includes the carquest training institute that includes our technet programs banner programs that have come out of this partnership robert higginbotham  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from dan wewer with raymond james dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc hi thanks can you talk about the perspective of your commercial customer what they saw differently from advance and carquest in the last quarter that resulted in the market share in your commercial channel i guess weakening a bit was it a disruption in your instock capabilities your ability to hotshot a part within  minutes was it a change in the salesmen covering their account if you can give us some clarity on that george e sherman  president sure id be glad to and ill kind of give it to you from the perspective of if you were a district manager for say carquest and some of the change thats happening right now those customers working with that team will have seen some product changes clearly there have been changes in filters and in belts and in chassis and in gaskets and in batteries so brands that youve been used to selling for many years youre now in some cases selling a new one and in all cases going forward you will be so its bringing the customer along on that journey and just showing and demonstrating the quality of the part and id start it off right there i think the pricing part of it has been an impact as well where there is some interim period of time where again in a market carquest and advance have two different prices and then we have a new one going forward so for those carquest customers theyre very often seeing lower pricing and again we have to activate and sell more when that happens but thats a change some of the systems tend to change for our team along the way we try to make that as transparent as possible and protect our customers from change so from a bb standpoint theyre using the same systems that they always have so i think those are the major changes and we have changed some of our sales territories and thats another part of it where we did not want to have a customer have an advance commercial account manager come knocking on the door and then the carquest commercial account manager came knocking on the door  minutes later that appears to be disorganized and is confusing for the customer and weve changed that so we have built new sales territories with a single representative representing both brands in some cases but every customer has one commercial account manager only not multiple so in some cases its a new phase in others its the same dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc just following up on the previous question i dont understand if a commercial is now lets say doing more business with oreilly or more business with napa and perhaps advance or carquest drop down the first call list if theyre getting a good experience with your competitor why are they going to toggle back to advance two or three quarters down the road george e sherman  president well i think well have converted all of our brand work well have all of our availability in all of our brands lined up our pricing lined up ill remind you some of those of relationships go back for years and years so there might be a period of time where part of our integration is showing up in a commercial shop but weve been with these folks for a long long time and that matters darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah dan this is darren so part of the indicators i look at – because i think thats a fantastic question is that when we look at our strategic and national accounts our growth slowed a little bit in the quarter but you know what the ones that had been leading the way continue to lead the way so whether thats carmax or whether thats drivetime or others we feel really good about that when i peer into the carquest network their banner programs we grew that business in the quarter  so those tend to be some of the large bay installers and then we grew the technet customers specifically now theres only  of them but we grew those doubledigits in the quarter as well and those tend to be a leading indicator of the best relationships and we built up – or i should say the carquest team has built up a lot of great equity in terms of those relationships now we did see a little bit of a pullback on the advance side to some of that weather always events out but i think when we move the sales people you know what what happened is we are not able to give as much attention as were going through the process and what we have to focus on and what were monitoring is that quarter in and quarter out mike talked about a  basis point volatility in terms of touching customers so each period weve seen that volatility come down a little bit and what is it is that were touching customers again on a consistent basis and so thats how you win people back and then you augment it as weve said with getting the pricing right the product brands and the consistency dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc and just a real quick question for mike on your  operating margin goal for  you talked about  basis points of cost reductions i guess that equates to about  million is that going to be backloaded primarily to  or would you expect to achieve some of that  million savings either late this year or in  michael a norona  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the way to think about it dan is we really started that once we put this acquisition together our operating margins were at  last year we did some work on our costs this year were doing some work on the costs and i think youre right it will start to accelerate into next year and then well probably see the biggest change hit us in  i think weve talked about our cost before as we move to a lower cost lower commercial model we see opportunities at our support centers to take costs and make ourselves more efficient in those areas it is an area as we get rid of duplicate systems its a big opportunity and then as we improve the profitability and productivity and the variability across our store base so we think those are big opportunities and its work that – it will be very planful it will be very thoughtful and then part of also getting to  is keeping our sales going and growing the comps so thats another important dimension dan r wewer  raymond james  associates inc right great thank you darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director thank you operator thank you and our final question today comes from chris horvers of jpmorgan christopher m horvers  jpmorgan securities llc thanks and good morning so question asked – maybe asked prior but a little differently this time so im trying to dial in the impact of the integration impact on the carquest commercial business versus the heritage aap commercial on carquest there was a lot of concern that the business had decelerated all year in  and worries that something was breaking there on the integration and then heritage aap commercial did very well last year so maybe can you share some insights on carquest and the heritage aap and maybe highlight regions that didnt have as much change impact and how those businesses performed and what the lift youre seeing from daily delivery in heritage aap george e sherman  president yeah i think if you look at chris the change for the carquest commercial business i highlight one thing the beneficiary of a pricing benefit so certainly were seeing that happen and again that activation piece of getting the unit velocity back is not immediate so if you look at where thats happening more often than not lower pricing is happening in the carquest network theyre having to go catch up get the velocity to drive the dollars above where it was before there really arent many markets in the country where there is change to carquest the best indicator of that would be the bwp business and again as bill said there is a trough initially but we certainly see ourselves come out of it and build upon the business in the x markets weve been very pleased with the lift and the most recent work that weve done was lakeland florida to get the north florida on the daily delivery very happy with our outcomes in florida and then of course we have a new hartford connecticut facility that is at about  stores now and beginning to ramp up more and more bringing daily delivery to the northeast and were happy with those results too and especially the way that just recently with a lot of the change behind us in the northeast that market were pleased with christopher m horvers  jpmorgan securities llc so the daily delivery lift is basically as youve rolled more dcs and more stores its been consistent with your prior experiences darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director yeah thats correct obviously as george said weve been very happy with the impact in our lakeland facility and our team did a wonderful job in executing that without any interruption of service to our customers and were beginning to see that flow through into our new hartford facility and we will complete more of that work as we move through the year this year george e sherman  president yeah probably the most the clearest example we have is whats going on in canada right team they went through a first littlest changed doubledigit comps and all the competitive sets different but there are some pretty good competitors up there as well and the team is doing a great job worldpac continues just its a very nice business growing above our early expectations so theyre doing a nice job and the bwp market certainly less change there and theyre a leading indicator to yeah we just have to power through it and so we got to finish through the things we got to power through and we got to manage to the integration plan that we set out there darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director and ill also say that our dallasfort worth market opening has been a great example so were very happy with the results in dallasfort worth and how we entered a new market and we used something close to what the goforward model will look like we used the carquest distribution center it is on daily delivery we opened up super hubs geographically spaced across the dfw metroplex weve got a combined team there will be some change still in those markets its not entirely on the goforward plan but it opened up well and certainly we like the outcome there christopher m horvers  jpmorgan securities llc and so two quick followups so a what did your – what was the first quarter earnings below your internal expectations and b what do you attribute the improvement in the diy business to because the compares are actually tougher so was this actually the loyalty card helping thanks michael a norona  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah ill hit the first one and ill let darren get the second one i mean its real simple it was on the top line we said it the change that george put through – discussed we believe those are shorterterm impacts they had an impact on our field teams and it impacted – and it primarily came through on our commercial sales so that was really our shortfall i think we were pleased with some of the things really pleased with our synergy work and what we did there and so were building momentum there but really it showed up on the commercial sales side darren r jackson  chief executive officer  director on the diy side i think the single biggest change was the speed perks program again very happy with the membership base thats being built ill also add that we changed our marketing strategy and youll see a shift in our marketing mix more toward tv and on tv youll see them in places where car guys tend to watch tv so a carrelated show on velocity tv a nascar broadcast and were getting very very good feedback on that and i think it certainly highlights whats different about our loyalty program operator at this time i will turn the call back over to zaheed mawani for any final comments zaheed mawani  vice president finance planning analysis and
