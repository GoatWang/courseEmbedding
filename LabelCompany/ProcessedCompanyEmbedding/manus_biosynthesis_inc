world’s population will increase by more than  by  reaching  billion people crop production will need to more than double in order to feed these people and meet the consumer needs of a developing world with very little land remaining for agricultural expansion we as a society need to find ways to maximize the use of our world’s resources plants produce a variety of rare natural products which are used in our daily lives as flavors fragrances food ingredients cosmetics vitamins pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals we strive to reduce our dependence on land and resourceintensive practices by recreating natural processes through biotechnology sustainability we provide a renewable and stable supply of natural plant ingredients through fermentation which frees up agricultural land for food production access we reduce costs by more than fold allowing easier adoption and access to these natural ingredients across the world diversity replicating plant natural processes in bacteria allows us to benefit from nature’s enormous diversity without threatening natural ecosystems and existing biodiversity in essence we tap into nature without harming nature in the news  manus

natural substance derived from the bark of yew trees and as such its molecular structure is remarkably complex and accounts for its mechanism of action in  a study revealed that taxol can bind to the microtubule assembly of a cell stabilizing the microtubules which prevents shrinkage and prevents the segregation of chromosomes that accompanies slow cell division because it was derived from natural sources and was difficult to synthesize supplies of taxol were initially constrained read more events  manus bio events news previous conferences american institute of chemical engineers aiche annual
