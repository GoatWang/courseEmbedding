 the company’s board of directors the “board” adopted a dividend policy under which it intends to pay an annual cash dividend on its common stock and class a common stock it is contemplated that this annual dividend would be declared around the conclusion of the company’s fiscal year and paid in the first quarter of each fiscal year one of the key factors that will be taken into account in determining the annual dividend amount and whether any such dividend will be paid will be the liquidity position of the company in particular the borrowing availability under our credit facilitywe expect that the dividend paid under this policy in our first quarter of fiscal year  will be at least equal to  per share the board will review the dividend policy regularly and any future annual or special dividends whether such are paid and if so the amount and timing of payment will be at the discretion of the board after taking into account a variety of factors including the cash flows borrowing availability under our credit facility earnings and financial position of the company pursuant to our certificate of incorporation any dividends paid on our common stock must be equivalent to the dividends paid on our class a common stock“net income and diluted earnings per share reached record levels for any second fiscal quarter” stated jeffrey t sanfilippo chief executive officer “as was the case in the first quarter of fiscal  sales volume growth for our fisher recipe nut and produce brands continues to outpace sales volume growth for our private brand products” mr sanfilippo noted “at retail both our fisher recipe nut and our orchard valley harvest brands performed well in the quarterly comparison according to iri market data fisher recipe nut pound volume increased by approximately  while the total recipe nut category pound volume declined by approximately  at the end of the current second quarter fisher recipe nut pound share rose to a record  according to iri market data continuing fisher recipe’s position as the market share leader in recipe nuts total pound volume for our orchard valley harvest and sunshine country produce brands increased by approximately  while the total produce category pound volume only increased by approximately ” mr sanfilippo stated “the sales volume decline for fisher snack nuts occurred at retailers that do not report market data to iri at those retailers that do report market data to iri fisher snack nut pound volume increased by approximately  from new distribution gains while the total snack nut category pound volume was relatively unchanged” mr sanfilippo stated “we again saw meaningful sales volume growth in our contract packaging channel due to the efforts we made in assisting our customers as they launched new peanut and trail mix products and gained new distribution” mr sanfilippo added “the sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients channel arose primarily as a result of carrying lower quantities of inshell walnuts to sell to international customers and lower quantities of farmer stock peanuts to sell to other peanut shellers compared to the quantities of these commodities that were available for sale in the second quarter of  the decline in sales volume in the commercial ingredients channel was also attributable to the loss of an almond butter customer however we more than replaced that lost sales volume with strong volume growth for our branded and contract packaging products” mr sanfilippo stated“in addition to record second quarter net income and diluted earnings per share we are pleased to announce our new dividend policy” stated mr sanfilippo “we believe that now is the time to begin the practice of paying an annual dividend to our stockholders this dividend policy advances our goals of creating longterm stockholder value and expanding our stockholder base and is supported by our strong financial performance of course this would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees in addition our board will continue to consider the declaration of special dividends around the time of each annual meeting of stockholders” mr sanfilippo concludedthe company will host an investor conference call and webcast on thursday february   at  am eastern  am central to discuss these results to participate in the call via telephone
