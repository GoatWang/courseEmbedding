domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson  johnsons would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground ie uses

work reached a wider audience johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues particularly of the mississippi delta blues style he is credited by many rock musicians as an important influence the

february  a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker with whom she had ten children charles dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners julia left hazlehurst with baby robert but after two years sent the boy to memphis to live with her husband who had changed his name to charles spencer about  robert rejoined his mother in the mississippi delta area around tunica and robinsonville mississippi julias new husband known as dusty willis was  years her junior robert was remembered by some residents as little robert dusty but he was registered at tunicas indian creek school as robert spencer in the  census he is listed as robert spencer living in lucas arkansas with will and julia willis robert was at school in  and  the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background a school friend willie coffee who was interviewed and filmed in later life recalled that as a youth robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp coffee recalled that robert was absent for long periods which suggests that he may have been living and studying in memphis after school robert adopted the surname of his natural father signing himself as robert johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteenyearold virginia travis in february  she died in childbirth shortly after surviving relatives of virginia told the blues researcher robert mack mccormick that this was a divine punishment for roberts decision to sing secular songs known as selling your soul to the devil mccormick believed that johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a fulltime blues musician around this time the blues musician son house moved to robinsonville where his musical partner willie brown lived late in life house remembered johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist soon after johnson left robinsonville for the area around martinsville close to his birthplace possibly searching for his natural father here he perfected the guitar style of house and learned other styles from isaiah ike zinnerman zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight when johnson next appeared in robinsonville he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique house was interviewed at a time when the legend of johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers he was asked whether he attributed johnsons technique to this pact and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation while living in martinsville johnson fathered a child with vergie mae smith he married caletta craft in may  in  the couple moved to clarksdale mississippi in the delta here caletta died in childbirth and johnson left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician itinerant musicianedit from  until his death in  johnson moved frequently between cities like memphis tennessee and helena arkansas and the smaller towns of the mississippi delta and neighboring regions of mississippi and arkansas on occasion he traveled much farther the blues musician johnny shines accompanied him to chicago texas new york canada kentucky and indiana henry townsend shared a musical engagement with him in st louis in many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends he did not marry again but formed some longterm relationships with women to whom he would return periodically one was estella coleman the mother of the blues musician robert lockwood jr in other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance in each location johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere he used different names in different places employing at least eight distinct surnames biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew johnson in different contexts shines who traveled extensively with him lockwood who knew him as his mothers partner david honeyboy edwards whose cousin willie mae powell had a relationship with johnson from a mass of partial conflicting and inconsistent eyewitness accounts biographers have attempted to summarize johnsons character he was well mannered he was soft spoken he was indecipherable as for his character everyone seems to agree that while he was pleasant and outgoing in public in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way musicians who knew johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except of course for his musical talent his weakness for whiskey and women and his commitment to the road when johnson arrived in a new town he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant musical associates have said that in live performances johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions but instead pleased audiences by performing more wellknown pop standards of the day – and not necessarily blues with an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music he also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience in every town in which he stopped he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later shines was  when he met johnson in  he estimated johnson was maybe a year older than himself shines is quoted describing johnson in samuel charterss robert johnson robert was a very friendly person even though he was sulky at times you know and i hung around robert for quite a while one evening he disappeared he was kind of a peculiar fellow robertd be standing up playing some place playing like nobodys business at about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure and moneyd be coming from all directions but robertd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing and you wouldnt see robert no more maybe in two or three weeks  so robert and i we began journeying off i was just matter of fact tagging along during this time johnson established what would be a relatively longterm relationship with estella coleman a woman about  years his senior and the mother of the musician robert lockwood jr johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in he reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them and in most cases he was accepted until a boyfriend arrived or johnson was ready to move on in  alan lomax learned from muddy waters that johnson had performed in the area around clarksdale mississippi by  the historian samuel charters could add only that will shade of the memphis jug band remembered johnson had once briefly played with him in west memphis arkansas in the last year of his life johnson is believed to have traveled to st louis and possibly illinois and then to some states in the east in  columbia records producer john h hammond who owned some of johnsons records directed the record producer don law seek out johnson to book him for the first from spirituals to swing concert at carnegie hall in new york on learning of johnsons death hammond replaced him with big bill broonzy but he played two of johnsons records from the stage recording sessionsedit johnsons recordings were released by several record companies milkcows calf blues by perfect love in vain blues by vocalion and i believe ill dust my broom by conqueror in jackson mississippi around  johnson sought out h c speir who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout speir put johnson in touch with ernie oertle who as a salesman for the arc group of labels introduced johnson to don law to record his first sessions in san antonio texas the recording session was held on november   in room  of the gunter hotel in san antonio which brunswick records had set up to be a temporary recording studio in the ensuing threeday session johnson played  selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them he reportedly performed facing the wall which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer this conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the  album king of the delta blues singers the slide guitarist ry cooder speculates that johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar a technique he calls corner loading among the songs johnson recorded in san antonio were come on in my kitchen kind hearted woman blues i believe ill dust my broom and cross road blues the first to be released were terraplane blues and last fair deal gone down probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear terraplane blues became a modest regional hit selling  copies his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues was part of a cycle of spinoffs and response songs that began with leroy carrs mean mistreater mama  according to elijah wald it was the most musically complex in the cycle and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses in contrast to most delta players johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a rpm side most of johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session in  johnson traveled to dallas texas for another recording session with don law in a makeshift studio at the vitagraph warner brothers building at  park avenue where brunswick record corporation was located on the third floor eleven records from this session would be released within the following year johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived because of this there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place johnson recorded almost half of the  songs that make up his entire discography in dallas deathedit johnson died on august   at the age of  near greenwood mississippi of unknown causes several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about  miles  km from greenwood according to one theory johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted in an account by the blues musician sonny boy williamson johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband when johnson took the bottle williamson knocked it out of his hand admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened johnson replied dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand soon after he was offered another poisoned bottle and accepted it johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours over the next three days his condition steadily worsened witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain the musicologist robert mack mccormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview but he declined to reveal the mans name while strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed johnson at least one scholar has disputed the notion tom graves in his book crossroads the life and afterlife of blues legend robert johnson relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised even in strong liquor graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal and that death from the poison would occur within hours not days johnsons contemporary david honeyboy edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine since johnson would have died much more rapidly instead of suffering for three dayscitation needed the leflore county registrar cornelia jordan after conducting an investigation into johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics r n whitfield wrote on johnsons death certificate i talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and i also talked with a negro woman on the place the plantation owner said the negro man seemingly about  years old came from tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation he stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton the white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him he was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county the plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis gravesiteedit alleged gravesite with one of johnsons three tombstones the exact location of johnsons grave is officially unknown three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside greenwood research in the s and s strongly suggests johnson was buried in the graveyard of the mount zion missionary baptist church near morgan city mississippi not far from greenwood in an unmarked grave a oneton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk listing all of johnsons song titles with a central inscription by peter guralnick was placed at this location in  paid for by columbia records and numerous smaller contributions made through the mt zion memorial fund in  a small marker with the epitaph resting in the blues was placed in the cemetery of payne chapel near quito mississippi by an atlanta rock group named the tombstones after they saw a photograph in living blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of johnsons exgirlfriends to be johnsons burial site more recent research by stephen lavere including statements from rosie eskridge the wife of the supposed gravedigger indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the little zion church north of greenwood along money road through lavere sony music placed a marker at this site which bears laveres name as well as johnsons an interviewee in the documentary the search for robert johnson  suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave or potters field very near where he died devil legendedit according to legend as a young man living on a plantation in rural mississippi johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician he was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near dockery plantation at midnight there he was met by a large black man the devil who took the guitar and tuned it the devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to johnson giving him mastery of the instrument this was a deal with the devil mirroring the legend of faust in exchange for his soul johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous various accountsedit this legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by gayle dean wardlow edward komara and elijah wald who sees the legend as largely dating from johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death son house once told the story to pete welding as an explanation of johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in down beat in  other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from house and there were fully two years between houses observation of johnson as first a novice and then a master further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by greil marcus and robert palmer most significantly the detail was added that johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads there is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the robert johnson story all the published evidence including a full chapter on the subject in the biography crossroads by tom graves suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician tommy johnson this story was collected from his musical associate ishman bracey and his elder brother ledell in the s one version of ledell johnsons account was published in david evanss  biography of tommy johnson and was repeated in print in  alongside houses story in the widely read searching for robert johnson by peter guralnick in another version ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard this resembles the story told to steve lavere that ike zinnerman of hazlehurst mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young johnson the legendary crossroads at clarksdale mississippi recent research by the blues scholar bruce conforth in living blues magazine makes the story clearer johnson and ike zimmerman the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early s on his social security card and social security death notice on his funeral program and by his daughters did practice in a graveyard at night because it was quiet and no one would disturb them but it was not the hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed zimmerman was not from hazlehurst but nearby beauregard mississippi and he didnt practice in one graveyard but in several in the area johnson spent about a year living with and learning from zimmerman who ultimately accompanied johnson back to the delta to look after him while dockery hazlehurst and beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads there are also tourist attractions claiming to be the crossroads in both clarksdale and memphis residents of rosedale mississippi claim johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of highways  and  in their town while the  movie crossroads was filmed in beulah mississippi the blues historian steve cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads because robert johnson was a rambling guy interpretationsedit folklorist alan lomax who was instrumental in preserving johnsons recordings and spreading the mythology about his skill some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the christian figure of satan but also to the african trickster god legba himself associated with crossroads folklorist harry m hyatt wrote that during his research in the south from  to  when africanamericans born in the th or early th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads they had a different meaning in mind hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating african religious retentions surrounding legba and the making of a deal not selling the soul in the same sense as in the faustian tradition cited by graves with the socalled devil at the crossroads the blues and the blues singer has really special powers over women especially it is said that the blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted and so when robert johnson came back having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics people said he must have sold his soul to the devil and that fits in with this old african association with the crossroads where you find wisdom you go down to the crossroads to learn and in his case to learn in a faustian pact with the devil you sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history this view that the devil in johnsons songs is derived from an african deity was disputed by the blues scholar david evans in an essay published in  demythologizing the blues there are  several serious problems with this crossroads myth the devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore and nowhere do blues singers ever mention legba or any other african deity in their songs or other lore the actual african music connected with cults of legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral callandresponse singing the musicologist alan lomax dismissed the myth stating in fact every blues fiddler banjo picker harp blower piano strummer and guitar framer was in the opinion of both himself and his peers a child of the devil a consequence of the black view of the european dance embrace as sinful in the extreme musical styleedit johnson is considered a master of the blues particularly of the delta blues style keith richards of the rolling stones said in  you want to know how good the blues can get well this is it but according to elijah wald in his book escaping the delta johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues in contrast to the prevailing delta style of the time more resembled the style of chicago or st louis with a fullfledged abundantly varied musical arrangement unusual for a delta player of the time a recording exhibits what johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style theyre red hot from his first recording session shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the harlem hamfats but as wald remarked no record company was heading to mississippi in search of a downhome ink spots  he could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them the journalist marc myers wrote to the uninitiated johnsons recordings may sound like just another dusty delta blues musician wailing away but a careful listen reveals that johnson was a revisionist in his time johnsons tortured soul vocals and anxietyridden guitar playing arent found in the cottonfield blues of his contemporaries voiceedit an important aspect of johnsons singing was his use of microtonality these subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion eric clapton described johnsons music as the most powerful cry that i think you can find in the human voice in two takes of me and the devil blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse the range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing the songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked generations of blues writers in search of wild delta primitivism wrote wald have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show johnson as a polished professional performer johnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song a technique later perfected by b b king and his personified guitar named lucille in africa and in afroamerican tradition there is the tradition of the talking instrument beginning with the drums  the onestrand and then the sixstrings with bottleneckstyle performance it becomes a competing voice or a complementary voice  in the performance bob dylan wrote that when johnson started singing he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of zeus in full armor i immediately differentiated between him and anyone else i had ever heard the songs werent customary blues songs they were so utterly fluid at first they went by quick too quick to even get they jumped all over the place in range and subject matter short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic storyfires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic instrumentedit johnson mastered the guitar being considered today one of the alltime greats on the instrument his approach was complex and musically advanced when keith richards was first introduced to johnsons music by his bandmate brian jones he asked who is the other guy playing with him not realizing it was johnson playing one guitar i was hearing two guitars and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself said richards who later stated that robert johnson was like an orchestra all by himself as for his guitar technique its politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from henpicking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chuckachucka rhythm figures lyricsedit in the story with dick gordon bill ferris of american public media said robert johnson i think of in the same way i think of the british romantic poets keats and shelley who burned out early who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry  the blues if anything are deeply sexual you know my car doesnt run im gonna check my oil  if you dont like my apples dont shake my tree every verse has sexuality associated with it influencesedit johnson fused approaches specific to delta blues to those from the broader music world the slide guitar work on rambling on my mind is pure delta and johnsons vocal there has a touch of  son house rawness but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of delta blues—it is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville johnson did record versions of preaching the blues and walking blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style houses chronology has been questioned by guralnick as with the first take of come on in my kitchen the influence of skip james is evident in jamess devil got my woman but the lyrics rise to the level of firstrate poetry and johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output the sad romantic love in vain successfully blends several of johnsons disparate influences the form including the wordless last verse follows leroy carrs last hit when the sun goes down the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song blind lemon jefferson recorded in  johnsons last recording milkcows calf blues is his most direct tribute to kokomo arnold who wrote milkcow blues and influenced johnsons vocal style from four until late shows johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the delta he croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of lonnie johnson and his guitar style is more that of a ragtimeinfluenced player like blind blake lonnie johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual delta style malted milk and drunken hearted man both copy the arrangement of lonnie johnsons life saver blues the two takes of me and the devil blues show the influence of peetie wheatstraw calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heartcry of a demondriven folk artist legacyedit johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous his influence on contemporaries was much smaller in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners in juke joints and at saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music he also died young after recording only a handful of songs johnson though welltraveled and admired in his performances was little noted in his lifetime and his records were even less appreciated terraplane blues sometimes described as johnsons only hit record outsold his others but was still only a minor success if one had asked black blues fans about johnson in the first twenty years after his death writes elijah wald the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled robert who this lack of recognition extended to black musicians as far as the evolution of black music goes robert johnson was an extremely minor figure and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note columbia records released the album king of the delta blues singers a compilation of johnsons recordings in  which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death rock and rolledit johnsons greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death rock and roll and rock the rock and roll hall of fame included four of his songs in a set of  they deemed to have shaped the genre “sweet home chicago”  “cross road blues”  “hellhound on my trail”  “love in vain”  johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the advent of rock and roll dying a year or two later the rock and roll hall of fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony in  almost a half century after his death marc meyers of the wall street journal wrote that his stop breakin down blues from  is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in  rock music and related genresedit many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by johnson the most injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections are prominent rock musicians from the united kingdom his impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define rock and roll and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in  by columbia records king of the delta blues singers brian jones of the rolling stones introduced his bandmate keith richards to this album by johnson the blues masters recordings would have as much impact on him as on mick jagger the group performed his walkin blues at the rock and roll circus in  they arranged their own version of love in vain for their album let it bleed and recorded stop breakin down blues for exile on main street jagger in the role of turner in the  film performance performed excerpts from come on in my kitchen and me and the devil blues alexis korner who has been called the founding father of british blues cowrote and recorded a song entitled robert johnson for the party album released in  other examples of the influence he had on english blues and bluesrock musicians and musical groups include the following eric clapton considers johnson the most important blues musician who ever lived he recorded enough of his songs to make me and mr johnson a bluesrock album released in  as a tribute to the legendary bluesman it was also used in the film sessions for robert j he earlier recorded crossroads an arrangement of cross road blues with cream in  leading some to consider him the man largely responsible for making robert johnson a household name robert plant of led zeppelin referred to johnson on the npr radio program fresh air recorded in  as “robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way” his group recorded traveling riverside blues a song that drew from johnsons original and quoted a number of his songs the accompanying music video showed images from the delta which johnson often wrote about fleetwood mac was strongly influenced by johnson in the groups early years as a british blues band guitarist jeremy spencer contributed two covers of johnsonderived songs to the groups early albums and lead guitarist peter green later recorded johnsons entire catalogue in two albums the robert johnson songbook and hot foot powder sam dunns documentary metal evolution cites johnson as the great grandfather to all things heavy metal with members of the bands rush and slipknot agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music bob dylan wrote of johnson in his  autobiography chronicles volume one if i hadnt heard the robert johnson record when i did there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that i wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write

handful of old recordings available to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time in  spin magazine rated him first in its list of  guitar gods—on the nd anniversary of his death in  rolling stone magazine ranked him fifth on their list of  greatest guitarists of all time— years after he died in  guitarcom ranked him ninth in its list of top  guitarists of all time— years after he

recordings such as sweet home chicago have been used by companies and nonprofit organizations for marketing purposes sweet home chicago is played at many events in chicago problems of biographyedit the thing about robert johnson was that he only existed on his records he was pure legend –martin scorsese love in vain a vision of robert johnson very little of johnsons early life is known with certainty two marriage licenses for johnson have been located in county records offices the ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates as do the entries showing his attendance at indian creek school in tunica mississippi that he was not listed among his mothers children in the  census casts further doubt on these dates carrie thompson claimed that her mother who was also roberts mother remembered his birth date as may   the  census gives his age as  suggesting he was born in  or  five significant dates from his career are documented monday thursday and friday november   and   at a recording session in san antonio texas and saturday and sunday june  and   at a recording session in dallas his death certificate discovered in  lists the date and location of his death johnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release and efforts were made to discover his biography with virtually no success the blues researcher mack mccormick began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings mccormicks research eventually became as much a legend as johnson himself in  mccormick permitted peter guralnick to publish a summary in living blues  later reprinted in book form as searching for robert johnson later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details a revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by stephen lavere for the booklet accompanying the compilation album robert johnson the complete recordings  and is maintained with updates at the delta haze website the documentary film the search for robert johnson contains accounts by mccormick and wardlow of what informants have told them long interviews of david honeyboy edwards and johnny shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family these published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts a relatively full account of johnsons brief musical career emerged in the s largely from accounts by son house johnny shines david honeyboy edwards and robert lockwood in  the sleeve notes to the album king of the delta blues singers included reminiscences of don law who had recorded johnson in  law added to the mystique surrounding johnson representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy photographsedit the two confirmed images of johnson were located in  in the possession of his halfsister carrie thompson but were not widely published until the late s a third photo purporting to show johnson posing with the blues musician johnny shines was published in the november  issue of vanity fair magazine it was declared authentic by the forensic artist lois gibson and by johnsons estate in  the authenticity of the third photo has been disputed by some music historians including elijah wald bruce conforth and gayle dean wardlow who considered that the clothing suggests a date after johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched in december  a fourth photograph was published purportedly showing johnson his wife calletta craft estella coleman and robert lockwood jr this photograph was also declared authentic by lois gibson but her identification of johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians in his book searching for robert johnson peter guralnick stated that the blues archivist mack mccormick showed him a photograph of johnson with his nephew louis probably taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph showing louis dressed in his united states navy uniform this photograph has never been made public playback speed hypothesisedit in the guardians music blog from may  jon wilde speculated that johnsons recordings may have been accidentally speeded up when first committed to  rpm records or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting he did not give a source for this statement biographer elijah wald and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds including that johnsons extant recordings were made on five different days spread across two years at two different studios making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable in addition fellow musicians contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than  years preceding wildes hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered descendantsedit johnson left no will in  the mississippi supreme court ruled that claud johnson a retired truck driver living in crystal springs mississippi was the son of robert johnson and his sole heir the court heard that he had been born to virgie jane smith later virgie jane cain who had a relationship with robert johnson in  the relationship was attested to by a friend eula mae williams but other relatives descended from robert johnsons halfsister carrie harris thompson contested claud johnsons claim the effect of the judgment was to allow claud johnson to receive over  million in royalties

achieve success as an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners in juke joints and at saturday night dances johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime after the reissue of his recordings in  on the lp king of the delta blues singers his work reached a wider audience johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues particularly of the mississippi

october  and noah johnson born december  julia was married to charles dodds born february  a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker with whom she had ten children charles dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners julia left hazlehurst with baby robert but after two years sent the boy to memphis to live with her husband who had changed his name to charles spencer about  robert rejoined his mother in the mississippi delta area around tunica and robinsonville mississippi julias new husband known as dusty willis was  years her junior robert was remembered by some residents as little robert dusty but he was registered at tunicas indian creek school as robert spencer in the  census he is listed as robert spencer living in lucas arkansas with will and julia willis robert was at school in  and  the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background a school friend willie coffee who was interviewed and filmed in later life recalled that as a youth robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp coffee recalled that robert was absent for long periods which suggests that he may have been living and studying in memphis after school robert adopted the surname of his natural father signing himself as robert johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteenyearold virginia travis in february  she died in childbirth shortly after surviving relatives of virginia told the blues researcher robert mack mccormick that this was a divine punishment for roberts decision to sing secular songs known as selling your soul to the devil mccormick believed that johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a fulltime blues musician around this time the blues musician son house moved to robinsonville where his musical partner willie brown lived late in life house remembered johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist soon after johnson left robinsonville for the area around martinsville close to his birthplace possibly searching for his natural father here he perfected the guitar style of house and learned other styles from isaiah ike zinnerman zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight when johnson next appeared in robinsonville he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique house was interviewed at a time when the legend of johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers he was asked whether he attributed johnsons technique to this pact and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation while living in martinsville johnson fathered a child with vergie mae smith he married caletta craft in may  in  the couple moved to clarksdale mississippi in the delta here caletta died in childbirth and johnson left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician itinerant musicianedit from  until his death in  johnson moved frequently between cities like memphis tennessee and helena arkansas and the smaller towns of the mississippi delta and neighboring regions of mississippi and arkansas on occasion he traveled much farther the blues musician johnny shines accompanied him to chicago texas new york canada kentucky and indiana henry townsend shared a musical engagement with him in st louis in many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends he did not marry again but formed some longterm relationships with women to whom he would return periodically one was estella coleman the mother of the blues musician robert lockwood jr in other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance in each location johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere he used different names in different places employing at least eight distinct surnames biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew johnson in different contexts shines who traveled extensively with him lockwood who knew him as his mothers partner david honeyboy edwards whose cousin willie mae powell had a relationship with johnson from a mass of partial conflicting and inconsistent eyewitness accounts biographers have attempted to summarize johnsons character he was well mannered he was soft spoken he was indecipherable as for his character everyone seems to agree that while he was pleasant and outgoing in public in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way musicians who knew johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except of course for his musical talent his weakness for whiskey and women and his commitment to the road when johnson arrived in a new town he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant musical associates have said that in live performances johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions but instead pleased audiences by performing more wellknown pop standards of the day – and not necessarily blues with an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music he also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience in every town in which he stopped he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later shines was  when he met johnson in  he estimated johnson was maybe a year older than himself shines is quoted describing johnson in samuel charterss robert johnson robert was a very friendly person even though he was sulky at times you know and i hung around robert for quite a while one evening he disappeared he was kind of a peculiar fellow robertd be standing up playing some place playing like nobodys business at about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure and moneyd be coming from all directions but robertd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing and you wouldnt see robert no more maybe in two or three weeks  so robert and i we began journeying off i was just matter of fact tagging along during this time johnson established what would be a relatively longterm relationship with estella coleman a woman about  years his senior and the mother of the musician robert lockwood jr johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in he reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them and in most cases he was accepted until a boyfriend arrived or johnson was ready to move on in  alan lomax learned from muddy waters that johnson had performed in the area around clarksdale mississippi by  the historian samuel charters could add only that will shade of the memphis jug band remembered johnson had once briefly played with him in west memphis arkansas in the last year of his life johnson is believed to have traveled to st louis and possibly illinois and then to some states in the east in  columbia records producer john h hammond who owned some of johnsons records directed the record producer don law seek out johnson to book him for the first from spirituals to swing concert at carnegie hall in new york on learning of johnsons death hammond replaced him with big bill broonzy but he played two of johnsons records from the stage recording sessionsedit johnsons recordings were released by several record companies milkcows calf blues by perfect love in vain blues by vocalion and i believe ill dust my broom by conqueror in jackson mississippi around  johnson sought out h c speir who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout speir put johnson in touch with ernie oertle who as a salesman for the arc group of labels introduced johnson to don law to record his first sessions in san antonio texas the recording session was held on november   in room  of the gunter hotel in san antonio which brunswick records had set up to be a temporary recording studio in the ensuing threeday session johnson played  selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them he reportedly performed facing the wall which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer this conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the  album king of the delta blues singers the slide guitarist ry cooder speculates that johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar a technique he calls corner loading among the songs johnson recorded in san antonio were come on in my kitchen kind hearted woman blues i believe ill dust my broom and cross road blues the first to be released were terraplane blues and last fair deal gone down probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear terraplane blues became a modest regional hit selling  copies his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues was part of a cycle of spinoffs and response songs that began with leroy carrs mean mistreater mama  according to elijah wald it was the most musically complex in the cycle and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses in contrast to most delta players johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a rpm side most of johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session in  johnson traveled to dallas texas for another recording session with don law in a makeshift studio at the vitagraph warner brothers building at  park avenue where brunswick record corporation was located on the third floor eleven records from this session would be released within the following year johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived because of this there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place johnson recorded almost half of the  songs that make up his entire discography in dallas deathedit johnson died on august   at the age of  near greenwood mississippi of unknown causes several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about  miles  km from greenwood according to one theory johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted in an account by the blues musician sonny boy williamson johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband when johnson took the bottle williamson knocked it out of his hand admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened johnson replied dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand soon after he was offered another poisoned bottle and accepted it johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours over the next three days his condition steadily worsened witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain the musicologist robert mack mccormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview but he declined to reveal the mans name while strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed johnson at least one scholar has disputed the notion tom graves in his book crossroads the life and afterlife of blues legend robert johnson relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised even in strong liquor graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal and that death from the poison would occur within hours not days johnsons contemporary david honeyboy edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine since johnson would have died much more rapidly instead of suffering for three dayscitation needed the leflore county registrar cornelia jordan after conducting an investigation into johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics r n whitfield wrote on johnsons death certificate i talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and i also talked with a negro woman on the place the plantation owner said the negro man seemingly about  years old came from tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation he stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton the white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him he was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county the plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis gravesiteedit alleged gravesite with one of johnsons three tombstones the exact location of johnsons grave is officially unknown three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside greenwood research in the s and s strongly suggests johnson was buried in the graveyard of the mount zion missionary baptist church near morgan city mississippi not far from greenwood in an unmarked grave a oneton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk listing all of johnsons song titles with a central inscription by peter guralnick was placed at this location in  paid for by columbia records and numerous smaller contributions made through the mt zion memorial fund in  a small marker with the epitaph resting in the blues was placed in the cemetery of payne chapel near quito mississippi by an atlanta rock group named the tombstones after they saw a photograph in living blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of johnsons exgirlfriends to be johnsons burial site more recent research by stephen lavere including statements from rosie eskridge the wife of the supposed gravedigger indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the little zion church north of greenwood along money road through lavere sony music placed a marker at this site which bears laveres name as well as johnsons an interviewee in the documentary the search for robert johnson  suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave or potters field very near where he died devil legendedit according to legend as a young man living on a plantation in rural mississippi johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician he was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near dockery plantation at midnight there he was met by a large black man the devil who took the guitar and tuned it the devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to johnson giving him mastery of the instrument this was a deal with the devil mirroring the legend of faust in exchange for his soul johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous various accountsedit this legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by gayle dean wardlow edward komara and elijah wald who sees the legend as largely dating from johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death son house once told the story to pete welding as an explanation of johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in down beat in  other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from house and there were fully two years between houses observation of johnson as first a novice and then a master further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by greil marcus and robert palmer most significantly the detail was added that johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads there is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the robert johnson story all the published evidence including a full chapter on the subject in the biography crossroads by tom graves suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician tommy johnson this story was collected from his musical associate ishman bracey and his elder brother ledell in the s one version of ledell johnsons account was published in david evanss  biography of tommy johnson and was repeated in print in  alongside houses story in the widely read searching for robert johnson by peter guralnick in another version ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard this resembles the story told to steve lavere that ike zinnerman of hazlehurst mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young johnson the legendary crossroads at clarksdale mississippi recent research by the blues scholar bruce conforth in living blues magazine makes the story clearer johnson and ike zimmerman the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early s on his social security card and social security death notice on his funeral program and by his daughters did practice in a graveyard at night because it was quiet and no one would disturb them but it was not the hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed zimmerman was not from hazlehurst but nearby beauregard mississippi and he didnt practice in one graveyard but in several in the area johnson spent about a year living with and learning from zimmerman who ultimately accompanied johnson back to the delta to look after him while dockery hazlehurst and beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads there are also tourist attractions claiming to be the crossroads in both clarksdale and memphis residents of rosedale mississippi claim johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of highways  and  in their town while the  movie crossroads was filmed in beulah mississippi the blues historian steve cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads because robert johnson was a rambling guy interpretationsedit folklorist alan lomax who was instrumental in preserving johnsons recordings and spreading the mythology about his skill some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the christian figure of satan but also to the african trickster god legba himself associated with crossroads folklorist harry m hyatt wrote that during his research in the south from  to  when africanamericans born in the th or early th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads they had a different meaning in mind hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating african religious retentions surrounding legba and the making of a deal not selling the soul in the same sense as in the faustian tradition cited by graves with the socalled devil at the crossroads the blues and the blues singer has really special powers over women especially it is said that the blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted and so when robert johnson came back having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics people said he must have sold his soul to the devil and that fits in with this old african association with the crossroads where you find wisdom you go down to the crossroads to learn and in his case to learn in a faustian pact with the devil you sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history this view that the devil in johnsons songs is derived from an african deity was disputed by the blues scholar david evans in an essay published in  demythologizing the blues there are  several serious problems with this crossroads myth the devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore and nowhere do blues singers ever mention legba or any other african deity in their songs or other lore the actual african music connected with cults of legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral callandresponse singing the musicologist alan lomax dismissed the myth stating in fact every blues fiddler banjo picker harp blower piano strummer and guitar framer was in the opinion of both himself and his peers a child of the devil a consequence of the black view of the european dance embrace as sinful in the extreme musical styleedit johnson is considered a master of the blues particularly of the delta blues style keith richards of the rolling stones said in  you want to know how good the blues can get well this is it but according to elijah wald in his book escaping the delta johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues in contrast to the prevailing delta style of the time more resembled the style of chicago or st louis with a fullfledged abundantly varied musical arrangement unusual for a delta player of the time a recording exhibits what johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style theyre red hot from his first recording session shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the harlem hamfats but as wald remarked no record company was heading to mississippi in search of a downhome ink spots  he could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them the journalist marc myers wrote to the uninitiated johnsons recordings may sound like just another dusty delta blues musician wailing away but a careful listen reveals that johnson was a revisionist in his time johnsons tortured soul vocals and anxietyridden guitar playing arent found in the cottonfield blues of his contemporaries voiceedit an important aspect of johnsons singing was his use of microtonality these subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion eric clapton described johnsons music as the most powerful cry that i think you can find in the human voice in two takes of me and the devil blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse the range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing the songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked generations of blues writers in search of wild delta primitivism wrote wald have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show johnson as a polished professional performer johnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song a technique later perfected by b b king and his personified guitar named lucille in africa and in afroamerican tradition there is the tradition of the talking instrument beginning with the drums  the onestrand and then the sixstrings with bottleneckstyle performance it becomes a competing voice or a complementary voice  in the performance bob dylan wrote that when johnson started singing he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of zeus in full armor i immediately differentiated between him and anyone else i had ever heard the songs werent customary blues songs they were so utterly fluid at first they went by quick too quick to even get they jumped all over the place in range and subject matter short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic storyfires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic instrumentedit johnson mastered the guitar being considered today one of the alltime greats on the instrument his approach was complex and musically advanced when keith richards was first introduced to johnsons music by his bandmate brian jones he asked who is the other guy playing with him not realizing it was johnson playing one guitar i was hearing two guitars and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself said richards who later stated that robert johnson was like an orchestra all by himself as for his guitar technique its politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from henpicking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chuckachucka rhythm figures lyricsedit in the story with dick gordon bill ferris of american public media said robert johnson i think of in the same way i think of the british romantic poets keats and shelley who burned out early who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry  the blues if anything are deeply sexual you know my car doesnt run im gonna check my oil  if you dont like my apples dont shake my tree every verse has sexuality associated with it influencesedit johnson fused approaches specific to delta blues to those from the broader music world the slide guitar work on rambling on my mind is pure delta and johnsons vocal there has a touch of  son house rawness but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of delta blues—it is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville johnson did record versions of preaching the blues and walking blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style houses chronology has been questioned by guralnick as with the first take of come on in my kitchen the influence of skip james is evident in jamess devil got my woman but the lyrics rise to the level of firstrate poetry and johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output the sad romantic love in vain successfully blends several of johnsons disparate influences the form including the wordless last verse follows leroy carrs last hit when the sun goes down the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song blind lemon jefferson recorded in  johnsons last recording milkcows calf blues is his most direct tribute to kokomo arnold who wrote milkcow blues and influenced johnsons vocal style from four until late shows johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the delta he croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of lonnie johnson and his guitar style is more that of a ragtimeinfluenced player like blind blake lonnie johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual delta style malted milk and drunken hearted man both copy the arrangement of lonnie johnsons life saver blues the two takes of me and the devil blues show the influence of peetie wheatstraw calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heartcry of a demondriven folk artist legacyedit johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous his influence on contemporaries was much smaller in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners in juke joints and at saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music he also died young after recording only a handful of songs johnson though welltraveled and admired in his performances was little noted in his lifetime and his records were even less appreciated terraplane blues sometimes described as johnsons only hit record outsold his others but was still only a minor success if one had asked black blues fans about johnson in the first twenty years after his death writes elijah wald the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled robert who this lack of recognition extended to black musicians as far as the evolution of black music goes robert johnson was an extremely minor figure and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note columbia records released the album king of the delta blues singers a compilation of johnsons recordings in  which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death rock and rolledit johnsons greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death rock and roll and rock the rock and roll hall of fame included four of his songs in a set of  they deemed to have shaped the genre “sweet home chicago”  “cross road blues”  “hellhound on my trail”  “love in vain”  johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the advent of rock and roll dying a year or two later the rock and roll hall of fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony in  almost a half century after his death marc meyers of the wall street journal wrote that his stop breakin down blues from  is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in  rock music and related genresedit many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by johnson the most injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections are prominent rock musicians from the united kingdom his impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define rock and roll and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in  by columbia records king of the delta blues singers brian jones of the rolling stones introduced his bandmate keith richards to this album by johnson the blues masters recordings would have as much impact on him as on mick jagger the group performed his walkin blues at the rock and roll circus in  they arranged their own version of love in vain for their album let it bleed and recorded stop breakin down blues for exile on main street jagger in the role of turner in the  film performance performed excerpts from come on in my kitchen and me and the devil blues alexis korner who has been called the founding father of british blues cowrote and recorded a song entitled robert johnson for the party album released in  other examples of the influence he had on english blues and bluesrock musicians and musical groups include the following eric clapton considers johnson the most important blues musician who ever lived he recorded enough of his songs to make me and mr johnson a bluesrock album released in  as a tribute to the legendary bluesman it was also used in the film sessions for robert j he earlier recorded crossroads an arrangement of cross road blues with cream in  leading some to consider him the man largely responsible for making robert johnson a household name robert plant of led zeppelin referred to johnson on the npr radio program fresh air recorded in  as “robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way” his group recorded traveling riverside blues a song that drew from johnsons original and quoted a number of his songs the accompanying music video showed images from the delta which johnson often wrote about fleetwood mac was strongly influenced by johnson in the groups early years as a british blues band guitarist jeremy spencer contributed two covers of johnsonderived songs to the groups early albums and lead guitarist peter green later recorded johnsons entire catalogue in two albums the robert johnson songbook and hot foot powder sam dunns documentary metal evolution cites johnson as the great grandfather to all things heavy metal with members of the bands rush and slipknot agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music bob dylan wrote of johnson in his  autobiography chronicles volume one if i hadnt heard the robert johnson record when i did there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that i wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write guitar techniqueedit l gibson guitar subsequently reissued by gibson as a tribute to johnson johnsons revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary experts assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time in  spin magazine rated him first in its list of  guitar gods—on the nd anniversary of his death in  rolling stone magazine ranked him fifth on their list of  greatest guitarists of all time— years after he died in  guitarcom ranked him ninth in its list of top  guitarists of all time— years after he died musicians who proclaim johnsons profound impact on them—including keith richards jimi hendrix and eric clapton—all rated in the top ten with him on each of these lists the boogie bass line he fashioned for i believe ill dust my broom has now passed into the standard guitar repertoire at the time it was completely new a guitarists version of something people would otherwise have heard only from a piano lifetime achievementedit the complete recordings a doubledisc boxed set released by sonycolumbia legacy on august   containing almost everything johnson ever recorded with all  recordings and  alternate takes won a grammy award for “best historical album” that year in  johnson was awarded a grammy lifetime achievement award accepted by his son claud use in advertisementsedit johnsons recordings such as sweet home chicago have been used by companies and nonprofit organizations for marketing purposes sweet home chicago is played at many events in chicago problems of biographyedit the thing about robert johnson was that he only existed on his records he was pure legend –martin scorsese love in vain a vision of robert johnson very little of johnsons early life is known with certainty two marriage licenses for johnson have been located in county records offices the ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates as do the entries showing his attendance at indian creek school in tunica mississippi that he was not listed among his mothers children in the  census casts further doubt on these dates carrie thompson claimed that her mother who was also roberts mother remembered his birth date as may   the  census gives his age as  suggesting he was born in  or  five significant dates from his career are documented monday thursday and friday november   and   at a recording session in san antonio texas and saturday and sunday june  and   at a recording session in dallas his death certificate discovered in  lists the date and location of his death johnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release and efforts were made to discover his biography with virtually no success the blues researcher mack mccormick began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings mccormicks research eventually became as much a legend as johnson himself in  mccormick permitted peter guralnick to publish a summary in living blues  later reprinted in book form as searching for robert johnson later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details a revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by stephen lavere for the booklet accompanying the compilation album robert johnson the complete recordings  and is maintained with updates at the delta haze website the documentary film the search for robert johnson contains accounts by mccormick and wardlow of what informants have told them long interviews of david honeyboy edwards and johnny shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family these published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts a relatively full account of johnsons brief musical career emerged in the s largely from accounts by son house johnny shines david honeyboy edwards and robert lockwood in  the sleeve notes to the album king of the delta blues singers included reminiscences of don law who had recorded johnson in  law added to the mystique surrounding johnson representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy photographsedit the two confirmed images of johnson were located in  in the possession of his halfsister carrie thompson but were not widely published until the late s a third photo purporting to show johnson posing with the blues musician johnny shines was published in the november  issue of vanity fair magazine it was declared authentic by the forensic artist lois gibson and by johnsons estate in  the authenticity of the third photo has been disputed by some music historians including elijah wald bruce conforth and gayle dean wardlow who considered that the clothing suggests a date after johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched in december  a fourth photograph was published purportedly showing johnson his wife calletta craft estella coleman and robert lockwood jr this photograph was also declared authentic by lois gibson but her identification of johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians in his book searching for robert johnson peter guralnick stated that the blues archivist mack mccormick showed him a photograph of johnson with his nephew louis probably taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph showing louis dressed in his united states navy uniform this photograph has never been made public playback speed hypothesisedit in the guardians music blog from may  jon wilde speculated that johnsons recordings may have been accidentally speeded up when first committed to  rpm records or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting he did not give a source for this statement biographer elijah wald and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds including that johnsons extant recordings were made on five different days spread across two years at two different studios making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable in addition fellow musicians contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than  years preceding wildes hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered descendantsedit johnson left no will in  the mississippi supreme court ruled that claud johnson a retired truck driver living in crystal springs mississippi was the son of robert johnson and his sole heir the court heard that he had been born to virgie jane smith later virgie jane cain who had a relationship with robert johnson in  the relationship was attested to by a friend eula mae williams but other relatives descended from robert johnsons halfsister carrie harris thompson contested claud

johnson born december  julia was married to charles dodds born february  a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker with whom she had ten children charles dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners julia left hazlehurst with baby robert but after two years sent the boy to memphis to live with her husband who had changed his name to charles spencer about  robert rejoined his mother in the mississippi delta area around tunica and robinsonville mississippi julias new husband known as dusty willis was  years her junior robert was remembered by some residents as little robert dusty but he was registered at tunicas indian creek school as robert spencer in the  census he is listed as robert spencer living in lucas arkansas with will and julia willis robert was at school in  and  the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background a school friend willie coffee who was interviewed and filmed in later life recalled that as a youth robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp coffee recalled that robert was absent for long periods which suggests that he may have been living and studying in memphis after school robert adopted the surname of his natural father signing himself as robert johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteenyearold virginia travis in february  she died in childbirth shortly after surviving relatives of virginia told the blues researcher robert mack mccormick that this was a divine punishment for roberts decision to sing secular songs known as selling your soul to the devil mccormick believed that johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a fulltime blues musician around this time the blues musician son house moved to robinsonville where his musical partner willie brown lived late in life house remembered johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist soon after johnson left robinsonville for the area around martinsville close to his birthplace possibly searching for his natural father here he perfected the guitar style of house and learned other styles from isaiah ike zinnerman zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight when johnson next appeared in robinsonville he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique house was interviewed at a time when the legend of johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers he was asked whether he attributed johnsons technique to this pact and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation while living in martinsville johnson fathered a child with vergie mae smith he married caletta craft in may  in  the couple moved to clarksdale mississippi in the delta here caletta died in childbirth and johnson left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician itinerant musicianedit from  until his death in  johnson moved frequently between cities like memphis tennessee and helena arkansas and the smaller towns of the mississippi delta and neighboring regions of mississippi and arkansas on occasion he traveled much farther the blues musician johnny shines accompanied him to chicago texas new york canada kentucky and indiana henry townsend shared a musical engagement with him in st louis in many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends he did not marry again but formed some longterm relationships with women to whom he would return periodically one was estella coleman the mother of the blues musician robert lockwood jr in other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance in each location johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere he used different names in different places employing at least eight distinct surnames biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew johnson in different contexts shines who traveled extensively with him lockwood who knew him as his mothers partner david honeyboy edwards whose cousin willie mae powell had a relationship with johnson from a mass of partial conflicting and inconsistent eyewitness accounts biographers have attempted to summarize johnsons character he was well mannered he was soft spoken he was indecipherable as for his character everyone seems to agree that while he was pleasant and outgoing in public in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way musicians who knew johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except of course for his musical talent his weakness for whiskey and women and his commitment to the road when johnson arrived in a new town he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant musical associates have said that in live performances johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions but instead pleased audiences by performing more wellknown pop standards of the day – and not necessarily blues with an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music he also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience in every town in which he stopped he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later shines was  when he met johnson in  he estimated johnson was maybe a year older than himself shines is quoted describing johnson in samuel charterss robert johnson robert was a very friendly person even though he was sulky at times you know and i hung around robert for quite a while one evening he disappeared he was kind of a peculiar fellow robertd be standing up playing some place playing like nobodys business at about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure and moneyd be coming from all directions but robertd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing and you wouldnt see robert no more maybe in two or three weeks  so robert and i we began journeying off i was just matter of fact tagging along during this time johnson established what would be a relatively longterm relationship with estella coleman a woman about  years his senior and the mother of the musician robert lockwood jr johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in he reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them and in most cases he was accepted until a boyfriend arrived or johnson was ready to move on in  alan lomax learned from muddy waters that johnson had performed in the area around clarksdale mississippi by  the historian samuel charters could add only that will shade of the memphis jug band remembered johnson had once briefly played with him in west memphis arkansas in the last year of his life johnson is believed to have traveled to st louis and possibly illinois and then to some states in the east in  columbia records producer john h hammond who owned some of johnsons records directed the record producer don law seek out johnson to book him for the first from spirituals to swing concert at carnegie hall in new york on learning of johnsons death hammond replaced him with big bill broonzy but he played two of johnsons records from the stage recording sessionsedit johnsons recordings were released by several record companies milkcows calf blues by perfect love in vain blues by vocalion and i believe ill dust my broom by conqueror in jackson mississippi around  johnson sought out h c speir who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout speir put johnson in touch with ernie oertle who as a salesman for the arc group of labels introduced johnson to don law to record his first sessions in san antonio texas the recording session was held on november   in room  of the gunter hotel in san antonio which brunswick records had set up to be a temporary recording studio in the ensuing threeday session johnson played  selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them he reportedly performed facing the wall which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer this conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the  album king of the delta blues singers the slide guitarist ry cooder speculates that johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar a technique he calls corner loading among the songs johnson recorded in san antonio were come on in my kitchen kind hearted woman blues i believe ill dust my broom and cross road blues the first to be released were terraplane blues and last fair deal gone down probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear terraplane blues became a modest regional hit selling  copies his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues was part of a cycle of spinoffs and response songs that began with leroy carrs mean mistreater mama  according to elijah wald it was the most musically complex in the cycle and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses in contrast to most delta players johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a rpm side most of johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session in  johnson traveled to dallas texas for another recording session with don law in a makeshift studio at the vitagraph warner brothers building at  park avenue where brunswick record corporation was located on the third floor eleven records from this session would be released within the following year johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived because of this there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place johnson recorded almost half of the  songs that make up his entire discography in dallas deathedit johnson died on august   at the age of  near greenwood mississippi of unknown causes several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about  miles  km from greenwood according to one theory johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted in an account by the blues musician sonny boy williamson johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband when johnson took the bottle williamson knocked it out of his hand admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened johnson replied dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand soon after he was offered another poisoned bottle and accepted it johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours over the next three days his condition steadily worsened witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain the musicologist robert mack mccormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview but he declined to reveal the mans name while strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed johnson at least one scholar has disputed the notion tom graves in his book crossroads the life and afterlife of blues legend robert johnson relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised even in strong liquor graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal and that death from the poison would occur within hours not days johnsons contemporary david honeyboy edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine since johnson would have died much more rapidly instead of suffering for three dayscitation needed the leflore county registrar cornelia jordan after conducting an investigation into johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics r n whitfield wrote on johnsons death certificate i talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and i also talked with a negro woman on the place the plantation owner said the negro man seemingly about  years old came from tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation he stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton the white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him he was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county the plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis gravesiteedit alleged gravesite with one of johnsons three tombstones the exact location of johnsons grave is officially unknown three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside greenwood research in the s and s strongly suggests johnson was buried in the graveyard of the mount zion missionary baptist church near morgan city mississippi not far from greenwood in an unmarked grave a oneton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk listing all of johnsons song titles with a central inscription by peter guralnick was placed at this location in  paid for by columbia records and numerous smaller contributions made through the mt zion memorial fund in  a small marker with the epitaph resting in the blues was placed in the cemetery of payne chapel near quito mississippi by an atlanta rock group named the tombstones after they saw a photograph in living blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of johnsons exgirlfriends to be johnsons burial site more recent research by stephen lavere including statements from rosie eskridge the wife of the supposed gravedigger indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the little zion church north of greenwood along money road through lavere sony music placed a marker at this site which bears laveres name as well as johnsons an interviewee in the documentary the search for robert johnson  suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave or potters field very near where he died devil legendedit according to legend as a young man living on a plantation in rural mississippi johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician he was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near dockery plantation at midnight there he was met by a large black man the devil who took the guitar and tuned it the devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to johnson giving him mastery of the instrument this was a deal with the devil mirroring the legend of faust in exchange for his soul johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous various accountsedit this legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by gayle dean wardlow edward komara and elijah wald who sees the legend as largely dating from johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death son house once told the story to pete welding as an explanation of johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in down beat in  other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from house and there were fully two years between houses observation of johnson as first a novice and then a master further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by greil marcus and robert palmer most significantly the detail was added that johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads there is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the robert johnson story all the published evidence including a full chapter on the subject in the biography crossroads by tom graves suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician tommy johnson this story was collected from his musical associate ishman bracey and his elder brother ledell in the s one version of ledell johnsons account was published in david evanss  biography of tommy johnson and was repeated in print in  alongside houses story in the widely read searching for robert johnson by peter guralnick in another version ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard this resembles the story told to steve lavere that ike zinnerman of hazlehurst mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young johnson the legendary crossroads at clarksdale mississippi recent research by the blues scholar bruce conforth in living blues magazine makes the story clearer johnson and ike zimmerman the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early s on his social security card and social security death notice on his funeral program and by his daughters did practice in a graveyard at night because it was quiet and no one would disturb them but it was not the hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed zimmerman was not from hazlehurst but nearby beauregard mississippi and he didnt practice in one graveyard but in several in the area johnson spent about a year living with and learning from zimmerman who ultimately accompanied johnson back to the delta to look after him while dockery hazlehurst and beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads there are also tourist attractions claiming to be the crossroads in both clarksdale and memphis residents of rosedale mississippi claim johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of highways  and  in their town while the  movie crossroads was filmed in beulah mississippi the blues historian steve cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads because robert johnson was a rambling guy interpretationsedit folklorist alan lomax who was instrumental in preserving johnsons recordings and spreading the mythology about his skill some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the christian figure of satan but also to the african trickster god legba himself associated with crossroads folklorist harry m hyatt wrote that during his research in the south from  to  when africanamericans born in the th or early th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads they had a different meaning in mind hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating african religious retentions surrounding legba and the making of a deal not selling the soul in the same sense as in the faustian tradition cited by graves with the socalled devil at the crossroads the blues and the blues singer has really special powers over women especially it is said that the blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted and so when robert johnson came back having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics people said he must have sold his soul to the devil and that fits in with this old african association with the crossroads where you find wisdom you go down to the crossroads to learn and in his case to learn in a faustian pact with the devil you sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history this view that the devil in johnsons songs is derived from an african deity was disputed by the blues scholar david evans in an essay published in  demythologizing the blues there are  several serious problems with this crossroads myth the devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore and nowhere do blues singers ever mention legba or any other african deity in their songs or other lore the actual african music connected with cults of legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral callandresponse singing the musicologist alan lomax dismissed the myth stating in fact every blues fiddler banjo picker harp blower piano strummer and guitar framer was in the opinion of both himself and his peers a child of the devil a consequence of the black view of the european dance embrace as sinful in the extreme musical styleedit johnson is considered a master of the blues particularly of the delta blues style keith richards of the rolling stones said in  you want to know how good the blues can get well this is it but according to elijah wald in his book escaping the delta johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues in contrast to the prevailing delta style of the time more resembled the style of chicago or st louis with a fullfledged abundantly varied musical arrangement unusual for a delta player of the time a recording exhibits what johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style theyre red hot from his first recording session shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the harlem hamfats but as wald remarked no record company was heading to mississippi in search of a downhome ink spots  he could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them the journalist marc myers wrote to the uninitiated johnsons recordings may sound like just another dusty delta blues musician wailing away but a careful listen reveals that johnson was a revisionist in his time johnsons tortured soul vocals and anxietyridden guitar playing arent found in the cottonfield blues of his contemporaries voiceedit an important aspect of johnsons singing was his use of microtonality these subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion eric clapton described johnsons music as the most powerful cry that i think you can find in the human voice in two takes of me and the devil blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse the range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing the songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked generations of blues writers in search of wild delta primitivism wrote wald have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show johnson as a polished professional performer johnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song a technique later perfected by b b king and his personified guitar named lucille in africa and in afroamerican tradition there is the tradition of the talking instrument beginning with the drums  the onestrand and then the sixstrings with bottleneckstyle performance it becomes a competing voice or a complementary voice  in the performance bob dylan wrote that when johnson started singing he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of zeus in full armor i immediately differentiated between him and anyone else i had ever heard the songs werent customary blues songs they were so utterly fluid at first they went by quick too quick to even get they jumped all over the place in range and subject matter short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic storyfires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic instrumentedit johnson mastered the guitar being considered today one of the alltime greats on the instrument his approach was complex and musically advanced when keith richards was first introduced to johnsons music by his bandmate brian jones he asked who is the other guy playing with him not realizing it was johnson playing one guitar i was hearing two guitars and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself said richards who later stated that robert johnson was like an orchestra all by himself as for his guitar technique its politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from henpicking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chuckachucka rhythm figures lyricsedit in the story with dick gordon bill ferris of american public media said robert johnson i think of in the same way i think of the british romantic poets keats and shelley who burned out early who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry  the blues if anything are deeply sexual you know my car doesnt run im gonna check my oil  if you dont like my apples dont shake my tree every verse has sexuality associated with it influencesedit johnson fused approaches specific to delta blues to those from the broader music world the slide guitar work on rambling on my mind is pure delta and johnsons vocal there has a touch of  son house rawness but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of delta blues—it is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville johnson did record versions of preaching the blues and walking blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style houses chronology has been questioned by guralnick as with the first take of come on in my kitchen the influence of skip james is evident in jamess devil got my woman but the lyrics rise to the level of firstrate poetry and johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output the sad romantic love in vain successfully blends several of johnsons disparate influences the form including the wordless last verse follows leroy carrs last hit when the sun goes down the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song blind lemon jefferson recorded in  johnsons last recording milkcows calf blues is his most direct tribute to kokomo arnold who wrote milkcow blues and influenced johnsons vocal style from four until late shows johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the delta he croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of lonnie johnson and his guitar style is more that of a ragtimeinfluenced player like blind blake lonnie johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual delta style malted milk and drunken hearted man both copy the arrangement of lonnie johnsons life saver blues the two takes of me and the devil blues show the influence of peetie wheatstraw calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heartcry of a demondriven folk artist legacyedit johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous his influence on contemporaries was much smaller in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners in juke joints and at saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music he also died young after recording only a handful of songs johnson though welltraveled and admired in his performances was little noted in his lifetime and his records were even less appreciated terraplane blues sometimes described as johnsons only hit record outsold his others but was still only a minor success if one had asked black blues fans about johnson in the first twenty years after his death writes elijah wald the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled robert who this lack of recognition extended to black musicians as far as the evolution of black music goes robert johnson was an extremely minor figure and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note columbia records released the album king of the delta blues singers a compilation of johnsons recordings in  which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death rock and rolledit johnsons greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death rock and roll and rock the rock and roll hall of fame included four of his songs in a set of  they deemed to have shaped the genre “sweet home chicago”  “cross road blues”  “hellhound on my trail”  “love in vain”  johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the advent of rock and roll dying a year or two later the rock and roll hall of fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony in  almost a half century after his death marc meyers of the wall street journal wrote that his stop breakin down blues from  is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in  rock music and related genresedit many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by johnson the most injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections are prominent rock musicians from the united kingdom his impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define rock and roll and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in  by columbia records king of the delta blues singers brian jones of the rolling stones introduced his bandmate keith richards to this album by johnson the blues masters recordings would have as much impact on him as on mick jagger the group performed his walkin blues at the rock and roll circus in  they arranged their own version of love in vain for their album let it bleed and recorded stop breakin down blues for exile on main street jagger in the role of turner in the  film performance performed excerpts from come on in my kitchen and me and the devil blues alexis korner who has been called the founding father of british blues cowrote and recorded a song entitled robert johnson for the party album released in  other examples of the influence he had on english blues and bluesrock musicians and musical groups include the following eric clapton considers johnson the most important blues musician who ever lived he recorded enough of his songs to make me and mr johnson a bluesrock album released in  as a tribute to the legendary bluesman it was also used in the film sessions for robert j he earlier recorded crossroads an arrangement of cross road blues with cream in  leading some to consider him the man largely responsible for making robert johnson a household name robert plant of led zeppelin referred to johnson on the npr radio program fresh air recorded in  as “robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way” his group recorded traveling riverside blues a song that drew from johnsons original and quoted a number of his songs the accompanying music video showed images from the delta which johnson often wrote about fleetwood mac was strongly influenced by johnson in the groups early years as a british blues band guitarist jeremy spencer contributed two covers of johnsonderived songs to the groups early albums and lead guitarist peter green later recorded johnsons entire catalogue in two albums the robert johnson songbook and hot foot powder sam dunns documentary metal evolution cites johnson as the great grandfather to all things heavy metal with members of the bands rush and slipknot agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music bob dylan wrote of johnson in his  autobiography chronicles volume one if i hadnt heard the robert johnson record when i did there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that i wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write guitar techniqueedit l gibson guitar subsequently reissued by gibson as a tribute to johnson johnsons revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary experts assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time in  spin magazine rated him first in its list of  guitar gods—on the nd anniversary of his death in  rolling stone magazine ranked him fifth on their list of  greatest guitarists of all time— years after he died in  guitarcom ranked him ninth in its list of top  guitarists of all time— years after he died musicians who proclaim johnsons profound impact on them—including keith richards jimi hendrix and eric clapton—all rated in the top ten with him on each of these lists the boogie bass line he fashioned for i believe ill dust my broom has now passed into the standard guitar repertoire at the time it was completely new a guitarists version of something people would otherwise have heard only from a piano lifetime achievementedit the complete recordings a doubledisc boxed set released by sonycolumbia legacy on august   containing almost everything johnson ever recorded with all  recordings and  alternate takes won a grammy award for “best historical album” that year in  johnson was awarded a grammy lifetime achievement award accepted by his son claud use in advertisementsedit johnsons recordings such as sweet home chicago have been used by companies and nonprofit organizations for marketing purposes sweet home chicago is played at many events in chicago problems of biographyedit the thing about robert johnson was that he only existed on his records he was pure legend –martin scorsese love in vain a vision of robert johnson very little of johnsons early life is known with certainty two marriage licenses for johnson have been located in county records offices the ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates as do the entries showing his attendance at indian creek school in tunica mississippi that he was not listed among his mothers children in the  census casts further doubt on these dates carrie thompson claimed that her mother who was also roberts mother remembered his birth date as may   the  census gives his age as  suggesting he was born in  or  five significant dates from his career are documented monday thursday and friday november   and   at a recording session in san antonio texas and saturday and sunday june  and   at a recording session in dallas his death certificate discovered in  lists the date and location of his death johnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release and efforts were made to discover his biography with virtually no success the blues researcher mack mccormick began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings mccormicks research eventually became as much a legend as johnson himself in  mccormick permitted peter guralnick to publish a summary in living blues  later reprinted in book form as searching for robert johnson later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details a revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by stephen lavere for the booklet accompanying the compilation album robert johnson the complete recordings  and is maintained with updates at the delta haze website the documentary film the search for robert johnson contains accounts by mccormick and wardlow of what informants have told them long interviews of david honeyboy edwards and johnny shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family these published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts a relatively full account of johnsons brief musical career emerged in the s largely from accounts by son house johnny shines david honeyboy edwards and robert lockwood in  the sleeve notes to the album king of the delta blues singers included reminiscences of don law who had recorded johnson in  law added to the mystique surrounding johnson representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy photographsedit the two confirmed images of johnson were located in  in the possession of his halfsister carrie thompson but were not widely published until the late s a third photo purporting to show johnson posing with the blues musician johnny shines was published in the november  issue of vanity fair magazine it was declared authentic by the forensic artist lois gibson and by johnsons estate in  the authenticity of the third photo has been disputed by some music historians including elijah wald bruce conforth and gayle dean wardlow who considered that the clothing suggests a date after johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched in december  a fourth photograph was published purportedly showing johnson his wife calletta craft estella coleman and robert lockwood jr this photograph was also declared authentic by lois gibson but her identification of johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians in his book searching for robert johnson peter guralnick stated that the blues archivist mack mccormick showed him a photograph of johnson with his nephew louis probably taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph showing louis dressed in his united states navy uniform this photograph has never been made public playback speed hypothesisedit in the guardians music blog from may  jon wilde speculated that johnsons recordings may have been accidentally speeded up when first committed to  rpm records or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting he did not give a source for this statement biographer elijah wald and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds

of his recordings in  on the lp king of the delta blues singers his work reached a wider audience johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues particularly of the mississippi delta blues style

johnson born december  julia was married to charles dodds born february  a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker with whom she had ten children charles dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners julia left hazlehurst with baby robert but after two years sent the boy to memphis to live with her husband who had changed his name to charles spencer about  robert rejoined his mother in the mississippi delta area around tunica and robinsonville mississippi julias new husband known as dusty willis was  years her junior robert was remembered by some residents as little robert dusty but he was registered at tunicas indian creek school as robert spencer in the  census he is listed as robert spencer living in lucas arkansas with will and julia willis robert was at school in  and  the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background a school friend willie coffee who was interviewed and filmed in later life recalled that as a youth robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp coffee recalled that robert was absent for long periods which suggests that he may have been living and studying in memphis after school robert adopted the surname of his natural father signing himself as robert johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteenyearold virginia travis in february  she died in childbirth shortly after surviving relatives of virginia told the blues researcher robert mack mccormick that this was a divine punishment for roberts decision to sing secular songs known as selling your soul to the devil mccormick believed that johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a fulltime blues musician around this time the blues musician son house moved to robinsonville where his musical partner willie brown lived late in life house remembered johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist soon after johnson left robinsonville for the area around martinsville close to his birthplace possibly searching for his natural father here he perfected the guitar style of house and learned other styles from isaiah ike zinnerman zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight when johnson next appeared in robinsonville he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique house was interviewed at a time when the legend of johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers he was asked whether he attributed johnsons technique to this pact and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation while living in martinsville johnson fathered a child with vergie mae smith he married caletta craft in may  in  the couple moved to clarksdale mississippi in the delta here caletta died in childbirth and johnson left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician itinerant musicianedit from  until his death in  johnson moved frequently between cities like memphis tennessee and helena arkansas and the smaller towns of the mississippi delta and neighboring regions of mississippi and arkansas on occasion he traveled much farther the blues musician johnny shines accompanied him to chicago texas new york canada kentucky and indiana henry townsend shared a musical engagement with him in st louis in many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends he did not marry again but formed some longterm relationships with women to whom he would return periodically one was estella coleman the mother of the blues musician robert lockwood jr in other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance in each location johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere he used different names in different places employing at least eight distinct surnames biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew johnson in different contexts shines who traveled extensively with him lockwood who knew him as his mothers partner david honeyboy edwards whose cousin willie mae powell had a relationship with johnson from a mass of partial conflicting and inconsistent eyewitness accounts biographers have attempted to summarize johnsons character he was well mannered he was soft spoken he was indecipherable as for his character everyone seems to agree that while he was pleasant and outgoing in public in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way musicians who knew johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except of course for his musical talent his weakness for whiskey and women and his commitment to the road when johnson arrived in a new town he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant musical associates have said that in live performances johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions but instead pleased audiences by performing more wellknown pop standards of the day – and not necessarily blues with an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music he also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience in every town in which he stopped he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later shines was  when he met johnson in  he estimated johnson was maybe a year older than himself shines is quoted describing johnson in samuel charterss robert johnson robert was a very friendly person even though he was sulky at times you know and i hung around robert for quite a while one evening he disappeared he was kind of a peculiar fellow robertd be standing up playing some place playing like nobodys business at about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure and moneyd be coming from all directions but robertd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing and you wouldnt see robert no more maybe in two or three weeks  so robert and i we began journeying off i was just matter of fact tagging along during this time johnson established what would be a relatively longterm relationship with estella coleman a woman about  years his senior and the mother of the musician robert lockwood jr johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in he reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them and in most cases he was accepted until a boyfriend arrived or johnson was ready to move on in  alan lomax learned from muddy waters that johnson had performed in the area around clarksdale mississippi by  the historian samuel charters could add only that will shade of the memphis jug band remembered johnson had once briefly played with him in west memphis arkansas in the last year of his life johnson is believed to have traveled to st louis and possibly illinois and then to some states in the east in  columbia records producer john h hammond who owned some of johnsons records directed the record producer don law seek out johnson to book him for the first from spirituals to swing concert at carnegie hall in new york on learning of johnsons death hammond replaced him with big bill broonzy but he played two of johnsons records from the stage recording sessionsedit johnsons recordings were released by several record companies milkcows calf blues by perfect love in vain blues by vocalion and i believe ill dust my broom by conqueror in jackson mississippi around  johnson sought out h c speir who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout speir put johnson in touch with ernie oertle who as a salesman for the arc group of labels introduced johnson to don law to record his first sessions in san antonio texas the recording session was held on november   in room  of the gunter hotel in san antonio which brunswick records had set up to be a temporary recording studio in the ensuing threeday session johnson played  selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them he reportedly performed facing the wall which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer this conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the  album king of the delta blues singers the slide guitarist ry cooder speculates that johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar a technique he calls corner loading among the songs johnson recorded in san antonio were come on in my kitchen kind hearted woman blues i believe ill dust my broom and cross road blues the first to be released were terraplane blues and last fair deal gone down probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear terraplane blues became a modest regional hit selling  copies his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues was part of a cycle of spinoffs and response songs that began with leroy carrs mean mistreater mama  according to elijah wald it was the most musically complex in the cycle and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses in contrast to most delta players johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a rpm side most of johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session in  johnson traveled to dallas texas for another recording session with don law in a makeshift studio at the vitagraph warner brothers building at  park avenue where brunswick record corporation was located on the third floor eleven records from this session would be released within the following year johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived because of this there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place johnson recorded almost half of the  songs that make up his entire discography in dallas deathedit johnson died on august   at the age of  near greenwood mississippi of unknown causes several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about  miles  km from greenwood according to one theory johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted in an account by the blues musician sonny boy williamson johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband when johnson took the bottle williamson knocked it out of his hand admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened johnson replied dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand soon after he was offered another poisoned bottle and accepted it johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours over the next three days his condition steadily worsened witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain the musicologist robert mack mccormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview but he declined to reveal the mans name while strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed johnson at least one scholar has disputed the notion tom graves in his book crossroads the life and afterlife of blues legend robert johnson relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised even in strong liquor graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal and that death from the poison would occur within hours not days johnsons contemporary david honeyboy edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine since johnson would have died much more rapidly instead of suffering for three dayscitation needed the leflore county registrar cornelia jordan after conducting an investigation into johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics r n whitfield wrote on johnsons death certificate i talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and i also talked with a negro woman on the place the plantation owner said the negro man seemingly about  years old came from tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation he stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton the white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him he was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county the plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis gravesiteedit alleged gravesite with one of johnsons three tombstones the exact location of johnsons grave is officially unknown three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside greenwood research in the s and s strongly suggests johnson was buried in the graveyard of the mount zion missionary baptist church near morgan city mississippi not far from greenwood in an unmarked grave a oneton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk listing all of johnsons song titles with a central inscription by peter guralnick was placed at this location in  paid for by columbia records and numerous smaller contributions made through the mt zion memorial fund in  a small marker with the epitaph resting in the blues was placed in the cemetery of payne chapel near quito mississippi by an atlanta rock group named the tombstones after they saw a photograph in living blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of johnsons exgirlfriends to be johnsons burial site more recent research by stephen lavere including statements from rosie eskridge the wife of the supposed gravedigger indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the little zion church north of greenwood along money road through lavere sony music placed a marker at this site which bears laveres name as well as johnsons an interviewee in the documentary the search for robert johnson  suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave or potters field very near where he died devil legendedit according to legend as a young man living on a plantation in rural mississippi johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician he was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near dockery plantation at midnight there he was met by a large black man the devil who took the guitar and tuned it the devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to johnson giving him mastery of the instrument this was a deal with the devil mirroring the legend of faust in exchange for his soul johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous various accountsedit this legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by gayle dean wardlow edward komara and elijah wald who sees the legend as largely dating from johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death son house once told the story to pete welding as an explanation of johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in down beat in  other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from house and there were fully two years between houses observation of johnson as first a novice and then a master further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by greil marcus and robert palmer most significantly the detail was added that johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads there is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the robert johnson story all the published evidence including a full chapter on the subject in the biography crossroads by tom graves suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician tommy johnson this story was collected from his musical associate ishman bracey and his elder brother ledell in the s one version of ledell johnsons account was published in david evanss  biography of tommy johnson and was repeated in print in  alongside houses story in the widely read searching for robert johnson by peter guralnick in another version ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard this resembles the story told to steve lavere that ike zinnerman of hazlehurst mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young johnson the legendary crossroads at clarksdale mississippi recent research by the blues scholar bruce conforth in living blues magazine makes the story clearer johnson and ike zimmerman the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early s on his social security card and social security death notice on his funeral program and by his daughters did practice in a graveyard at night because it was quiet and no one would disturb them but it was not the hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed zimmerman was not from hazlehurst but nearby beauregard mississippi and he didnt practice in one graveyard but in several in the area johnson spent about a year living with and learning from zimmerman who ultimately accompanied johnson back to the delta to look after him while dockery hazlehurst and beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads there are also tourist attractions claiming to be the crossroads in both clarksdale and memphis residents of rosedale mississippi claim johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of highways  and  in their town while the  movie crossroads was filmed in beulah mississippi the blues historian steve cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads because robert johnson was a rambling guy interpretationsedit folklorist alan lomax who was instrumental in preserving johnsons recordings and spreading the mythology about his skill some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the christian figure of satan but also to the african trickster god legba himself associated with crossroads folklorist harry m hyatt wrote that during his research in the south from  to  when africanamericans born in the th or early th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads they had a different meaning in mind hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating african religious retentions surrounding legba and the making of a deal not selling the soul in the same sense as in the faustian tradition cited by graves with the socalled devil at the crossroads the blues and the blues singer has really special powers over women especially it is said that the blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted and so when robert johnson came back having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics people said he must have sold his soul to the devil and that fits in with this old african association with the crossroads where you find wisdom you go down to the crossroads to learn and in his case to learn in a faustian pact with the devil you sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history this view that the devil in johnsons songs is derived from an african deity was disputed by the blues scholar david evans in an essay published in  demythologizing the blues there are  several serious problems with this crossroads myth the devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore and nowhere do blues singers ever mention legba or any other african deity in their songs or other lore the actual african music connected with cults of legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral callandresponse singing the musicologist alan lomax dismissed the myth stating in fact every blues fiddler banjo picker harp blower piano strummer and guitar framer was in the opinion of both himself and his peers a child of the devil a consequence of the black view of the european dance embrace as sinful in the extreme musical styleedit johnson is considered a master of the blues particularly of the delta blues style keith richards of the rolling stones said in  you want to know how good the blues can get well this is it but according to elijah wald in his book escaping the delta johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues in contrast to the prevailing delta style of the time more resembled the style of chicago or st louis with a fullfledged abundantly varied musical arrangement unusual for a delta player of the time a recording exhibits what johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style theyre red hot from his first recording session shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the harlem hamfats but as wald remarked no record company was heading to mississippi in search of a downhome ink spots  he could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them the journalist marc myers wrote to the uninitiated johnsons recordings may sound like just another dusty delta blues musician wailing away but a careful listen reveals that johnson was a revisionist in his time johnsons tortured soul vocals and anxietyridden guitar playing arent found in the cottonfield blues of his contemporaries voiceedit an important aspect of johnsons singing was his use of microtonality these subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion eric clapton described johnsons music as the most powerful cry that i think you can find in the human voice in two takes of me and the devil blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse the range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing the songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked generations of blues writers in search of wild delta primitivism wrote wald have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show johnson as a polished professional performer johnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song a technique later perfected by b b king and his personified guitar named lucille in africa and in afroamerican tradition there is the tradition of the talking instrument beginning with the drums  the onestrand and then the sixstrings with bottleneckstyle performance it becomes a competing voice or a complementary voice  in the performance bob dylan wrote that when johnson started singing he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of zeus in full armor i immediately differentiated between him and anyone else i had ever heard the songs werent customary blues songs they were so utterly fluid at first they went by quick too quick to even get they jumped all over the place in range and subject matter short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic storyfires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic instrumentedit johnson mastered the guitar being considered today one of the alltime greats on the instrument his approach was complex and musically advanced when keith richards was first introduced to johnsons music by his bandmate brian jones he asked who is the other guy playing with him not realizing it was johnson playing one guitar i was hearing two guitars and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself said richards who later stated that robert johnson was like an orchestra all by himself as for his guitar technique its politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from henpicking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chuckachucka rhythm figures lyricsedit in the story with dick gordon bill ferris of american public media said robert johnson i think of in the same way i think of the british romantic poets keats and shelley who burned out early who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry  the blues if anything are deeply sexual you know my car doesnt run im gonna check my oil  if you dont like my apples dont shake my tree every verse has sexuality associated with it influencesedit johnson fused approaches specific to delta blues to those from the broader music world the slide guitar work on rambling on my mind is pure delta and johnsons vocal there has a touch of  son house rawness but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of delta blues—it is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville johnson did record versions of preaching the blues and walking blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style houses chronology has been questioned by guralnick as with the first take of come on in my kitchen the influence of skip james is evident in jamess devil got my woman but the lyrics rise to the level of firstrate poetry and johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output the sad romantic love in vain successfully blends several of johnsons disparate influences the form including the wordless last verse follows leroy carrs last hit when the sun goes down the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song blind lemon jefferson recorded in  johnsons last recording milkcows calf blues is his most direct tribute to kokomo arnold who wrote milkcow blues and influenced johnsons vocal style from four until late shows johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the delta he croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of lonnie johnson and his guitar style is more that of a ragtimeinfluenced player like blind blake lonnie johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual delta style malted milk and drunken hearted man both copy the arrangement of lonnie johnsons life saver blues the two takes of me and the devil blues show the influence of peetie wheatstraw calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heartcry of a demondriven folk artist legacyedit johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous his influence on contemporaries was much smaller in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners in juke joints and at saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music he also died young after recording only a handful of songs johnson though welltraveled and admired in his performances was little noted in his lifetime and his records were even less appreciated terraplane blues sometimes described as johnsons only hit record outsold his others but was still only a minor success if one had asked black blues fans about johnson in the first twenty years after his death writes elijah wald the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled robert who this lack of recognition extended to black musicians as far as the evolution of black music goes robert johnson was an extremely minor figure and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note columbia records released the album king of the delta blues singers a compilation of johnsons recordings in  which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death rock and rolledit johnsons greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death rock and roll and rock the rock and roll hall of fame included four of his songs in a set of  they deemed to have shaped the genre “sweet home chicago”  “cross road blues”  “hellhound on my trail”  “love in vain”  johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the advent of rock and roll dying a year or two later the rock and roll hall of fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony in  almost a half century after his death marc meyers of the wall street journal wrote that his stop breakin down blues from  is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in  rock music and related genresedit many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by johnson the most injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections are prominent rock musicians from the united kingdom his impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define rock and roll and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in  by columbia records king of the delta blues singers brian jones of the rolling stones introduced his bandmate keith richards to this album by johnson the blues masters recordings would have as much impact on him as on mick jagger the group performed his walkin blues at the rock and roll circus in  they arranged their own version of love in vain for their album let it bleed and recorded stop breakin down blues for exile on main street jagger in the role of turner in the  film performance performed excerpts from come on in my kitchen and me and the devil blues alexis korner who has been called the founding father of british blues cowrote and recorded a song entitled robert johnson for the party album released in  other examples of the influence he had on english blues and bluesrock musicians and musical groups include the following eric clapton considers johnson the most important blues musician who ever lived he recorded enough of his songs to make me and mr johnson a bluesrock album released in  as a tribute to the legendary bluesman it was also used in the film sessions for robert j he earlier recorded crossroads an arrangement of cross road blues with cream in  leading some to consider him the man largely responsible for making robert johnson a household name robert plant of led zeppelin referred to johnson on the npr radio program fresh air recorded in  as “robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way” his group recorded traveling riverside blues a song that drew from johnsons original and quoted a number of his songs the accompanying music video showed images from the delta which johnson often wrote about fleetwood mac was strongly influenced by johnson in the groups early years as a british blues band guitarist jeremy spencer contributed two covers of johnsonderived songs to the groups early albums and lead guitarist peter green later recorded johnsons entire catalogue in two albums the robert johnson songbook and hot foot powder sam dunns documentary metal evolution cites johnson as the great grandfather to all things heavy metal with members of the bands rush and slipknot agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music bob dylan wrote of johnson in his  autobiography chronicles volume one if i hadnt heard the robert johnson record when i did there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that i wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write guitar techniqueedit l gibson guitar subsequently reissued by gibson as a tribute to johnson johnsons revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary experts assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time in  spin magazine rated him first in its list of  guitar gods—on the nd anniversary of his death in  rolling stone magazine ranked him fifth on their list of  greatest guitarists of all time— years after he died in  guitarcom ranked him ninth in its list of top  guitarists of all time— years after he died musicians who proclaim johnsons profound impact on them—including keith richards jimi hendrix and eric clapton—all rated in the top ten with him on each of

claud use in advertisementsedit johnsons recordings such as sweet home chicago have been used by companies and nonprofit organizations for marketing purposes sweet home chicago is played at many events in chicago problems of biographyedit the thing about robert johnson was that he only existed on his records he was pure legend –martin scorsese love in vain a vision of robert johnson very little of johnsons early life is known with certainty two marriage licenses for johnson have been located in county records offices the ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates as do the entries showing his attendance at indian creek school in tunica mississippi that he was not listed among his mothers children in the  census casts further doubt on these dates carrie thompson claimed that her mother who was also roberts mother remembered his birth date as may   the  census gives his age as  suggesting he was born in  or  five significant dates from his career are documented monday thursday and friday november   and   at a recording session in san antonio texas and saturday and sunday june  and   at a recording session in dallas his death certificate discovered in  lists the date and location of his death johnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release and efforts were made to discover his biography with virtually no success the blues researcher mack mccormick began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings mccormicks research eventually became as much a legend as johnson himself in  mccormick permitted peter guralnick to publish a summary in living blues  later reprinted in book form as searching for robert johnson later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details a revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by stephen lavere for the booklet accompanying the compilation album robert johnson the complete recordings  and is maintained with updates at the delta haze website the documentary film the search for robert johnson contains accounts by mccormick and wardlow of what informants have told them long interviews of david honeyboy edwards and johnny shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family these published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts a relatively full account of johnsons brief musical career emerged in the s largely from accounts by son house johnny shines david honeyboy edwards and robert lockwood in  the sleeve notes to the album king of the delta blues singers included reminiscences of don law who had recorded johnson in  law added to the mystique surrounding johnson representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy photographsedit the two confirmed images of johnson were located in  in the possession of his halfsister carrie thompson but were not widely published until the late s a third photo purporting to show johnson posing with the blues musician johnny shines was published in the november  issue of vanity fair magazine it was declared authentic by the forensic artist lois gibson and by johnsons estate in  the authenticity of the third photo has been disputed by some music historians including elijah wald bruce conforth and gayle dean wardlow who considered that the clothing suggests a date after johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched in december  a fourth photograph was published purportedly showing johnson his wife calletta craft estella coleman and robert lockwood jr this photograph was also declared authentic by lois gibson but her identification of johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians in his book searching for robert johnson peter guralnick stated that the blues archivist mack mccormick showed him a photograph of johnson with his nephew louis probably taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph showing louis dressed in his united states navy uniform this photograph has never been made public playback speed hypothesisedit in the guardians music blog from may  jon wilde speculated that johnsons recordings may have been accidentally speeded up when first committed to  rpm records or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting he did not give a source for this statement biographer elijah wald and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds including that johnsons extant recordings were made on five different days spread across two years at two different studios making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable in addition fellow musicians contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than  years preceding wildes hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered descendantsedit johnson left no will in  the mississippi supreme court ruled that claud johnson a retired truck driver living in crystal springs mississippi was the son of robert johnson and his sole heir the court heard that he had been born to virgie jane smith later virgie jane cain who had a relationship with robert johnson in  the relationship was attested to by a friend eula mae williams but other relatives descended from robert johnsons halfsister carrie harris thompson contested claud johnsons claim the effect of the judgment was to allow claud johnson to receive over  million in royalties claud johnson died aged  on june   leaving six children discographyedit main article robert johnson discography traveling riverside blues cross road

johnson born december  julia was married to charles dodds born february  a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker with whom she had ten children charles dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners julia left hazlehurst with baby robert but after two years sent the boy to memphis to live with her husband who had changed his name to charles spencer about  robert rejoined his mother in the mississippi delta area around tunica and robinsonville mississippi julias new husband known as dusty willis was  years her junior robert was remembered by some residents as little robert dusty but he was registered at tunicas indian creek school as robert spencer in the  census he is listed as robert spencer living in lucas arkansas with will and julia willis robert was at school in  and  the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background a school friend willie coffee who was interviewed and filmed in later life recalled that as a youth robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp coffee recalled that robert was absent for long periods which suggests that he may have been living and studying in memphis after school robert adopted the surname of his natural father signing himself as robert johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteenyearold virginia travis in february  she died in childbirth shortly after surviving relatives of virginia told the blues researcher robert mack mccormick that this was a divine punishment for roberts decision to sing secular songs known as selling your soul to the devil mccormick believed that johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a fulltime blues musician around this time the blues musician son house moved to robinsonville where his musical partner willie brown lived late in life house remembered johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist soon after johnson left robinsonville for the area around martinsville close to his birthplace possibly searching for his natural father here he perfected the guitar style of house and learned other styles from isaiah ike zinnerman zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight when johnson next appeared in robinsonville he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique house was interviewed at a time when the legend of johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers he was asked whether he attributed johnsons technique to this pact and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation while living in martinsville johnson fathered a child with vergie mae smith he married caletta craft in may  in  the couple moved to clarksdale mississippi in the delta here caletta died in childbirth and johnson left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician itinerant musicianedit from  until his death in  johnson moved frequently between cities like memphis tennessee and helena arkansas and the smaller towns of the mississippi delta and neighboring regions of mississippi and arkansas on occasion he traveled much farther the blues musician johnny shines accompanied him to chicago texas new york canada kentucky and indiana henry townsend shared a musical engagement with him in st louis in many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends he did not marry again but formed some longterm relationships with women to whom he would return periodically one was estella coleman the mother of the blues musician robert lockwood jr in other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance in each location johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere he used different names in different places employing at least eight distinct surnames biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew johnson in different contexts shines who traveled extensively with him lockwood who knew him as his mothers partner david honeyboy edwards whose cousin willie mae powell had a relationship with johnson from a mass of partial conflicting and inconsistent eyewitness accounts biographers have attempted to summarize johnsons character he was well mannered he was soft spoken he was indecipherable as for his character everyone seems to agree that while he was pleasant and outgoing in public in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way musicians who knew johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except of course for his musical talent his weakness for whiskey and women and his commitment to the road when johnson arrived in a new town he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant musical associates have said that in live performances johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions but instead pleased audiences by performing more wellknown pop standards of the day – and not necessarily blues with an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music he also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience in every town in which he stopped he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later shines was  when he met johnson in  he estimated johnson was maybe a year older than himself shines is quoted describing johnson in samuel charterss robert johnson robert was a very friendly person even though he was sulky at times you know and i hung around robert for quite a while one evening he disappeared he was kind of a peculiar fellow robertd be standing up playing some place playing like nobodys business at about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure and moneyd be coming from all directions but robertd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing and you wouldnt see robert no more maybe in two or three weeks  so robert and i we began journeying off i was just matter of fact tagging along during this time johnson established what would be a relatively longterm relationship with estella coleman a woman about  years his senior and the mother of the musician robert lockwood jr johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in he reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them and in most cases he was accepted until a boyfriend arrived or johnson was ready to move on in  alan lomax learned from muddy waters that johnson had performed in the area around clarksdale mississippi by  the historian samuel charters could add only that will shade of the memphis jug band remembered johnson had once briefly played with him in west memphis arkansas in the last year of his life johnson is believed to have traveled to st louis and possibly illinois and then to some states in the east in  columbia records producer john h hammond who owned some of johnsons records directed the record producer don law seek out johnson to book him for the first from spirituals to swing concert at carnegie hall in new york on learning of johnsons death hammond replaced him with big bill broonzy but he played two of johnsons records from the stage recording sessionsedit johnsons recordings were released by several record companies milkcows calf blues by perfect love in vain blues by vocalion and i believe ill dust my broom by conqueror in jackson mississippi around  johnson sought out h c speir who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout speir put johnson in touch with ernie oertle who as a salesman for the arc group of labels introduced johnson to don law to record his first sessions in san antonio texas the recording session was held on november   in room  of the gunter hotel in san antonio which brunswick records had set up to be a temporary recording studio in the ensuing threeday session johnson played  selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them he reportedly performed facing the wall which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer this conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the  album king of the delta blues singers the slide guitarist ry cooder speculates that johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar a technique he calls corner loading among the songs johnson recorded in san antonio were come on in my kitchen kind hearted woman blues i believe ill dust my broom and cross road blues the first to be released were terraplane blues and last fair deal gone down probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear terraplane blues became a modest regional hit selling  copies his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues was part of a cycle of spinoffs and response songs that began with leroy carrs mean mistreater mama  according to elijah wald it was the most musically complex in the cycle and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses in contrast to most delta players johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a rpm side most of johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session in  johnson traveled to dallas texas for another recording session with don law in a makeshift studio at the vitagraph warner brothers building at  park avenue where brunswick record corporation was located on the third floor eleven records from this session would be released within the following year johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived because of this there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place johnson recorded almost half of the  songs that make up his entire discography in dallas deathedit johnson died on august   at the age of  near greenwood mississippi of unknown causes several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about  miles  km from greenwood according to one theory johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted in an account by the blues musician sonny boy williamson johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband when johnson took the bottle williamson knocked it out of his hand admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened johnson replied dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand soon after he was offered another poisoned bottle and accepted it johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours over the next three days his condition steadily worsened witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain the musicologist robert mack mccormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview but he declined to reveal the mans name while strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed johnson at least one scholar has disputed the notion tom graves in his book crossroads the life and afterlife of blues legend robert johnson relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised even in strong liquor graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal and that death from the poison would occur within hours not days johnsons contemporary david honeyboy edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine since johnson would have died much more rapidly instead of suffering for three dayscitation needed the leflore county registrar cornelia jordan after conducting an investigation into johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics r n whitfield wrote on johnsons death certificate i talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and i also talked with a negro woman on the place the plantation owner said the negro man seemingly about  years old came from tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation he stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton the white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him he was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county the plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis gravesiteedit alleged gravesite with one of johnsons three tombstones the exact location of johnsons grave is officially unknown three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside greenwood research in the s and s strongly suggests johnson was buried in the graveyard of the mount zion missionary baptist church near morgan city mississippi not far from greenwood in an unmarked grave a oneton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk listing all of johnsons song titles with a central inscription by peter guralnick was placed at this location in  paid for by columbia records and numerous smaller contributions made through the mt zion memorial fund in  a small marker with the epitaph resting in the blues was placed in the cemetery of payne chapel near quito mississippi by an atlanta rock group named the tombstones after they saw a photograph in living blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of johnsons exgirlfriends to be johnsons burial site more recent research by stephen lavere including statements from rosie eskridge the wife of the supposed gravedigger indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the little zion church north of greenwood along money road through lavere sony music placed a marker at this site which bears laveres name as well as johnsons an interviewee in the documentary the search for robert johnson  suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave or potters field very near where he died devil legendedit according to legend as a young man living on a plantation in rural mississippi johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician he was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near dockery plantation at midnight there he was met by a large black man the devil who took the guitar and tuned it the devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to johnson giving him mastery of the instrument this was a deal with the devil mirroring the legend of faust in exchange for his soul johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous various accountsedit this legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by gayle dean wardlow edward komara and elijah wald who sees the legend as largely dating from johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death son house once told the story to pete welding as an explanation of johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in down beat in  other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from house and there were fully two years between houses observation of johnson as first a novice and then a master further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by greil marcus and robert palmer most significantly the detail was added that johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads there is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the robert johnson story all the published evidence including a full chapter on the subject in the biography crossroads by tom graves suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician tommy johnson this story was collected from his musical associate ishman bracey and his elder brother ledell in the s one version of ledell johnsons account was published in david evanss  biography of tommy johnson and was repeated in print in  alongside houses story in the widely read searching for robert johnson by peter guralnick in another version ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard this resembles the story told to steve lavere that ike zinnerman of hazlehurst mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young johnson the legendary crossroads at clarksdale mississippi recent research by the blues scholar bruce conforth in living blues magazine makes the story clearer johnson and ike zimmerman the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early s on his social security card and social security death notice on his funeral program and by his daughters did practice in a graveyard at night because it was quiet and no one would disturb them but it was not the hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed zimmerman was not from hazlehurst but nearby beauregard mississippi and he didnt practice in one graveyard but in several in the area johnson spent about a year living with and learning from zimmerman who ultimately accompanied johnson back to the delta to look after him while dockery hazlehurst and beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads there are also tourist attractions claiming to be the crossroads in both clarksdale and memphis residents of rosedale mississippi claim johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of highways  and  in their town while the  movie crossroads was filmed in beulah mississippi the blues historian steve cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads because robert johnson was a rambling guy interpretationsedit folklorist alan lomax who was instrumental in preserving johnsons recordings and spreading the mythology about his skill some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the christian figure of satan but also to the african trickster god legba himself associated with crossroads folklorist harry m hyatt wrote that during his research in the south from  to  when africanamericans born in the th or early th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads they had a different meaning in mind hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating african religious retentions surrounding legba and the making of a deal not selling the soul in the same sense as in the faustian tradition cited by graves with the socalled devil at the crossroads the blues and the blues singer has really special powers over women especially it is said that the blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted and so when robert johnson came back having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics people said he must have sold his soul to the devil and that fits in with this old african association with the crossroads where you find wisdom you go down to the crossroads to learn and in his case to learn in a faustian pact with the devil you sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history this view that the devil in johnsons songs is derived from an african deity was disputed by the blues scholar david evans in an essay published in  demythologizing the blues there are  several serious problems with this crossroads myth the devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore and nowhere do blues singers ever mention legba or any other african deity in their songs or other lore the actual african music connected with cults of legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral callandresponse singing the musicologist alan lomax dismissed the myth stating in fact every blues fiddler banjo picker harp blower piano strummer and guitar framer was in the opinion of both himself and his peers a child of the devil a consequence of the black view of the european dance embrace as sinful in the extreme musical styleedit johnson is considered a master of the blues particularly of the delta blues style keith richards of the rolling stones said in  you want to know how good the blues can get well this is it but according to elijah wald in his book escaping the delta johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues in contrast to the prevailing delta style of the time more resembled the style of chicago or st louis with a fullfledged abundantly varied musical arrangement unusual for a delta player of the time a recording exhibits what johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style theyre red hot from his first recording session shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the harlem hamfats but as wald remarked no record company was heading to mississippi in search of a downhome ink spots  he could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them the journalist marc myers wrote to the uninitiated johnsons recordings may sound like just another dusty delta blues musician wailing away but a careful listen reveals that johnson was a revisionist in his time johnsons tortured soul vocals and anxietyridden guitar playing arent found in the cottonfield blues of his contemporaries voiceedit an important aspect of johnsons singing was his use of microtonality these subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion eric clapton described johnsons music as the most powerful cry that i think you can find in the human voice in two takes of me and the devil blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse the range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing the songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked generations of blues writers in search of wild delta primitivism wrote wald have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show johnson as a polished professional performer johnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song a technique later perfected by b b king and his personified guitar named lucille in africa and in afroamerican tradition there is the tradition of the talking instrument beginning with the drums  the onestrand and then the sixstrings with bottleneckstyle performance it becomes a competing voice or a complementary voice  in the performance bob dylan wrote that when johnson started singing he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of zeus in full armor i immediately differentiated between him and anyone else i had ever heard the songs werent customary blues songs they were so utterly fluid at first they went by quick too quick to even get they jumped all over the place in range and subject matter short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic storyfires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic instrumentedit johnson mastered the guitar being considered today one of the alltime greats on the instrument his approach was complex and musically advanced when keith richards was first introduced to johnsons music by his bandmate brian jones he asked who is the other guy playing with him not realizing it was johnson playing one guitar i was hearing two guitars and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself said richards who later stated that robert johnson was like an orchestra all by himself as for his guitar technique its politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from henpicking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chuckachucka rhythm figures lyricsedit in the story with dick gordon bill ferris of american public media said robert johnson i think of in the same way i think of the british romantic poets keats and shelley who burned out early who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry  the blues if anything are deeply sexual you know my car doesnt run im gonna check my oil  if you dont like my apples dont shake my tree every verse has sexuality associated with it influencesedit johnson fused approaches specific to delta blues to those from the broader music world the slide guitar work on rambling on my mind is pure delta and johnsons vocal there has a touch of  son house rawness but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of delta blues—it is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville johnson did record versions of preaching the blues and walking blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style houses chronology has been questioned by guralnick as with the first take of come on in my kitchen the influence of skip james is evident in jamess devil got my woman but the lyrics rise to the level of firstrate poetry and johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output the sad romantic love in vain successfully blends several of johnsons disparate influences the form including the wordless last verse follows leroy carrs last hit when the sun goes down the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song blind lemon jefferson recorded in  johnsons last recording milkcows calf blues is his most direct tribute to kokomo arnold who wrote milkcow blues and influenced johnsons vocal style from four until late shows johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the delta he croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of lonnie johnson and his guitar style is more that of a ragtimeinfluenced player like blind blake lonnie johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual delta style malted milk and drunken hearted man both copy the arrangement of lonnie johnsons life saver blues the two takes of me and the devil blues show the influence of peetie wheatstraw calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heartcry of a demondriven folk artist legacyedit johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous his influence on contemporaries was much smaller in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners in juke joints and at saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music he also died young after recording only a handful of songs johnson though welltraveled and admired in his performances was little noted in his lifetime and his records were even less appreciated terraplane blues sometimes described as johnsons only hit record outsold his others but was still only a minor success if one had asked black blues fans about johnson in the first twenty years after his death writes elijah wald the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled robert who this lack of recognition extended to black musicians as far as the evolution of black music goes robert johnson was an extremely minor figure and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note columbia records released the album king of the delta blues singers a compilation of johnsons recordings in  which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death rock and rolledit johnsons greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death rock and roll and rock the rock and roll hall of fame included four of his songs in a set of  they deemed to have shaped the genre “sweet home chicago”  “cross road blues”  “hellhound on my trail”  “love in vain”  johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the advent of rock and roll dying a year or two later the rock and roll hall of fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony in  almost a half century after his death marc meyers of the wall street journal wrote that his stop breakin down blues from  is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in  rock music and related genresedit many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by johnson the most injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections are prominent rock musicians from the united kingdom his impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define rock and roll and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in  by columbia records king of the delta blues singers brian jones of the rolling stones introduced his bandmate keith richards to this album by johnson the blues masters recordings would have as much impact on him as on mick jagger the group performed his walkin blues at the rock and roll circus in  they arranged their own version of love in vain for their album let it bleed and recorded stop breakin down blues for exile on main street jagger in the role of turner in the  film performance performed excerpts from come on in my kitchen and me and the devil blues alexis korner who has been called the founding father of british blues cowrote and recorded a song entitled robert johnson for the party album released in  other examples of the influence he had on english blues and bluesrock musicians and musical groups include the following eric clapton considers johnson the most important blues musician who ever lived he recorded enough of his songs to make me and mr johnson a bluesrock album released in  as a tribute to the legendary bluesman it was also used in the film sessions for robert j he earlier recorded crossroads an arrangement of cross road blues with cream in  leading some to consider him the man largely responsible for making robert johnson a household name robert plant of led zeppelin referred to johnson on the npr radio program fresh air recorded in  as “robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way” his group recorded traveling riverside blues a song that drew from johnsons original and quoted a number of his songs the accompanying music video showed images from the delta which johnson often wrote about fleetwood mac was strongly influenced by johnson in the groups early years as a british blues band guitarist jeremy spencer contributed two covers of johnsonderived songs to the groups early albums and lead guitarist peter green later recorded johnsons entire catalogue in two albums the robert johnson songbook and hot foot powder sam dunns documentary metal evolution cites johnson as the great grandfather to all things heavy metal with members of the bands rush and slipknot agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music bob dylan wrote of johnson in his  autobiography chronicles volume one if i hadnt heard the robert johnson record when i did there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that i wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write guitar techniqueedit l gibson guitar subsequently reissued by gibson as a tribute to johnson johnsons revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary experts assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time in  spin magazine rated him first in its list of  guitar gods—on the nd anniversary of his death in  rolling stone magazine ranked him fifth on their list of  greatest guitarists of all time— years after he died in  guitarcom ranked him ninth in its list of top

little of johnsons early life is known with certainty two marriage licenses for johnson have been located in county records offices the ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates as do the entries showing his attendance at indian creek school in tunica mississippi that he was not listed among his mothers children in the  census casts further doubt on these dates carrie

in  lists the date and location of his death johnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release and efforts were made to discover his biography with virtually no success the blues researcher mack mccormick began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings mccormicks research eventually became as much a legend as johnson himself in  mccormick permitted peter guralnick to publish a summary in living blues  later reprinted in book form as searching for robert johnson later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details a revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by stephen lavere for the booklet accompanying the compilation album robert johnson the complete recordings  and is maintained with updates at the delta haze website the documentary film the search for robert johnson contains accounts by mccormick and wardlow of what informants have told them long interviews of david honeyboy edwards and johnny shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family these published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts a relatively full account of johnsons brief musical career emerged in the s largely from accounts by son house johnny shines david honeyboy edwards and robert lockwood in  the sleeve notes to the album king of the delta blues singers included reminiscences of don law who had recorded johnson in  law added to the mystique surrounding johnson representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy photographsedit the two confirmed images of johnson were located in  in the possession of his halfsister carrie thompson but were not widely published until the late s a third photo purporting to show johnson posing with the blues musician johnny shines was published in the november  issue of vanity fair magazine it was declared authentic by the forensic artist lois gibson and by johnsons estate in  the authenticity of the third photo has been disputed by some music historians including elijah wald bruce conforth and gayle dean wardlow who considered that the clothing suggests a date after johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched in december  a fourth photograph was published purportedly showing johnson his wife calletta craft estella coleman and robert lockwood jr this photograph was also declared authentic by lois gibson but her identification of johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians in his book searching for robert johnson peter guralnick stated that the blues archivist mack mccormick showed him a photograph of johnson with his nephew louis probably taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph showing louis dressed in his united states navy uniform this photograph has never been made public playback speed hypothesisedit in the guardians music blog from may  jon wilde speculated that johnsons recordings may have been accidentally speeded up when first committed to  rpm records or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting he did not give a source for this statement biographer elijah wald and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds including that johnsons extant recordings were made on five different days spread across two years at two different studios making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable in addition fellow musicians contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than  years preceding wildes hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered descendantsedit johnson left no will in  the mississippi supreme court ruled that claud johnson a retired truck driver living in crystal springs mississippi was

attested to by a friend eula mae williams but other relatives descended from robert johnsons halfsister carrie harris thompson contested claud johnsons claim the effect of the judgment was to allow

johnson born december  julia was married to charles dodds born february  a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker with whom she had ten children charles dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners julia left hazlehurst with baby robert but after two years sent the boy to memphis to live with her husband who had changed his name to charles spencer about  robert rejoined his mother in the mississippi delta area around tunica and robinsonville mississippi julias new husband known as dusty willis was  years her junior robert was remembered by some residents as little robert dusty but he was registered at tunicas indian creek school as robert spencer in the  census he is listed as robert spencer living in lucas arkansas with will and julia willis robert was at school in  and  the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background a school friend willie coffee who was interviewed and filmed in later life recalled that as a youth robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp coffee recalled that robert was absent for long periods which suggests that he may have been living and studying in memphis after school robert adopted the surname of his natural father signing himself as robert johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteenyearold virginia travis in february  she died in childbirth shortly after surviving relatives of virginia told the blues researcher robert mack mccormick that this was a divine punishment for roberts decision to sing secular songs known as selling your soul to the devil mccormick believed that johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a fulltime blues musician around this time the blues musician son house moved to robinsonville where his musical partner willie brown lived late in life house remembered johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist soon after johnson left robinsonville for the area around martinsville close to his birthplace possibly searching for his natural father here he perfected the guitar style of house and learned other styles from isaiah ike zinnerman zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight when johnson next appeared in robinsonville he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique house was interviewed at a time when the legend of johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers he was asked whether he attributed johnsons technique to this pact and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation while living in martinsville johnson fathered a child with vergie mae smith he married caletta craft in may  in  the couple moved to clarksdale mississippi in the delta here caletta died in childbirth and johnson left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician itinerant musicianedit from  until his death in  johnson moved frequently between cities like memphis tennessee and helena arkansas and the smaller towns of the mississippi delta and neighboring regions of mississippi and arkansas on occasion he traveled much farther the blues musician johnny shines accompanied him to chicago texas new york canada kentucky and indiana henry townsend shared a musical engagement with him in st louis in many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends he did not marry again but formed some longterm relationships with women to whom he would return periodically one was estella coleman the mother of the blues musician robert lockwood jr in other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance in each location johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere he used different names in different places employing at least eight distinct surnames biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew johnson in different contexts shines who traveled extensively with him lockwood who knew him as his mothers partner david honeyboy edwards whose cousin willie mae powell had a relationship with johnson from a mass of partial conflicting and inconsistent eyewitness accounts biographers have attempted to summarize johnsons character he was well mannered he was soft spoken he was indecipherable as for his character everyone seems to agree that while he was pleasant and outgoing in public in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way musicians who knew johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except of course for his musical talent his weakness for whiskey and women and his commitment to the road when johnson arrived in a new town he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant musical associates have said that in live performances johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions but instead pleased audiences by performing more wellknown pop standards of the day – and not necessarily blues with an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music he also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience in every town in which he stopped he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later shines was  when he met johnson in  he estimated johnson was maybe a year older than himself shines is quoted describing johnson in samuel charterss robert johnson robert was a very friendly person even though he was sulky at times you know and i hung around robert for quite a while one evening he disappeared he was kind of a peculiar fellow robertd be standing up playing some place playing like nobodys business at about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure and moneyd be coming from all directions but robertd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing and you wouldnt see robert no more maybe in two or three weeks  so robert and i we began journeying off i was just matter of fact tagging along during this time johnson established what would be a relatively longterm relationship with estella coleman a woman about  years his senior and the mother of the musician robert lockwood jr johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in he reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them and in most cases he was accepted until a boyfriend arrived or johnson was ready to move on in  alan lomax learned from muddy waters that johnson had performed in the area around clarksdale mississippi by  the historian samuel charters could add only that will shade of the memphis jug band remembered johnson had once briefly played with him in west memphis arkansas in the last year of his life johnson is believed to have traveled to st louis and possibly illinois and then to some states in the east in  columbia records producer john h hammond who owned some of johnsons records directed the record producer don law seek out johnson to book him for the first from spirituals to swing concert at carnegie hall in new york on learning of johnsons death hammond replaced him with big bill broonzy but he played two of johnsons records from the stage recording sessionsedit johnsons recordings were released by several record companies milkcows calf blues by perfect love in vain blues by vocalion and i believe ill dust my broom by conqueror in jackson mississippi around  johnson sought out h c speir who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout speir put johnson in touch with ernie oertle who as a salesman for the arc group of labels introduced johnson to don law to record his first sessions in san antonio texas the recording session was held on november   in room  of the gunter hotel in san antonio which brunswick records had set up to be a temporary recording studio in the ensuing threeday session johnson played  selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them he reportedly performed facing the wall which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer this conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the  album king of the delta blues singers the slide guitarist ry cooder speculates that johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar a technique he calls corner loading among the songs johnson recorded in san antonio were come on in my kitchen kind hearted woman blues i believe ill dust my broom and cross road blues the first to be released were terraplane blues and last fair deal gone down probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear terraplane blues became a modest regional hit selling  copies his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues was part of a cycle of spinoffs and response songs that began with leroy carrs mean mistreater mama  according to elijah wald it was the most musically complex in the cycle and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses in contrast to most delta players johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a rpm side most of johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session in  johnson traveled to dallas texas for another recording session with don law in a makeshift studio at the vitagraph warner brothers building at  park avenue where brunswick record corporation was located on the third floor eleven records from this session would be released within the following year johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived because of this there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place johnson recorded almost half of the  songs that make up his entire discography in dallas deathedit johnson died on august   at the age of  near greenwood mississippi of unknown causes several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about  miles  km from greenwood according to one theory johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted in an account by the blues musician sonny boy williamson johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband when johnson took the bottle williamson knocked it out of his hand admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened johnson replied dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand soon after he was offered another poisoned bottle and accepted it johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours over the next three days his condition steadily worsened witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain the musicologist robert mack mccormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview but he declined to reveal the mans name while strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed johnson at least one scholar has disputed the notion tom graves in his book crossroads the life and afterlife of blues legend robert johnson relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised even in strong liquor graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal and that death from the poison would occur within hours not days johnsons contemporary david honeyboy edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine since johnson would have died much more rapidly instead of suffering for three dayscitation needed the leflore county registrar cornelia jordan after conducting an investigation into johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics r n whitfield wrote on johnsons death certificate i talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and i also talked with a negro woman on the place the plantation owner said the negro man seemingly about  years old came from tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation he stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton the white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him he was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county the plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis gravesiteedit alleged gravesite with one of johnsons three tombstones the exact location of johnsons grave is officially unknown three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside greenwood research in the s and s strongly suggests johnson was buried in the graveyard of the mount zion missionary baptist church near morgan city mississippi not far from greenwood in an unmarked grave a oneton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk listing all of johnsons song titles with a central inscription by peter guralnick was placed at this location in  paid for by columbia records and numerous smaller contributions made through the mt zion memorial fund in  a small marker with the epitaph resting in the blues was placed in the cemetery of payne chapel near quito mississippi by an atlanta rock group named the tombstones after they saw a photograph in living blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of johnsons exgirlfriends to be johnsons burial site more recent research by stephen lavere including statements from rosie eskridge the wife of the supposed gravedigger indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the little zion church north of greenwood along money road through lavere sony music placed a marker at this site which bears laveres name as well as johnsons an interviewee in the documentary the search for robert johnson  suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave or potters field very near where he died devil legendedit according to legend as a young man living on a plantation in rural mississippi johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician he was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near dockery plantation at midnight there he was met by a large black man the devil who took the guitar and tuned it the devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to johnson giving him mastery of the instrument this was a deal with the devil mirroring the legend of faust in exchange for his soul johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous various accountsedit this legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by gayle dean wardlow edward komara and elijah wald who sees the legend as largely dating from johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death son house once told the story to pete welding as an explanation of johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in down beat in  other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from house and there were fully two years between houses observation of johnson as first a novice and then a master further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by greil marcus and robert palmer most significantly the detail was added that johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads there is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the robert johnson story all the published evidence including a full chapter on the subject in the biography crossroads by tom graves suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician tommy johnson this story was collected from his musical associate ishman bracey and his elder brother ledell in the s one version of ledell johnsons account was published in david evanss  biography of tommy johnson and was repeated in print in  alongside houses story in the widely read searching for robert johnson by peter guralnick in another version ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard this resembles the story told to steve lavere that ike zinnerman of hazlehurst mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young johnson the legendary crossroads at clarksdale mississippi recent research by the blues scholar bruce conforth in living blues magazine makes the story clearer johnson and ike zimmerman the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early s on his social security card and social security death notice on his funeral program and by his daughters did practice in a graveyard at night because it was quiet and no one would disturb them but it was not the hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed zimmerman was not from hazlehurst but nearby beauregard mississippi and he didnt practice in one graveyard but in several in the area johnson spent about a year living with and learning from zimmerman who ultimately accompanied johnson back to the delta to look after him while dockery hazlehurst and beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads there are also tourist attractions claiming to be the crossroads in both clarksdale and memphis residents of rosedale mississippi claim johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of highways  and  in their town while the  movie crossroads was filmed in beulah mississippi the blues historian steve cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads because robert johnson was a rambling guy interpretationsedit folklorist alan lomax who was instrumental in preserving johnsons recordings and spreading the mythology about his skill some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the christian figure of satan but also to the african trickster god legba himself associated with crossroads folklorist harry m hyatt wrote that during his research in the south from  to  when africanamericans born in the th or early th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads they had a different meaning in mind hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating african religious retentions surrounding legba and the making of a deal not selling the soul in the same sense as in the faustian tradition cited by graves with the socalled devil at the crossroads the blues and the blues singer has really special powers over women especially it is said that the blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted and so when robert johnson came back having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics people said he must have sold his soul to the devil and that fits in with this old african association with the crossroads where you find wisdom you go down to the crossroads to learn and in his case to learn in a faustian pact with the devil you sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history this view that the devil in johnsons songs is derived from an african deity was disputed by the blues scholar david evans in an essay published in  demythologizing the blues there are  several serious problems with this crossroads myth the devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore and nowhere do blues singers ever mention legba or any other african deity in their songs or other lore the actual african music connected with cults of legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral callandresponse singing the musicologist alan lomax dismissed the myth stating in fact every blues fiddler banjo picker harp blower piano strummer and guitar framer was in the opinion of both himself and his peers a child of the devil a consequence of the black view of the european dance embrace as sinful in the extreme musical styleedit johnson is considered a master of the blues particularly of the delta blues style keith richards of the rolling stones said in  you want to know how good the blues can get well this is it but according to elijah wald in his book escaping the delta johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song his first recorded song kind hearted woman blues in contrast to the prevailing delta style of the time more resembled the style of chicago or st louis with a fullfledged abundantly varied musical arrangement unusual for a delta player of the time a recording exhibits what johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style theyre red hot from his first recording session shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the harlem hamfats but as wald remarked no record company was heading to mississippi in search of a downhome ink spots  he could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them the journalist marc myers wrote to the uninitiated johnsons recordings may sound like just another dusty delta blues musician wailing away but a careful listen reveals that johnson was a revisionist in his time johnsons tortured soul vocals and anxietyridden guitar playing arent found in the cottonfield blues of his contemporaries voiceedit an important aspect of johnsons singing was his use of microtonality these subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion eric clapton described johnsons music as the most powerful cry that i think you can find in the human voice in two takes of me and the devil blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse the range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing the songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked generations of blues writers in search of wild delta primitivism wrote wald have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show johnson as a polished professional performer johnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song a technique later perfected by b b king and his personified guitar named lucille in africa and in afroamerican tradition there is the tradition of the talking instrument beginning with the drums  the onestrand and then the sixstrings with bottleneckstyle performance it becomes a competing voice or a complementary voice  in the performance bob dylan wrote that when johnson started singing he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of zeus in full armor i immediately differentiated between him and anyone else i had ever heard the songs werent customary blues songs they were so utterly fluid at first they went by quick too quick to even get they jumped all over the place in range and subject matter short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic storyfires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic instrumentedit johnson mastered the guitar being considered today one of the alltime greats on the instrument his approach was complex and musically advanced when keith richards was first introduced to johnsons music by his bandmate brian jones he asked who is the other guy playing with him not realizing it was johnson playing one guitar i was hearing two guitars and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself said richards who later stated that robert johnson was like an orchestra all by himself as for his guitar technique its politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from henpicking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chuckachucka rhythm figures lyricsedit in the story with dick gordon bill ferris of american public media said robert johnson i think of in the same way i think of the british romantic poets keats and shelley who burned out early who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry  the blues if anything are deeply sexual you know my car doesnt run im gonna check my oil  if you dont like my apples dont shake my tree every verse has sexuality associated with it influencesedit johnson fused approaches specific to delta blues to those from the broader music world the slide guitar work on rambling on my mind is pure delta and johnsons vocal there has a touch of  son house rawness but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of delta blues—it is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville johnson did record versions of preaching the blues and walking blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style houses chronology has been questioned by guralnick as with the first take of come on in my kitchen the influence of skip james is evident in jamess devil got my woman but the lyrics rise to the level of firstrate poetry and johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output the sad romantic love in vain successfully blends several of johnsons disparate influences the form including the wordless last verse follows leroy carrs last hit when the sun goes down the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song blind lemon jefferson recorded in  johnsons last recording milkcows calf blues is his most direct tribute to kokomo arnold who wrote milkcow blues and influenced johnsons vocal style from four until late shows johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the delta he croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of lonnie johnson and his guitar style is more that of a ragtimeinfluenced player like blind blake lonnie johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual delta style malted milk and drunken hearted man both copy the arrangement of lonnie johnsons life saver blues the two takes of me and the devil blues show the influence of peetie wheatstraw calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heartcry of a demondriven folk artist legacyedit johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous his influence on contemporaries was much smaller in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners in juke joints and at saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music he also died young after recording only a handful of songs johnson though welltraveled and admired in his performances was little noted in his lifetime and his records were even less appreciated terraplane blues sometimes described as johnsons only hit record outsold his others but was still only a minor success if one had asked black blues fans about johnson in the first twenty years after his death writes elijah wald the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled robert who this lack of recognition extended to black musicians as far as the evolution of black music goes robert johnson was an extremely minor figure and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note columbia records released the album king of the delta blues singers a compilation of johnsons recordings in  which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death rock and rolledit johnsons greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death rock and roll and rock the rock and roll hall of fame included four of his songs in a set of  they deemed to have shaped the genre “sweet home chicago”  “cross road blues”  “hellhound on my trail”  “love in vain”  johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the advent of rock and roll dying a year or two later the rock and roll hall of fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony in  almost a half century after his death marc meyers of the wall street journal wrote that his stop breakin down blues from  is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in  rock music and related genresedit many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by johnson the most injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections are prominent rock musicians from the united kingdom his impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define rock and roll and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in  by columbia records king of the delta blues singers brian jones of the rolling stones introduced his bandmate keith richards to this album by johnson the blues masters recordings would have as much impact on him as on mick jagger the group performed his walkin blues at the rock and roll circus in  they arranged their own version of love in vain for their album let it bleed and recorded stop breakin down blues for exile on main street jagger in the role of turner in the  film performance performed excerpts from come on in my kitchen and me and the devil blues alexis korner who has been called the founding father of british blues cowrote and recorded a song entitled robert johnson for the party album released in  other examples of the influence he had on english blues and bluesrock musicians and musical groups include the following eric clapton considers johnson the most important blues musician who ever lived he recorded enough of his songs to make me and mr johnson a bluesrock album released in  as a tribute to the legendary bluesman it was also used in the film sessions for robert j he earlier recorded crossroads an arrangement of cross road blues with cream in  leading some to consider him the man largely responsible for making robert johnson a household name robert plant of led zeppelin referred to johnson on the npr radio program fresh air recorded in  as “robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way” his group recorded traveling riverside blues a song that drew from johnsons original and quoted a number of his songs the accompanying music video showed images from the delta which johnson often wrote about fleetwood mac was strongly influenced by johnson in the groups early years as a british blues band guitarist jeremy spencer contributed two covers of johnsonderived songs to the groups early albums and lead guitarist peter green later recorded johnsons entire catalogue in two albums the robert johnson songbook and hot foot powder sam dunns documentary metal evolution cites johnson as the great grandfather to all things heavy metal with members of the bands rush and slipknot agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music bob dylan wrote of johnson in his  autobiography chronicles volume one if i hadnt heard the robert johnson record when i did there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that i wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write guitar techniqueedit l gibson guitar subsequently reissued by gibson as a tribute to johnson johnsons revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary experts assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time in  spin magazine rated him first in its list of  guitar gods—on the nd anniversary of his death in  rolling stone magazine ranked him fifth on their list of  greatest guitarists of all time— years after he died in  guitarcom ranked him ninth in its list of top  guitarists of all time— years after he died musicians who proclaim johnsons profound impact on them—including keith richards jimi hendrix and eric clapton—all rated in the top ten with him on each of these lists the boogie bass line he fashioned for i believe ill dust my broom has now passed into the standard guitar repertoire at the time it was completely new a guitarists version of something people would otherwise have heard only from a piano lifetime achievementedit the complete recordings a doubledisc boxed set released by sonycolumbia legacy on august   containing almost everything johnson ever recorded with all  recordings and  alternate takes won a grammy award for “best historical album” that year in  johnson was awarded a grammy lifetime achievement award accepted by his son claud use in advertisementsedit johnsons recordings such as sweet home chicago have been used by companies and nonprofit organizations for marketing purposes sweet home chicago is played at many events in chicago problems of biographyedit the thing about robert johnson was that he only existed on his records he was pure legend –martin scorsese love in vain a vision of robert johnson very little of johnsons early life is known with certainty two marriage licenses for johnson have been located in county records offices the ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates as do the entries showing his attendance at indian creek school in tunica mississippi that he was not listed among his mothers children in the  census casts further doubt on these dates carrie thompson claimed that her mother who was also roberts mother remembered his birth date as may   the  census gives his age as  suggesting he was born in  or  five significant dates from his career are documented monday thursday and friday november   and   at a recording session in san antonio texas and saturday and sunday june  and   at a recording session in dallas his death certificate discovered in  lists the date and location of his death johnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release and efforts were made to discover his biography with virtually no success the blues researcher mack mccormick began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings mccormicks research eventually became as much a legend as johnson himself in  mccormick permitted peter guralnick to publish a summary in living blues  later reprinted in book form as searching for robert johnson later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details a revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by stephen lavere for the booklet accompanying the compilation album robert johnson the complete recordings  and is maintained with updates at the delta haze website the documentary film the search for robert johnson contains accounts by mccormick and wardlow of what informants have told them long interviews of david honeyboy edwards and johnny shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family these published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts a relatively full account of johnsons brief musical career emerged in the s largely from accounts by son house johnny shines david honeyboy edwards and robert lockwood in  the sleeve notes to the album king of the delta blues singers included reminiscences of don law who had recorded johnson in  law added to the mystique surrounding johnson representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy photographsedit the two confirmed images of johnson were located in  in the possession of his halfsister carrie thompson but were not widely published until the late s a third photo purporting to show johnson posing with the blues musician johnny shines was published in the november  issue of vanity fair magazine it was declared authentic by the forensic artist lois gibson and by johnsons estate in  the authenticity of the third photo has been disputed by some music historians including elijah wald bruce conforth and gayle dean wardlow who considered that the clothing suggests a date after johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched in december  a fourth photograph was published purportedly showing johnson his wife calletta craft estella coleman and robert lockwood jr this photograph was also declared authentic by lois gibson but her identification of johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians in his book searching for robert johnson peter guralnick stated that the blues archivist mack mccormick showed him a photograph of johnson with his nephew louis probably taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph showing louis dressed in his united states navy uniform this photograph has never been made public playback speed hypothesisedit in the guardians music blog from may  jon wilde speculated that johnsons recordings may have been accidentally speeded up when first committed to  rpm records or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting he did not give a source for this statement biographer elijah wald and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds including that johnsons extant recordings were made on five different days spread across two years at two different studios making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable in addition fellow musicians contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than  years preceding wildes hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered descendantsedit johnson left no will in  the mississippi supreme court ruled that claud johnson a retired truck driver living in crystal springs mississippi was the son of robert johnson and his sole heir the court heard that he had been born to virgie jane smith later virgie jane cain who had a relationship with robert johnson in  the relationship was attested to by a friend eula mae williams but other relatives descended from robert johnsons halfsister carrie harris thompson contested claud johnsons claim the effect of the judgment was to allow claud johnson to receive over  million in royalties claud johnson died aged  on june   leaving six children discographyedit main article robert johnson discography traveling riverside blues cross road
