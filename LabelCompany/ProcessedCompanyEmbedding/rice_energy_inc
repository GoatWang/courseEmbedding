like at a big company where the landowner is just a number” – enon oh they are very friendly very personal down to earth they’re a big oil and gas company and i’m just a normal person but they treat me like i’m on the same latitude as they are – jerusalem oh “they just seem to be a down home type of operation they make you feel comfortable you feel relaxed being with them or around them they don’t make you feel like you’re just a nobody or someone off the street i can only speak for me but i don’t feel that way” – jacobsburg oh “they’re more of a family owned company than a huge
