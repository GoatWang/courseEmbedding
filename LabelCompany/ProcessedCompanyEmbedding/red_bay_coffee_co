slowmoney investor lisbet tellefsen more investors more investors details expand all how did you get started we started in the coffee business when we opened a small cafe in north berkeley called guerrilla cafe in  that led to opening a second cafe chasing lions at ccsf which sparked an interest in digging deeper into the coffee production side of the business there was a specialty coffee movement that began gaining momentum and we hopped on for the ride im interested in roasted coffee for the artistic and culinary experience of iti find the whole process fascinating i mean if you think about it how does a single ingredient produce so many different results in taste just a single coffee bean with the addition of some variables creates a world of flavor and complexity on the business side of things the whole business model of roasting as opposed to operating a cafe is also equally interesting to me with a cafe a brick and mortar location the world revolves in and out of your door when you get on the wholesale roasting side of the industry however you get much more movement you’re in and out of other people’s doors other local businesses and eventually other locations worldwide we’re sourcing our coffee beans from beautiful places where they’re grown to create a beautiful experience for our customers what makes your coffee company unique we believe in transparent sourcing where consumers are aware of where these coffee beans are coming from the farm conditions and the human and environmental impact to ensure excellent quality we continuously work on rd research and development to achieve delicious coffee there’s a lot of evaluation scrutiny and quality control involved in this process we have a lot of comparison tasting to consider new coffees and to check out the landscape of the local coffee competition the people we include in these tastings come from all overwe have a diverse set of taste testers that come from different backgrounds both the experienced and the inexperienced are includedwe do a lot of handholding for our accounts especially for folks who are starting a new operation they may not know anything about coffee but they have passion and a vision and we want to help them succeed these small business owners are folks who want a coffee company that’s going to support them from from the very beginning from designing their cafe and espresso bar to helping them buy equipment train their staff and select which coffees to serve we just had a couple of brand new cafes accounts open that are serving our coffee we completed an entire ramp up and onboarding of this process to help them build high quality coffee programs which has been excitingin terms of social impact we’re doing a lot of work in direct trade with farmers fair trade obtaining better prices and building a company that offers positive social and environmental impact we’re setting up a profit sharing model with the goal of helping our employees resist some of the displacement that’s occurring in our community as well as hiring and training some formerly incarcerated team members how exactly do you source your coffee we have strong direct trade relationships with several companies from different countries including tanzania where we’ve partnered with a farm called sweet unity farm it is a coop founded by david robinson the younger son of the famous baseball player jackie robinson who has been growing amazing coffee for around  years in africa we’re really interested in the stories of communities like that where farmers have a livable wage we actually send back a share of the retail price on top of the original price we paid just for the crops in indonesia we have partnered with a coop there and met farmer named foster who’s doing some amazing work in high quality beans historically farmers in the region have been exploited by coffee buyers it becomes difficult for farmers who are trying to create a better product in these situations because they don’t have the resources necessary to experiment innovate and do new things it takes much more than what they’re being paid rock bottom commodity prices to grow coffee to make a real living and to generate enough incentive for them to experiment so we agreed to pay this farmer a higher price probably triple his normal price for higher quality he’s quadrupled the quality and now utilizes environmentally responsible practices taught to him by a usda certified agriculturalist what makes the coffee itself so special even in our name red bay coffee we chose the color red to represent us because red is the color of the coffee cherry coffee is a fruit which grows on a shrub and its fruit is called a cherry these cherries are even similar to tomatoes where they start green and go through the whole kind of spectrum development what most coffee farms do is when most of the cherries are ripe theyll just harvest them all with either machines or by hand youll get this spectrum of ripe and almost ripe and passed ripe cherries which turns into coffee what we do is incentivize these farmers by paying them only for the ripe cherries we know that this is extra work because they have to go pass the same tree on multiple days we have them do this to ensure the highest quality possible that’s the big difference on how we get our coffee how do you measure quality coffee is measured by taste and it’s also scored taste is on one hand a very subjective experience you could take something and like it or dislike it but you and i are both tasting something that is for example clearly salty you may or may not like salt but what we try to do in our coffee is calibrate our palettes to that of the general scoring guide its kind of mind blowing that there is this scale  but in specialty coffee its  if it’s not above a score of  it doesnt even qualify specialty coffee by definition is higher quality coffeeby scoring coffee you place a serious financial consequence on that product depending on what score it was given the whole the value chain is impacted the farmer the exporter the importer the roaster the cafe etc they’re scored based on quality taste after taste mouthfeel affinity and each of these scores add up the more experience you have in doing this remarkably peoples’ scores come down to within a few points of each other that’s how this process becomes more objective how do you measure the success of your product when people try us once and then come back buy another bag or another cup or choose our coffee over another coffee we can quantitatively see the success up to now thats been our main gauge of how were doing in the public competition arena we have over sixty wholesale accounts some of which are pretty big office accounts in the tech world we’re the coffee supplier for uber headquarters in san francisco in rotation at salesforce twitter facebook ideo and sungevity we have a few more that we’re negotiating with tell us about the sales process there’s two different paths to closing these office accounts we basically approach the food and beverage director of the company directly internal approach or the food service company that provides their food and coffee for them externally so the company can either tell the beveragefood company that they want red bay coffee or we pitch the service company to convince them to use our product we introduce who we are and then we try to get them over to our place for coffee tasting or we submit samples we use our network to find a way “in” we try to find connections within those companies to help get us an introduction to the decision maker why do customers return to red bay for their coffee we lead with quality you can develop a great brand a great story and a great social mission which will get many people to try your product once but if the quality’s not really stellar or up to standard you are not going to have repeat business brand and csr will only get you so far we strive to lead with excellent quality coffee great service and social missionin that order with that being said i do think that customers come to us because of a combination of those three things who are your customers i would say about  is wholesale and  is retail online sales farmers market new markets popups and catering of that  wholesale approximately  specialty markets  cafesrestaurants  offices we have pretty diversified channels how do your prices compare with other brands our prices are more in line with companies like sightglass and blue bottle because i didnt really want to compete with those companies in terms of price we are going after the same segment as those companies but we are smaller than most of them we’re not buying nearly the same volume of beans so we dont really have the same price advantages we’re charging as much as they are what do you get about the business that your competitors don’t i’ve already talked about the importance of quality brand and impact but i want to emphasize social impact we value the idea of inclusivity and diversity in the workplace and i’m starting to see other companies catch onto the idea as well in their hiring practices we need people who come from different backgrounds with different talents in order to make a company like this be the best it can be we’re not just impacting the world on an environmental level but a social one as well tell us about your profitsharing model and how you plan to expand that moving forward at our only retail space we raised that capital to build the coffee bar from crowdfunding our agreement was that if the public got behind and funded this campaign we would turn over profits to the workers in order to provide a livable wage traditionally retail coffee shop employees are paid low minimum wages there normally aren’t big margins in this industry so this was my idea to raise the needed capital and establish the cafe we had  folks get behind this campaign to make it a reality we’re in a very high profile location so it was a very high profile campaign we’re trying to be an example for other industries and companies that there can be a different way we would like to find a way to create an even bigger sharing model our projections are hour in addition to our local minimum wage which is  and tips we’re seeing these workers making upwards of hour we’re really trying to push for economic empowerment both here and overseas where we’re sourcing our beans from read all answers view all questions ask a question

bryman  march   the red bay coffee roastery in oakland photo by red bay coffee the last we heard of the inspiringly progressive diversitydriven red bay coffee roasting company of oakland calif they were riding high on a kickstarter win fresh from securing blue bottle’s vacated berkeley farmers market spot and had a converted shipping container café soon to be installed six months later the café has yet to be installed due to a lastminute permitting headache soon to be sorted but the delay hasn’t slowed down progress elsewhere by all accounts red bay is snowballing right along and its founder keba konte is a busy creative man the company has moved out of its cramped production “dojo” and into an expansive squarefoot factory space where their probat l has been joined by a refurbished probat l and a purchased probat ug will arrive sometime within the coming weeks decorated with a beautiful living wall with greenery in the shape of the african continent the space at  e th st has already hosted events and it neighbors a local brewery ale industries as well as a cluster of  artists’ studios in time the company hopes to build a retail component within the space the red bay coffee roastery in oakland photo by red bay coffee the uptick in production helps supply a doubled farmer’s market footprint as the company has since last year secured two more exclusive contracts at bay area markets the hayward farmers market and the newark farmers market on top of that red bay has also become the official coffee provider to the offices of san franciscobased uber technologies inc makers of the uber app “i think what got us to the negotiating table was that they likes our principles of diversity and inclusion” said konte adding “what sealed the deal was the level of engagement that we’re proposing” going far beyond beans and coffee red bay will provide exclusive workshops for uber employees once per month in each of their offices presentations will focus on everything from basic brewing at home to the complete roasting process there will be roundtable discussions with actual coffee producers public cuppings and more “they’re serious about their coffee” said konte “the food and beverage directors there they’ve got a lot of opinions and they’re in san francisco there’s a lot of great coffee here there’s a whole spectrum of tastes and demands from their workers so we’re going to really try to tap into that interest” keba konte and david robinson that’s not all konte’s company has tapped into on top of all this the truly big news is that red bay coffee has purchased an entire container of tanzanian greens from sweet unity farms the acre farm owned and directed by david robinson youngest son of baseball legend and political activist jackie robinson “it is by extremely far the most coffee we’ve ever bought at one time” said konte adding that his company is the exclusive west coast us buyer of sweet unity’s crop for this year robinson has been living in tanzania for roughly  years and growing coffee for  of them in “relative obscurity” according to konte who describes robinson as a fascinating character with whom he developed a friendship last summer “first and foremost his coffee is exquisite” said konte “he’s created a really vibrant coop of coffee farmers we’ll be the only ones serving his coffee or roasting it anyway and he’ll be out here in september to participate in a coffee producer roasting residency” konte described robinson’s upcoming residency as the start of a new ongoing program whereby red bay will continue to facilitate coffee producers’ travel to their oakland roasting hq for exposure to the roasting cupping and serving processes that happen here in the us in order for them to experience and voice opinions about their products as they appear at the opposite end of their journey up the supply chain the red bay coffee roastery in oakland photo by red bay coffee “we’ll have them help in the process of developing a profile for the coffee that they grow” said konte who also hopes the farmers will contribute to presentations open to the public and to red bay workers for sharing perspectives on “what it means to be a coffee farmer” “we do a lot academic conversations around that you know with slideshows and ‘this is what the coffee looks like” said konte “we can talk about those things but it’s nothing like the farmer bringing up those things with really interesting anecdotal stories like when they had their entire trucks loaded to the gills and they got held up at gunpoint and their entire years’ work robbed” as for the profitsharing arrangement red bay had hoped to initiate upon opening the container café in oakland it has in the midst of the café’s delays found another route to fruition “that got folded into the broader business” konte said “it was kind of hard to not do that” the plan which will go into effect in the second quarter of  is a simplified version that will set aside  percent of the profits of the company and split it equally amongst all of its workers the split will be commensurate with hours worked but not dependent on the role or position of the worker nor will it be contingent upon performance reviews or anything else just a straightforward cut “i know other folks who are doing similar things and they tie them into job evaluations that was just all too much to maintain” said konte “i didn’t want it to be so subjective” the red bay coffee roastery in oakland photo by red bay coffee the café meanwhile — stymied by a permitting oversight related to the footbyfoot foundation of sorts for parking the converted container mobilehomestyle — should be open anywhere from one to three months from now depending on how negotiations play out “i’ve got a really awesome team of folks here we’re all just working as hard as we can and trying to do what we do and do it really well” said konte undaunted “it’s easy to try to bite off a lot of projects but we’re really doing our best to give each the attention that they deserve” howard bryman howard bryman is the associate editor of daily coffee news by roast magazine he is based in
