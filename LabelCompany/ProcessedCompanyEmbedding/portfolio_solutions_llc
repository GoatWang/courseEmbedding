brumleycontact usclient login you are herehomelatest learningsinvestment rebalancing explained rebalancing explained a portfolio should not be invested in an asset allocation strategy and then forgotten your portfolio must be rebalanced to keep the asset classes aligned with your longterm asset allocation strategy rebalancing can reduce risk invest cash effectively and keep a portfolio on track a disciplined rebalancing program also eliminates subjective and emotional decision making that can throw a portfolio far off an investor’s desired level of risk an ongoing rebalancing program is rigorously applied at portfolio solutions® we review all portfolios continuously and single out client portfolios where asset classes are off the target allocation by a predetermined amount as an example assume a portfolio is being managed to a  percent stock and  percent bond allocation it will be a candidate for rebalancing if the stock or bond portion grows to  percent or falls to  percent  portfolio rebalancing is not automatic although our computer programs isolate client portfolios that need review each review is individually conducted by our highly trained portfolio management staff that makes the ultimate rebalancing decisions there are reasons a portfolio may not be rebalanced at the time it is identified expected cash flows and trading cost minimization play important roles in rebalancing decisions rebalancing will sometimes occur when a contribution of cash andor securities is made to an account or a cash withdrawal is requested by a client it is important for clients to communicate with us when there will be a cash withdrawal from an account so that we may raise the cash in a proper time period many clients are on an automatic withdrawal program and those clients do not need to contact us at each withdrawal period dividend and interest income may also be used for rebalancing this income initially flows into a money market fund where it is either invested where needed or distributed out periodically as part of an automatic withdrawal program our experts at passive low cost investing  portfolio solutions get started search form search
