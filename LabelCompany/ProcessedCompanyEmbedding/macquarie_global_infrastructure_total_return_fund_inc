of its assets in securities or instruments of any single issuer with respect to the  that is not subject to the  limitation the fund does not intend to acquire at the time of investment more than  in any one issuer does the fund apply leverage the fund intends to utilize leverage through the issuance of leverage instruments the fund may not use leverage at all times and the amount of leverage may vary depending upon a number of factors including the investment managers outlook for the market and the costs that the fund would incur as a result of such leverage the fund will not issue leverage instruments with an aggregate issue price exceeding   in the case of debt or  in the case of preferred stock of the funds total assets including the proceeds from the issuance of leverage instruments in each case at the time such leverage instruments are issued following the issuance of leverage instruments however the balance of outstanding leverage instruments may exceed   or  as applicable of the funds total assets due to a reduction in the value of the funds total assets subject to restrictions on leverage imposed by the  act the leverage instruments would have complete priority upon distribution of assets over common shares although the timing and other terms of the offering of leverage instruments and the terms of the leverage instruments would be determined by the board in consultation with the investment advisor the fund expects to invest any proceeds derived from any leverage instrument offering in securities consistent with the funds investment objective and policies

infrastructure click here to read an ‘introduction to infrastructure’ on this website what are the risks investing in the fund involves risks and the fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective for a variety of reasons the following discussion summarizes some of the risks that an investor should consider before deciding whether to invest in the fund for additional information about the risks associated with investing in the fund see additional information about the fund’s investments and investment risk in the prospectus and sai advisor risk mcim is an investment advisor and member of macquarie group macquarie group has experience in the assessment and valuation of infrastructure assets and experience with the operational and regulatory risks faced by infrastructure issuers there can be no assurance that a suitable replacement could be found for macquarie group in the event that its resources become unavailable to mcim the fund is also subject to risk because it is an actively managed portfolio mcim will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results industry concentration and infrastructure industry risk under normal circumstances the fund will seek to invest at least  per cent of its total assets in equity securities and securities and instruments with equity characteristics that are issued by infrastructure issuers given the concentration of the fund’s assets in the infrastructure industry the fund will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry than an investment company that is not concentrated in a single industry infrastructure issuers are typically subject to a variety of factors that my adversely affect their business or operations including high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs costs associated with environmental and other regulations the effects of economic slowdowns and surplus capacity increased competition from other providers of services uncertainties concerning the cost of energy and the effects of energy conservation policies infrastructure issuers may be subject to regulation by various governmental authorities and may also be affected by governmental regulation of rates charged to customers service interruption due to environmental operational or other mishaps the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws regulatory policies and accounting standards nonus investment risk the fund may invest up to  per cent of its total assets in the securities and instruments of nonus issuers investments in the securities and instruments of nonus issuers involve certain considerations and risks not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of us issuers nonus companies are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial standards and requirements comparable to those applicable to us companies nonus securities exchanges brokers and listed companies may be subject to less government supervision and regulation than exists in the united states dividend and interest income may be subject to nonus withholding and other taxes which may adversely affect the net return on such investments emerging market risk the fund may invest in countries that are considered emerging market countries at the time of purchase the fund’s investments in emerging markets are subject to all of the risks described in nonus investments risk and have additional heightened risks due to a lack of established legal political business and social frameworks to support securities markets foreign nonus currency risk the fund’s common shares are priced in us foreign nonus currency risk dollars and the distributions paid by the fund are paid in us dollars however a significant portion of the fund’s assets may be denominated in foreign nonus currencies there is the risk that the value of such assets andor the value of any distributions from such assets may decrease if the currency in which such assets are priced or in which they make distributions falls in relation to the value of the us dollar market disruption and geopolitical risk the aftermath of the war with iraq the continuing occupation of iraq instability in the middle east and terrorist attacks in the united states and around the world have had a substantial impact on the us and world economies and securities markets the nature scope and duration of the war and the occupation cannot be predicted with any certainty these risks could also adversely affect individual issuers and securities markets interest rates secondary trading rating investor psychology credit risk inflation and other factors relating to the common shares and the investments made by the fund new project risk where the fund invests in new infrastructure projects it is likely to retain some residual risk that the project will not be completed within budget within the agreed time frame and to the agreed specification investment and market risk an investment in the fund’s common shares is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire amount invested an investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities and instruments owned by the fund of which a large proportion will be traded on national securities exchanges or in the overthecounter markets the fund’s share price will fluctuate and at the time of sale shares may be worth more or less than the original investment or the fund’s thencurrent net asset value the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at a price at above or below its net asset value equity risk the nav of the fund’s common shares will change as the prices of its portfolio investments go up or down equity securities face market issuer and other risks and their prices may go up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably interest rate risk of preferred hybrid and debt securities interest rate risk includes the risk that debt securities and securities with debtlike characteristics including preferred and hybrid securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates equity securities the income and profits of many of the issuers in which the fund might invest may be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and therefore changes in the level of interest rates may have a direct bearing on the issuers’ ability to pay dividends or make distributions infrastructure assets infrastructure assets can be highly leveraged as such movements in the level of interest rates may affect the returns from these assets more significantly than other assets in some instances debt securities risk the fund may invest up to  per cent of its total assets in debt securities which are subject to interest rate risk see risks—interest rate risk they also carry the risk that the issuer or the guarantor of a security will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or otherwise to honor its obligations this risk is particularly pronounced for lowerquality high yielding debt securities there is no minimum credit rating for the debt securities in which the fund may invest risk of hedging and use of derivatives derivatives can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large impact on the fund’s performance certain of the investment techniques that the fund may employ for hedging or under certain circumstances to increase income or total return will expose the fund to additional risks illiquid and unlisted securities risk under normal market conditions the fund may invest up to  per cent of its total assets in unlisted securities and other instruments of infrastructure issuers such securities and instruments are generally not publicly traded in the united states such securities and instruments are generally unregistered for securities law purposes and can generally be resold only in privately negotiated transactions with a limited number of purchasers or in a public offering registered under the securities act outside the united states similar restrictions may apply leverage risk the fund may utilize leverage through the issuance of leverage instruments in the event the fund utilizes leverage there can be no assurance that the fund’s leverage strategy will be successful leverage involves risks and special considerations for investors including the likelihood of greater volatility of nav and market price of the common shares than a comparable portfolio without leverage the risk that fluctuations in interest rates or dividend rates on leverage instruments issued by the fund will reduce the return to the investors or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on the common shares the effect of leverage in a declining market which is likely to cause a greater decline in the nav of the fund and the market price of the common shares than if the fund were not leveraged when the fund uses leverage instruments the investment advisory fees payable to the advisor will be higher than if the fund did not use leverage dependence on key personnel the fund is dependent upon the expertise of the fund’s portfolio managers if mcim were to lose the services of either portfolio manager the fund would not be adversely affected as the remaining individuals on the funds investment team who serve as portfolio managers for other portfolios that are similar to mgu would replace him temporary defensive strategies risk when the advisor anticipates unusual market or other conditions the fund may temporarily depart from its principal investment strategies as a defensive measure to the extent that the fund invests defensively it likely will not achieve its investment objectives antitakeover provisions the maryland general corporation law and the fund’s charter and bylaws include provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the fund to convert the fund to openend status or to change the composition of the fund’s board of directors these provisions as well as other provisions of maryland law and the fund’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging delaying deferring or
