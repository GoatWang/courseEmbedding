affecting particular companies or the securities market generally a general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously although equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities growth investing risk the risk of investing in growth stocks that may be more volatile than other stocks because they are more sensitive to investor perceptions of the issuing company’s growth potential value investing risk the risk of investing in undervalued stocks that may not realize their perceived value for extended periods of time or may never realize their perceived value  value stocks may respond differently to market and other developments than other types of stocks midcap company risk the risk of investing in securities of midcap companies that could entail greater risks than investments in larger more established companies midcap companies tend to have narrower product lines more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks as compared with larger companies as a result their stock prices may decline significantly as market conditions change foreign investment risk the risk that investing in foreign nonus securities may result in the fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of us companies due to smaller markets differing reporting accounting and auditing standards nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation currency blockages and political changes of diplomatic developments the cost of investing in many foreign markets are higher than the us and investments may be less liquid emerging markets risk the risk of investing in securities of companies located in emerging markets countries which primarily includes increased foreign investments risk emerging markets countries may have unstable governments andor economies that are subject to sudden change and may also lack the legal business and social framework to support securities markets which tends to make investments less liquid and more volatile credit risk the risk that the fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security or the counterparty of a derivatives contract or repurchase agreement is unable or unwilling or is perceived to be unable or unwilling to make a timely payment of principal andor interest or to otherwise honor its obligations interest rate risk the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration derivatives risk the risk that an investment in derivatives may not correlate completely to the performance of underlying securities and may be volatile and may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested equity derivatives may also be subject to liquidity risk as well as the risk the derivative may be different than what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations
