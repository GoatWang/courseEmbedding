montana lessons to be learned from tanya chemodurow of abatement contractors of montana after eight years tanya chemodurow finally has a place to hang her kimono    sitting in tanya’s very modern office at abatement contractors of montana llc with a kimono hanging on the wall it’s hard to believe she started in an old  square foot apartment building in east missoula  touring her new  square foot facility tanya’s passion and devotion for the business she has developed from the ground up is evident    chemodurow is an sba allstar   she’s received an sba  loan through montana community finance corporation became a certified for federal contracting and graduated from sba’s e emerging leaders program    “all really go handinhand” said chemodurow     she learned about the a program while attending a ptac procurement technical assistance center conference  sba’s a business development program is a nineyear program established to assist eligible socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to develop and grow their business through federal contracting although the program does not specifically treat women as social and economically disadvantaged chemodurow was able to prove with evidence that she was in fact disadvantaged  sba defines socially disadvantaged individuals as those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual capabilities   “it wasn’t easy” chemodurow said  after two years and four denials sba finally approved chemodurow’s application and certified abatement contractors of montana llc as a  chemodurow is currently in her fifth year of the nineyear program and has been awarded over  contracts for more than  million dollars with her a status    as an a company chemodurow was invited to participate in sba’s inaugural e emerging leaders program in   she almost didn’t signup as it was a sevenmonth hour commitment traveling to helena every other week but she felt like it was important to learn more to fill in her weak spots and become more comfortable with her business financials     she said she is glad she didn’t turn down the opportunity to gain so much knowledge and make new contacts  during the e emerging leaders program one of the segments was on financing and linda kindrick of montana community finance corporation was a guest panelist  that’s where chemodurow learned about sba’s  loan program and began wondering if that loan product would work for her business and her growth plan  after graduating from the e class chemodurow approached kindrick and began the process of obtaining a  loan for her new facility  the threeyear strategic growth plan that she put together during the e program was instrumental in helping her obtain the loan    chemodurow credits her success to her commitment to taking advantage of every available opportunity and to always making time and a concerted effort to learn more    “i’ve been in the right place at the right time many times and it’s not by accident” chemodurow said   as for her future plans chemodurow said she will continue to learn and continue to grow  “i’ve learned a lot by trial and error and i’ve learned that if i don’t try i’m not only going to not get anything but i’m also not going to learn” montana district office home about
