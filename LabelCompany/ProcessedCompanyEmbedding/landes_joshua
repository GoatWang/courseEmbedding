levant the reassertion of assad’s control over much of syria underlines the success of iran’s policy in the northern middle east western efforts to overturn assad and bring to power a sunni ascendency in syria have failed as have efforts to flip syria out of russia’s and iran’s orbit and into that of the united states and saudi arabia the cut off of cia funding for syria’s rebels is the raggedy ending of america’s failed regimechange policy in syria and the region at large president trump called the wars in the middle east “stupid wars” during his campaign he called america’s policy of regimechange a “failed policy” this is his effort to concentrate narrowly on eliminating isis and ending washington’s effort to drive assad from power by force of arms he believes that by working with the russians the united states will destroy isis more quickly it should be added that syria’s military with russian backing has killed hundreds of isis fighters in the last several months it has driven isis from territory twice the size of lebanon in the last two months alone further efforts to weaken or destroy the syrian army will only slow isis’s demise this decision by the security establishment has been a long time coming as it became clear that assad would not fall or step aside particularly after russia jumped into the conflict in sept 0 the arming of rebels to overthrow assad became a vestigial policy president macron articulated this position for the eu when he declared that it was unrealistic to believe that assad would go support for arming rebels has been waning since radicals began setting off bombs in european capitals trump’s decision to stop support for syrian rebels will be the final nail in the coffin of those factions which draw salaries from the cia

iran russia us resolving article 0 settling the issue of iraq’s disputed territories ahead of an independence referendum for kurdistan posted by matthew barber on thursday july th 0 this article was published july  0 by nrt a media service in iraqi kurdistan the original article is available here photos and images have been added to this repost that were not present in the original   a new billboard in erbil with masoud barzani’s image reading “yes—for kurdish independence and statehood”   by megan connelly and matthew barber contested lands last month talks led by the kurdistan democratic party kdp at the presidential residence seri resh in the kurdistan region of iraq kri led to a decision to hold a referendum this september on kurdistani independence though the obvious assumption would be that only residents of the area seeking independence ie the kurdistan region would be able to vote on a decision to secede from iraq this referendum is being presented as a vote in which residents of iraq’s disputed territories will also participate the disputed territories are areas in iraq over which both the iraqi federal government ifg–based in baghdad and the kurdistan regional government krg–based in erbil claim administrative rights currently the kurdistan region is an autonomous jurisdictional entity that is part of a federal iraq but which has its own government armed forces immigration laws administrative bureaucracies and so forth prior to any discussion of potential independence for the kurdistan region it should be understood that the disputed territories are parts of the nineveh salah addin kirkuk and diyala governorates over which the respective governments of baghdad and erbil have been locked in conflict since the fall of saddam hussein even if the kri was to not seek independence the status of each disputed territory as a domain of the federal government or the regional government must be resolved kurdistani independence therefore involves more than the question of whether the inhabitants of the kri desire independence it also requires determining which disputed territories all of which are outside of the official boundaries of the kri would be included in the kri and ultimately within the new independent state for years the disputed territories have been exploited for their deposits of oil and natural gas but have often been neglected amid a state of political and administrative limbo between baghdad and erbil many disputed territories have been under kurdish military or administrative control following the us invasion of iraq even though services and infrastructure in many of these territories continue to be funded through the ifg budget now as kurdish security forces hashd alsha’bi and other ethnosectarian militias seek to consolidate their territorial gains with the liberation of the remaining islamic state is enclaves in the disputed territories it is urgent the ifg and the krg establish clear jurisdictional boundaries by peaceful means—to not do so could spell their eventual delineation in battle therefore erbil and baghdad must revisit article 0 the transitional provision of the iraqi constitution that mandates the normalization census and referendum processes that must occur to determine the future status of each disputed territory individually this will resolve whether the territories will become part of the kri or will remain within the ifg’s system of governorates why the referendum does not provide a solution for the disputed territories acting krg president barzani has declared that the referendum will be a solution to the ongoing article 0 dispute but according to hemin hawrami senior advisor to the acting president the sole question that will be posed to voters in the referendum is “do you want an independent kurdistan” no one disputes the fact that the vast majority of kurds desire independence one kurdish researcher framed this observation as follows “kurdistan does not need a referendum because the history and geography and  years of struggle have answered this question for the whole world” the referendum’s question therefore would seem almost superfluous for the kri but while the referendum’s proposed question may nevertheless be appropriate to direct at residents of the kri it is a premature question for inhabitants of the disputed territories whether or not voters want independence is not a relevant inquiry as regards the complex geographic demographic and political realities in the disputed territories where the question that should be posed is “do you want your district to become a part of the kurdistan region” the idea that populations living outside of the kurdistan region could participate alongside residents of the kri in a vote that would establish a basis for the statehood of a region whose future borders are not yet determined is simply confusing for kurds iraqis and outside observers alike it is clear that at least two questions—not one—must be answered by separate groups of iraqis manipulating patriotism the phrasing of the referendum’s question is indicative of ethnic outbidding by asking voters if they “want independence” as opposed to inquiring for example as to whether voters approve of a parliamentary motion to declare independence the kdp is playing a semantics game designed to force voters to deliver a “patriotic” or “unpatriotic” response a tactic to rally broad nationalist support behind the kdp’s drive for political dominance while discrediting the domestic opposition by casting doubt on their supporters’ kurdayeti beyond the realm of mere words kurdish authorities have already begun arresting dissenters and shutting down media centers that publish literature that “uses inappropriate language in connection with the referendum” as well as harassing and assaulting journalists and writers who have expressed opposition to the referendum to garner support for the vote the kurdish nationalist parties—and the kdp in particular—have been aggressively fueling  kurdish irredentist sentiments and issuing provocative statements such as krg pm nechirvan barzani’s affirmation that the “disputed territories are no longer disputed” the acting president’s assertion that opposition to the referendum would be met with a “bloody war” and a kdp mp’s call for the legal prosecution and punishment of the political opposition to the vote moreover the kdp has linked issue of kurdish statehood with that of masoud barzani’s continued leadership and his defiance of parliament’s attempts to limit presidential power  the alarming tone of this discourse rose to a crescendo this week when barzani before the european parliament accused opposition mps of concocting an “attempted coupt d’etat” against him in parliament prior to its dissolution by the kdp and of being responsible for the deaths of children in the 0 riots in the sulaimaniyah governorate furthermore the language of the referendum announcement itself does not acknowledge that disputed territories are “disputed” instead referring to them as “kurdish areas outside of the krg’s administrative area” this language does not recognize the presence of the very populations whose existence is the origin of the disputed territory dilemma arabs assyrian and chaldean christians turkoman certain yazidis who do not identify as kurds and others in addition to validating aggression against kurdish domestic opposition this kind of antagonistic nationalist campaign will do nothing to assuage the fears and mistrust of minorities and nonkurdish populations with competing claims to selfdetermination in the disputed areas this could ultimately provoke violent reactions with armed sectarian and partisan militias with their various regional sponsors poised to intervene ahead of referendum yazidis targeted for supporting baghdad in the last few years observers have become increasingly familiar with how intimidation is employed to pressure minority populations of the disputed territories into political submission recent punitive measures against yazidis who favor ifg rather than krg administration for shingal sinjar in arabic are a characteristic—and unsurprising—case in point a new human rights watch report has this week exposed a tactic that the kdp asaish are using to deter yazidis from aligning with baghdad expelling displaced yazidi families from the idp camps in dohuk and evicting them from the kri if a family member joins the baghdadsupported hashd alsha’bi forces in shingal this tactic is unsurprising as the kdp asaish already expelled from the same camps in 00 displaced yazidi families if a family member joined the pkkaffiliated ybş a local yazidi force in shingal that challenges kdp hegemony the yazidis of shingal are a perfect example of the challenge of iraq’s disputed territories this population has long stymied kdp attempts to smoothly incorporate shingal into the kri yazidis are independentlyminded have repeatedly been victimized by external parties vying for control of their areas and as a result are mixed as to whether they even identify as kurds unlike yazidis from villages inside the kri many yazidis from shingal resolutely identify only as “yazidi” maintaining that it is not only their religious affiliation but also their ethnic identity the vast majority resent kurdish politics and would prefer a quiet form of local governance this hasn’t stopped the kdp from insisting that shingal’s population wants to be included in the kri and they always have an array of token yazidi mouthpieces ready to authenticate this claim the displacement of the majority of shingal’s yazidi population to the kri during the yazidi genocide stirred fears among much of the community that they could be subjected to attempts to be resettled in the kri rather than helped to return to shingal and rebuild their lives a kdpenforced economic blockade of shingal implemented all of 0 and early 0 deliberately slowed the returns of yazidi idps to shingal one motivation for this measure appears to have been to try to starve the ybş of resources and prevent a larger civilian support base for the ybş from growing in shingal despite this measure to inhibit civilian returns the kdp did not hesitate to evict families from the camps and return them to shingal when their family members joined the ybş though many families wanted to return and rebuild in areas that had been freed from is other families were not yet ready to do so and this punitive measure placed pressure on families to beg their young people to not join those forces for about two years the kdp has branded the pkk affiliates as “foreign” entities not acknowledging that their rank and file are comprised of local shingali yazidis the “foreign” argument is even less applicable to the hashd alsha’bi yazidis are effectively being criminalized for the choice to work with their own federal government nevertheless the asaish’s current expulsions follow the same pattern as the earlier ybş evictions though yazidi families ultimately hope to return to a secure shingal many are not ready to leave the camps—for economic reasons as well as out of concern regarding the now threeway political standoff in shingal targeting vulnerable families with forced evictions is therefore a powerful political deterrent shingal is now divided by three political competitors each having its own yazidi militias on the ground kdpaffiliated peshmerga pkkaffiliated ybş and the baghdadaffiliated hashd alsha’bi two out of these three factions with their associated civilian supporters obviously do not favor inclusion into a kdpdominated kri most of shingal’s yazidis therefore do not oppose kurdistani independence but simply view it as none of their concern since they hope to administer shingal locally and separately from the kri this should adequately illustrate how a singlequestion referendum on kurdistani independence is entirely incapable of resolving disputed territory issues practical problems with holding the referendum in disputed territories the proposed date of september  0 for the referendum initially gave the krg less than four months to raise and allocate money resources and personnel to ensure that residents of the disputed territories would be represented facilitating the participation of people from the disputed territories will be extremely difficult and quite costly due to high rates of internal displacement so far only  million have been earmarked for the referendum and the krg can expect no financial support from its neighbors and international supporters virtually all of whom have come out against the referendum even turkey one of the closest allies of the kdp has spoken out strongly against the referendum additionally none of the krg’s international partners or the united nations have thus far expressed a willingness to monitor the referendum in fact the united nations recently issued a statement emphasizing that it “has no intention to be engaged in any way or form” in monitoring the independence referendum due to its commitments to the territorial integrity of iraq therefore aside from repeated assurances from erbil that the process will be fair to ethnoreligious minorities in the disputed territories the kri has not announced any plan to accommodate them or hold separate referenda on their preferences rudaw has recently reported that as of yet no preparations have been made for the referendum in kirkuk the most populated of all disputed territories typically funding for elections would come from the independent high electoral commission of iraq ihec but the commission’s kirkuk office has denied that it has a budget or a plan for the referendum since the referendum was initiated unilaterally not through mutual discussion with baghdad the krg cannot expect to receive support for the referendum from the ifg the president of the kirkuk provincial council rebwar talabani has proposed that kirkuk prepare on its own for the referendum without relying on funding from the ihec but with just another two and a half months to prepare there has been no consensus in the provincial council on how the referendum should be funded or even regarding the legality of holding the referendum in the province holding the vote for the people of shingal could be even more difficult shingal’s yazidis are now divided among the many thousands in the idp camps of dohuk thousands more in idp camps in syria and turkey tens of thousands of recent migrants to europe most of whom would prefer to return to a secure shingal others who have migrated to canada the us and australia idps in camps on shingal mountain administered by pkkaffiliated institutions returnees to damageddestroyed areas in kdpadministered areas north of shingal returnees to yazidi villages south of shingal now under the control of hashd alsha’bi what is the krg’s plan to make sure that all of these people are able to freely and fairly vote in the referendum mahama khalil unelected mayor of shingal sinjar—photo kirkuk now in a recent interview with kirkuk now mahama khalil appointed by the kdp to act as unelected mayor of the shingal district also said that no preparations had been made to conduct the vote in shingal in the interview he also exhibits a certain confusion as to the proper legal channels through which to conduct the vote and stated defiantly that the pkk and hashd alsha’bi will not be able to disrupt the freedom of yazidis to vote in the referendum but the real question should be what will guarantee that the kdp does not apply pressure on the voters if the krg intends to facilitate the shingali people’s free democratic decision as to the future of their district things are off to a bad start with their asaish already punishing and intimidating those who express a desire to see shingal remain under baghdad’s administration opposition to the referendum within the kri beyond the anticipated debacle of trying to hold the referendum in the disputed territories the kurdish mainland may also temper the success of the referendum though the vast majority of kurds support the principle of kurdish independence there is significant anxiety among many in the kri as to whether this referendum is being pursued in the right way and for the right reasons contrary to assertions that this referendum has the backing of a broad political coalition this has not been the case the june  meeting at seri resh that resulted in the decision to hold the referendum did not include gorran or the kurdistan islamic group the gorranled political opposition regards the referendum as a vote on the legitimacy of the kdp’s monopolization of power masoud barzani’s unilaterallyextended presidency and the abandonment of parliamentary democracy their sense is that the referendum would effectively make the kdp the vanguard of the nationalist movement and discredit the opposition which insists upon institutionbuilding or at least having working democratic institutions prior to statehood together gorran and the kurdistan islamic group constitute  of parliament the kurdistan islamic union has also announced its refusal to back the vote without parliamentary approval billboards and signs associating barzani’s presidency with independence now appear everywhere in erbil it is also unclear the degree to which the puk supports the referendum despite the participation of puk leadership council members in the seri resh conference on june th the issue of holding an independence referendum has divided the puk in general the puk supports the reactivation of parliament prior to holding an independence referendum however while some have backed the kdp’s proposal to reactivate the legislature with the current speaker dr yusuf muhammad for one session thirtyfour out of fiftyfive puk leadership council members  support not just reactivation but “normalization”—ie gorran’s argument that parliament must be reactivated and remain active until the next parliamentary elections with dr yusuf as speaker—and oppose the nomination of a puk delegate to the referendum committee prior to parliament’s reactivation krg viceprime minister qubad talabani and kirkuk governor najmaddin karim’s attendance—in defiance of the wishes of the majority of the leadership council—at the referendum committee hearings and at the krg’s delegation to the european parliament this week to garner support for the referendum prompted outrage within the puk politburo mahmoud sangawi a member of the leadership council and general commander of the germian region lashed out at talabani and karim “they are not representatives of the puk they represent only themselves” is the referendum actually binding while acting president masoud barzani has promised that the referendum on independence would be “binding”  barzani and others including kdp executive and former iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari have qualified this by saying that independence will not be declared immediately after the vote but rather that the vote would give the krg a mandate to open independence negotiations with baghdad in fact it is doubtful that the kri would benefit politically or financially from declaring independence with a budget shortfall of over  billion the kri has had extreme difficulty paying public salaries and pensions providing services and maintaining infrastructure in its administrative areas a declaration of independence would mean that the kri would not only be responsible for providing salaries to kri employees but also for public servants that are currently paid by the ifg as well as providing utilities water and other services to the disputed territories the kri’s ministry of natural resources along with the provinces of kirkuk nineveh and salah addin also have productionsharing agreements psas with the ifg to extract and market kirkuk crude that provide for significant infrastructure development in the disputed territories the salaries of kri civil servants and healthy dividends for kdp and puklinked production and marketing firms and the kdpled ministry of natural resources moreover the announcement on the referendum came less than two weeks after the krg central bank announced that it agreed to be taken over by the iraqi central bank and the iraqi oil ministry announced plans to finance the construction of a new oil refinery in kirkuk to the tune of  billion with all of the above in mind it seems that participating parties in the referendum committee are more interested in gaining leverage against the ifg and their domestic political rivals and in maximizing the political and financial gains of the kri’s two dominant parties the kdp and puk whether the krg actually intends to declare independence or not the referendum campaign itself could nevertheless stir violent tensions among the various populations and political factions contending for the disputed territories the referendum’s lack of planning preparation legal definition or multilateral participation sets a dangerous precedent and may also be perceived as anticlimactic by many kurds who have long struggled for independence the solution to ensure the stability and security of iraq and kurdistan both the federal and regional governments must revisit article 0 and make a concerted effort to determine once and for all the status of the disputed territories of course implementation will be even more difficult now than it was twelve years ago mainly because demographic normalization which must precede the execution of a census and referendum has been disturbed by population displacements in the wake of the is invasion with so much at stake and so many competing territorial claims to evaluate and negotiate it will be extremely difficult for two governments that doubt each other’s good faith to commit to this long and arduous process yet continuing to avoid the article 0 process as the pressure continues to build on all sides will yield severe consequences for both governments as well as for their international allies most analysts agree that the international community particularly the united nations and the united states must step up its involvement in order to help stabilize iraq’s postis landscape and adopt a framework to address the challenges posed by the jurisdictional conflicts in the disputed territories currently the united nations assistance mission to iraq unami’s mandate is limited to humanitarian and diplomatic assistance at the request of the government of iraq furthermore the mandate’s scope is overlybroad expressing the un’s intention to promote economic and institutional development throughout iraq but without any clear focus on addressing the territorial disputes between the krg and the ifg therefore the un will need a mandate specifically tailored to the mediation of the article 0 process that will provide for the necessary resources for resolving territorial and property disputes and completing the normalization or dearabization process conducting censuses and referenda more than simply revisiting article 0 the mandate must also address the effects of civil war population displacements and genocide that have occurred since the passage of the iraqi constitution it will be necessary to secure krg and ifg cooperation to reconstruct and provide adequate services to recently liberated cities like shingal and jalawla it should also bring community leaders regional and federal officials together to respond to the requests of small territorially concentrated ethnic minorities for local administrative autonomy finally but most importantly the mandate should include the deployment of armed peacekeepers to prevent the eruption of clashes that could sabotage progress on the diplomatic and humanitarian end indeed research has shown that multifaceted missions those that include diplomatic humanitarian and security provisions are more likely to have successful longterm outcomes than missions with a purely humanitarian or security focus although such a mission will depend on the krg’s withdrawal of the present referendum proposal independence for the kri should not be off the table iraqi pm haider alabadi has even conceded that the kurds have a right to selfdetermination up to and including their own state however if the kurdish parties truly intend to secede from iraq the un and iraq’s international partners should condition their support for the independence process on the krg’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of territorial energy and water disputes with the ifg as well as its observance of the region’s own laws and the authority of its own legally established regional decisionmaking bodies for example the un should require that the krg reactivate its parliament hold legislative and presidential elections and encourage the passage of a motion in parliament authorizing the formation of a high committee to plan an independence referendum before it agrees to monitor the vote likewise by obtaining guarantees from the international community to support a future independence referendum that is conducted in accordance with the above conditions barzani could save face domestically while withdrawing the current referendum although un peacekeeping missions do not have a stellar success rate this can be partly attributed to the difficulty of the missions that the un accepts the lack of willingness on the part of host nations to give the un the flexibility it needs to succeed and a lack of cooperation from regional and international partners while resolving territorial disputes will invariably be a grueling process a mission to carry out article 0 can still succeed if domestic regional and international partners are committed to it of course a un peacekeeping mission would be a bitter pill to swallow for both baghdad and erbil it will be costly it will require a longterm commitment and parties will have to accept compromises that they may perceive as suboptimal ultimately the value of peace for both sides will outweigh the value of the benefits that either side would expect to gain from continuing down the current path which will inevitably lead to armed conflict whether by design or miscalculation the diplomatic efforts of iraq’s neighbors and international partners particularly the us will be crucial in raising the ifg and kri’s perceived costs of noncompliance such as threatening a withdrawal of military or financial support from the krg andor ifg and reducing their perceived costs of compromise by offering incentives for both to accept un conditions additionally us influence will be necessary to secure the resolution from the security council to authorize a multifaceted peacekeeping mission in the disputed territories conversely the un must obtain guarantees of cooperation from the potential regional spoilers iran and turkey as well as the united states this will also require mutual assurances and recognition that a peaceful resolution of the article 0 disputes is the optimal outcome and that all parties will commit their resources to that end however with the iranianbacked hashd al sha’bi making gains along the syrian border and the mobilization of turkish armed forces in the kri as well as turkish air strikes against pkk and ybş positions in shingal regional actors appear to be on a war footing in iraq so is the us with a weakened department of state a newlyempowered pentagon and an ambassador to the un who recently bragged about cutting the peacekeeping budget by over half a

trump’s iran claims not just flawed but dangerous – by steven simon posted by joshua on wednesday july th 0 rollback trump’s iran claims not just flawed but dangerous steven simon argues that trump’s view on iran is not only analytically flawed but also dangerous july  0 previously published on iiss blog by steven simon john j mccloy ’ visiting professor of history at amherst college and contributing editor to survival the trump administration for all its disarray has a clear and consistent policy toward the middle east in other theatres administration policy seems to lack organising principles – in europe for example where the united states’ commitment to nato has been both derided and valourised and in asia where china is a threat one minute and an ally the next washington’s approach to the middle east by contrast is distinguished by its clarity the organising principle is that iran is the root of all evil there is no doubt that iran is the root of some evil but mr trump’s totalising claim and the exculpation of other regional states’ role in the current instability is not just analytically flawed but dangerous leading ineluctably to hazardous policy objectives during the cold war american hardliners demanded ‘rollback’ of soviet power from eastern europe they viewed containment the prevailing strategy toward the soviet union as strategically and morally obtuse the problem with rollback however was that the soviet union had an asymmetrically greater interest in holding on to eastern europe these states were the mostly flat plain through which germany had funneled an army that killed millions moscow was not going to surrender this vital bufer easily a us effort to wrest eastern europe from soviet rule might therefore escalate uncontrollably rollback never really gained traction until the soviets under mikhail gorbachev’s leadership came to trust west germany enough to be relatively relaxed about dissolving the warsaw pact after trump’s visit to saudi arabia and renewed focus on iran it is hard not to think of the cold war rollback debate even the language of neorollback advocates recalls the apocalyptic wars of the twentieth century iran they contend wants land corridors to the west to strengthen hizbullah and launch a second front against israel while keeping the assad regime alive strengthening hizbullah and using it to harass israel have long been iranian goals but in the trumpian rhetoric they have been transformed into a sinister plan for regional dominion phrases such as ‘land corridors’ mimic the geopolitical language of the interwar period implying an equivalence between the fascist threat to european security in the twentieth century and the shia threat to middle eastern security in the twentyfirst how much of this just bubbles up from the subconscious and how much is sly reference is hard to say but the effect is to convey urgency and existential danger in reality the iranian behaviour that has catalysed talk of rollback has not changed since the 0s when israel’s assault on palestinian militants in lebanon spurred shia resentment and ambition opening the door to iran fighting between syria and israel forged a convergence of interest between damascus and tehran it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship and that was  years ago before many advocates of iran rollback were born israel rightly points to hizbullah’s inventory of iranian missiles as a serious threat these stockpiles however were created without a land corridor weapons were flown into damascus and trucked into lebanon the possibility of a land corridor exists only because saddam hussein’s regime in iraq – the sturdiest possible barrier between iran and the levant – was toppled in  neither israel nor the us has devised a way to sever the umbilical link between hizbullah and iran or to split syria from iran there was hope in early 0 when bashar alassad supposedly agreed to abandon iran in return for the golan heights this was allegedly curtailed first by israel’s disinterest then by war in syria iran’s costly defence of syria since then has been consistent with their deep reciprocal reliance the us has run hot and cold on iran ever since the islamic revolution the cia was still passing intelligence to iran in late  a wish for rapprochement led the us to sell weapons to iran in the 0s that turned into a failed armsforhostages deal and a renewed tough line toward tehran yet even after iranbacked suicide bombers killed us marines in beirut and iranian mines blasted a us warship and other vessels under us protection the reagan administration declined to escalate militarily george hw bush subordinated us hostility towards iran to the war against saddam in  the clinton administration anathematised both iran and iraq although iran was complicit in the  khobar bombing mohammad khatami’s election as president produced a thaw the us never retaliated after  the us and iran cooperated in afghanistan followed by another swing against iran as part of an ‘axis of evil’ the obama administration embraced toughened multilateral sanctions cyber war and sabotage but entered into successful diplomacy after the election of hassan rouhani given this cyclical pattern renewed assertiveness and anxiety is no surprise the nuclear deal with iran partly explains the current push for rollback israel and the gulf states have pocketed the deal’s ten years without a nucleararmed iran in their neighbourhood moving the goalposts to what they see as the linked threat of iranian regional aggression weapons transfers to houthi rebels in yemen support for a seriously wounded syrian ally influence in baghdad and a close relationship with lebanese hizbullah it is a remarkable imaginative leap to believe that these concerns however nettlesome outweigh the threat of a nuclear iran but this calculus does appear to drive saudi emirati and israeli policy the locus of the iranian challenge is an area in southern syria where the borders of jordan iraq and syria meet two towns constitute the flashpoint altanaf and al bu kamal straddling the baghdad–damascus highway this trade route has been closed for a long time whether it will reopen under us control or under the assad regime is uncertain american forces are increasing there rather than in the areas where the islamic state is strongest new powerful artillery systems have been deployed and the us has been firing on iranianled proassad militias extending their tentacles toward altanaf and al bu kamal a longterm us presence in a bleak desert surrounded by hostile tribes for the purpose of blocking iran’s quest for a land corridor is now being contemplated for the administration this is where rollback begins but as in the cold war

posted by aron lund on thursday june nd 0 by aron lund half a year after expelling the city’s antiregime rebels the syrian government continues to face problems in aleppo though civilians have trickled back to the eastern neighborhoods – there’s now more people living there than under rebel rule – reconstruction of the bombedout areas has been sluggish at best and though assad’s control is no longer in dispute question marks remain about basic stability in particular citizens of all political stripes have complained about the lawless behavior of some of the many progovernment  militias that are active in the city while most of assad’s armed forces have moved on to man the temporarily frozen frontlines against turkeybacked rebels in idleb and fight the islamic state near raqqa aleppo is still home to a large number of local militias and socalled popular committees some of these groups have become infamous for plundering shops and homes in the former opposition areas extorting traders at checkpoints and abusing civilians who object to their behavior though these groups are hated by the opposition and often deeply unpopular with government loyalists too they are often protected by highranking contacts in the intelligence services the government continues to rely on their services and in many cases officials profit from their criminality therefore despite growing popular resentment the authorities in aleppo have mostly turned a blind eye to their behavior sporadic police clampdowns and attempts by the aleppo security committee of lt gen zaid alsaleh to enforce rules on checkpoints and smugglers have been stopgap measures at best in early june aleppo witnessed a string of particularly brutal and meaningless militia crimes including the accidental killing of a respected syrianarmenian dentist and the senseless murder of a thirteenyear old boy ahmed jawish the murder was widely reported and condemned across syrian media including by stalwart government loyalists and it seems to have catalyzed a change in the central government’s attitude bashar alassad has now sent one of his top intelligence officials to alepp state security director lt gen mohammed dib zeitoun he has been tasked by the presidential palace with overseeing a crackdown on organized crime and reining in the militias and local authorities – including lt gen saleh’s security commitee the provincial police chief lt gen essam alshelli and the local baath party branch of fadel alnajjar – are now busily reorganizing the security sector the success or failure of dib zeitoun’s crackdown could tell us a lot about the baathist government’s ability to stabilize and restore normal governance to areas of syria where the rebels have held sway – and you can be certain that both

geoffrey aronson for syria comment – june 0 0   abe soliman jeff aronson in middle and alon liel at the bnot yaacov baily bridge over the jordan river “hey it’s akiva who was the old guy with you” the “old guy” was ibrahim “abe” soliman  he and i had just finished a meeting with ron prosor director general of israel’s foreign ministry in a nondescript tel aviv café the two of us were exiting to the street when akiva eldar senior correspondent for ha’aretz just happened to drive by “oh he’s just a friend “ i replied “no one you would know” abe was in israel during a secret visit in april  part of our quiet dialogue in support of an israelisyrian rapprochement together with alon liel a former ambassador and top foreign ministry official we toured the golan plateau and walked across the bailey bridge across the jordan river north of the sea of galilee heights  abe met with the widow of eli cohen and his daughter to discuss the prospect of repatriating her husband’s remains it’s impossible to keep a secret in israel the fact that we were able to keep abe’s visit out of the press was a testament to the seriousness with which our efforts were viewed … and no small amount of luck eli cohen’s daughter and widow with abe soliman and jeff aronson some months later we were able to agree upon a “nonpaper” outlining the creation of a “park” in the golan heights link to the carnegie document the understanding drafted with liel and uri saguy remains the only example of a successful  “track one and one half” engagement between israelis and syrians eldar’s chance drive by threatened to blow up our threeyear effort in midcourse abe died late last month of complications following a stroke i last saw him only a few days before the debilitating attack we were making laborious efforts to reconcile opposing combatants in syria — efforts that after many frustrating months had begun to show a hint of promise  at our last meeting as syria’s descent into selfdestruction continued abe continued to see an opportunity to revive discussions between israel and syria on the golan’s future abe soliman was all but unknown to the lay public but he has been a familiar figure to diplomats on three continents who have toiled in the barren vineyard of israelsyrian diplomacy for almost three decades beginning with his successful effort to win syrian approval for the emigration of syrian jews in the early 0s soliman worked to improve damascus’ and the assad regime’s relations with washington and as the assad’s road to the white house often passed through jerusalem this meant that soliman dedicated time and resources in the last decades to solving the crisis in relations between israel and syria abe’s particular role his effectiveness and its limits is a reflection of the idiosyncratic exercise of power and authority during the assad era young alawi and dirt poor abe was befriended by hafez al assad who had served under the command of abe’s older brother abe tells this evocative story in his selfpublished memoir “my grandfather’s tree a syrian immigrant’s american adventures friendship with dictators and quest for peace in the middle east” abe emigrated from syria to the united states in the late 0s after establishing himself as a us citizen – a lifechanging consequence of a chance friendship with a usfso whom he met as a young boy  — abe maintained business ties with his ancestral homeland and continued his close familial relationship with the ruling family and its inner circle syria is a small country steeped in relationships tied to family geography and religion abe was a good businessman and he provided valuable training to woefully illequipped members of a new and growing syrian governing and administrative class but the real source of his entre was a relationship of trust forged with the assads rooted in a shared history that transcended politics or business and a deeply ingrained belief that quiet understandings reached between men of influence were the key to diplomatic progress abe was intimate with the regime and its shadowy leadership  but he was not of the regime throughout the years he was determined to maintain his independence including financial independence from damascus and even to risk its displeasure he understood better than his friends in damascus that he was more valuable to them and an abler and more effective interlocutor if he stayed outside the wide circle of those who owed everything to the regime the gutters of middle east diplomacy are littered with poseurs and braggarts of all stripes claiming usually without foundation privileged access to those in power abe in contrast was the real deal more than one government in the region was satisfied that abe did indeed have entre to assad’s inner circle if only because they could see the star treatment he received upon arrival in damascus and meetings he arranged for others with the president or his top staff  over the years a parade of us officials made their way to abe’s modest home outside washington to sit with senior syrians around his dining room table if on the one hand abe stood apart from the regime he well understood that his value to interlocutors from ankara to jerusalem and washington was as an authoritative link to the government and its interests he was also well aware that his value to the assads lay in his ability to articulate their views — not his own  — discreetly and secretly in such a way as to elicit something of value that could maintain or excite interest in damascus then as now the regime operated in the dark the leadership is most at home with the curtains drawn jockeying for influence among the shadows transparency is to be avoided at all costs public efforts are all but useless for transacting serious business this is how power and influence are exercised in syria abe was a product of this system and a wily able practitioner who exploited its advantages and was hobbled by its shortcomings secrecy was the signa qua non of any effective diplomatic engagement he was extremely sensitive to the fact that a misstep on his part would not easily be repaired or forgiven by a regime intolerant of any such attempt undertaken by design or in error this proved to be the case when abe arrived in israel for a second this time public visit in april  when he testified before the israeli knesset and made an emotional visit to yad vashem it could not be easy to manage these apparent contradictions — to represent the interests and views of the regime to outsiders while retaining his distance from it and to maintain his personal independence and ability not just to represent but also to influence the policies of hafez the father and after his death in april 0 bashar the son there was also the challenge of maintaining control over the various negotiating tracks that developed during the course of his encounters  during our efforts from  for example meetings in zurich sponsored by the government of switzerland were only one facet of a multidimensional array of bilateral engagements –like the one with prosor– some of which at times appeared to be more important to abe — that is damascus –than the track one and one half dialogue with his israeli counterparts that was nominally the heart of our efforts  like the spider at the center of the web abe endeavored to make sure that he was the only player with the full picture i would bemoan this complexity but for abe it was a natural and necessary state of affairs abe was a son of syria  he was only too familiar with the manner in which power and influence were maintained and exercised in damascus  outsiders could never hope to obtain the keys to this particular castle and abe was continually critical of the uncanny ability of americans and others to misread the opportunities for progress he had few kind words for the syrian opposition especially its expatriate leadership and many reciprocated his antipathy but just as he could call upon his lifelong ties to the assads he remained a respected figure among some opposition figures whom he had known over a lifetime and their children some of whose education he had sponsored at american universities not that he spared the regime particularly in these latter years abe lamented assad’s missteps and repression he despaired for syria’s independence from iranian and less so russian designs and he worried that in syria washington would fall into the trap first opened in afghanistan when it succeeded russia in a war that has yet to end end for jeff aronson’s

europe and the middle east – by sam farah posted by joshua on friday june th 0 nationalism between europe and the middle east by sam farah for syria comment – june  0 steven bannon the man behind the nationalist policy in the trump administration is quoted as saying “i think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors and that is really the building blocks that built western europe and the united states and i think it’s what can see us forward” it is true that nationalism was born in europe and is the foundation of the new modern state however what bannon’s remarks miss is the fact that strong nationalist movements in europe helped lead to the outbreak of world war i and world war ii it has also contributed to a great deal of strife and death in the middle east before the late th century there were no real nation states neither passports nor borders as we know them existed people had ethnic and cultural identities but these did not really define the political entities in which they lived in  almost nobody in france thought of themselves as french at the time of the french revolution in  half its residents did not speak french nationalism did not develop among the general population it was a construct first developed among the intellectual elites of europe johann gottfried herder a german philosopher who believed that language determined national thought and culture first coined the term “nationalism” nationalists expected patriots to then learn their nation’s language and raise their children speaking that language as part of a general program to establish a unique national identity poets and philosophers created folk epics and fairy tales these epic legends and constructed narratives created imagined communities that gave rise to a sense of delusional inflated selfworth english nationalists argued that england is the kingdom that of all the kingdoms in the world is the most like the kingdom of jesus christ and the french believed that france had a special mission as representative of the most advanced form of western culture the idea that the boundaries of a nation should as much as possible coincide with only one culture and the belief that a people who share a common language history and culture should constitute an independent nation set the stage for decades of war and border disputes on the european continent the history of alsace lorraine is a microcosm of the turbulent years of nationalism in europe and the rivalry between french and german nationalism the area was a watershed for invading french and german armies and mutual annexation the germans pursued a germanification policy in the alsace that prohibited its residents from speaking french in public a person could be fined even for something as innocent as saying “bonjour” street signs once displayed in french were replaced with german signage when the french annexed the alsace up to 0 germans were expelled and german language alsatian newspapers were suppressed the zeal of nationalism in europe and the need to define an identity for these nations states culminated with the nuremberg law it added a racial element to the concept of nationalism and ultimately contributed to the rise of nazi germany and the outbreak of world war ii by the end of the th century as the sun was setting on the ottoman empire zionists who were primarily european jews worked to create a homeland for the jewish people in palestine young turks eager to modernize their state and young arabs intellectuals primarily from the levant who also wanted to emulate the modernity of europe embarked on a nation building quest of their own all with irreconcilable claims and overlapping aspirational maps this was the framework that set the stage for the endless conflicts in the middle east that continue to plague the region today kurdish nationalists are trying to establish their own nation state from parts of turkey iraq iran and syria their ambitions have added another layer of complexity to an already intractable situation the trauma of the great depression the threat of communist revolution the rise of fascism and the ravage of world war ii made europe search for an alternative to nationalism the search for a new framework for europe was led by jean monnet and robert schuman they worked to enmesh the economies and societies of western europe with one another these new transnational ties were expected to create a permanent peace between france and germany the road to building this new post nationalist space that culminated in the creation of the european union was arduous many european politicians resisted the notion of ceding sovereignty to a supra nationalist entity the project however achieved is intended objective and europe has enjoyed the longest period of peace in its modern history in the mid 0s just  of germans thought they had more in common with other germans of different social class then with frenchmen of the same class haas  and alsace is now a multilingual region its inhabitants shop and work in both france and germany in the words of angela merkel “the europe that suffered from german hubris was transformed into a ring of friends organized around nato and the eu” the european postnationalist experiment was not without its flaws it seeded too many controls to brussels like most hierarchical systems it became topheavy and incapable of responding to change in addition there were structural flaws in the way the euro was established adding layers of popular resentment against the european project while europe is grappling with reforms of its current framework and fending off rising nationalism the middle east is still in the thrall of its failed nationalist experiment increasingly chaotic with rising religious extremism and terrorism moving forward how should the people of europe and the middle east organize themselves to achieve peace stability and economic growth today questions of identity complexity and polity are the subject of research and a new field of study by complexity theorists social scientists and historians they believe that to have a peaceful world it may not be necessary to abolish the nation state as it remains the most effective body to write and enforce the rules just to deemphasize it what we need they argue are multicultural states with overlapping authorities divided sovereignty fuzzy borders and the distribution of power to local communities   share thisemailfacebooktwittergooglereddit permalink

the whirlwind by jesse mcdonald for syria comment – june  0 nusur alzawba’a and some figures from syria since 0 the syrian social nationalist party ssnp like many political parties in the region also possesses an armed wing  in this case the ssnp’s military wing is called nusur alzawba’a which translates to ‘eagles of the whirlwind’  the whirlwind here pictured below is a reference to the vortex  hurricanelike symbol front and center of the ssnp’s logo  more on the origins of the whirlwind zawba’a in the piece immediately following this one ssnp’s emblem much has been written on the roles various militias and national defense forces ndf play fighting on assad’s side  the eagles of the whirlwind being one of these groups fighting with the syrian regime as well as hezballah also deserves attention and analysis  however diving into the groups history and motives for fighting is beyond the scope of this article  what will be touched upon is a brief overview of these fighters who have died since the beginning of 0  this article will point out which towns ssnp members were actively engaged in combat and areas with the highest casualty rates what the average age was for those who have fallen and when they joined the party  important disclosure due to lack of information on several party members this data is not fully complete  nevertheless the intention is to offer a glimpse of recent trends and structure some type of background so the reader can better comprehend the ssnp’s combat role in syria’s war let’s begin with 0 although active on numerous fronts the year 0 did not witness a particularly high mortality rate as a result of armed activities against rebels and jihadists this is in no way downplaying any low figures or loss of life  there were a total of eighteen deaths categorized into the following citiesgovernorates aleppo  raqqa countryside  hama  douma  homs  latakia 0 as one can notice latakia registered the highest casualty total out of any province in syria during 0  five of these ten deaths occurred on february  in kinsaba one of them being adonis nasr known as ‘ado’ – who led various media operations for the eagles of the whirlwind  such operations included recording fighters’ will or testimonials and preparing their autobiographies and ‘martyrdom’ posters  he also helped run the party’s daily albina’   the countryside of latakia was a particular hot spot for the eagles whirlwind in 0 with many battles taking place in the mountains strategically situated along turkey’s border and also neighboring idlib province  the coastal highlands is crucial for assad in blocking rebelheld supply lines linking up to government controlled areas in hama and creating a buffer between alawite dominated cities in latakia and tartus assad’s heartland  in fact all but two of the ten deaths in latakia countyside transpired in kinsaba the others died in kubani photo from adonis nasr’s funeral in lebanon five out of six locations mentioned above where there have been casualties are areas ssnp fighters have been heavily active  the one exception is raqqa’s countryside  in june 0 syrian government troops alongside allied militias briefly entered raqqa province only to be repelled and pushed out shortly afterwards by the socalled islamic state  it is with this brief incursion a member of the eagles whirlwind perished  however similar to other examples it appears this fighter although an ssnp member was fighting more with the syrian army than a powerful ssnp contingent are ssnp members fighting in syria universally younger or older  the average age of those who died fighting with the ssnp was around  years old  the oldest fortytwo was killed near douma while the youngest was eighteen years of age and died in homs  of the eighteen fighters mentioned at least seven were thirty years of age or older  however i was not able to determine the age of five fighters turning now to party membership  ten out of these eighteen ssnp fighters had a clear date as to when they joined the party  only two joined the eagles of the whirlwind before 0 while the other eight were either in 0 or some time after  i mention 0 in an attempt to discover whether a pattern emerges between the beginning of the war and overall length of party membership  several signed up as recently as 0 four people with the possibility of six and thus presents an interesting development for analyzing certain fighters on the front lines compared to their duration of time in the ssnp  out of the eight which could not be determined two fighters were around the age of twenty when they died  assuming they enrolled in the syrian army first at eighteen it is most likely safe to say they joined after 0 as well  albeit on a very small scale this shows members are signing up to join ssnp’s ranks fairly recently at least based on information from those who have died  as opposed to those who have been party members for an extended period of time prior to violence breaking out losing their lives on the front lines  granted this does not paint a complete accurate picture of overall party membership since just the fatalities are being examined there is debate surrounding to what degree the ssnp is a crucial fighting element for the syrian army  adding to any confusion over just how independent the ssnp is from the syrian army half of ssnp fighters who died in 0 only joined the eagles whirlwind after several military courses with the army  considering many weapons and vehicles in ssnp’s arsenal are courtesy of the syrian army and that the two fight sidebyside on several fronts more analysis is needed to determine how much leeway members have in joining without first serving in the army  besides wearing seemingly identical combat fatigues at times rendering them indistinguishable in appearance minus ssnp patches or flags it is difficult to resolve how formidable their fighting prowess is outside of any syrian army formations  in stark contrast to the tiger forces or desert hawks and obviously hezballah for example  one of these ssnp members was still in the syrian army reserves while another fought with the army where he was killed in aleppo  hence at times it appears the lines are blurred as to the sovereignty and independence of those wearing the alzawba’a patch  another important disclosure information on prior military service before fighting with the ssnp was not available for half of the deaths that occurred in 0 finally almost no one fought and died where they were born including even geographically in the same province  granted such data does not imply fighters were never active at some point near or in the same towns they were born  this is mentioned because several speculations center around whether ssnp members are able to evade serving in the syrian army often times feared on front lines in distant provinces to act instead as local protection forces in cities of their birthplace  the ssnp’s eagles whirlwind are nevertheless engaged in very active battle zones throughout multiple regions in syria  some of the more prominent or well – known areas and towns include the province of hama salamiyah mahardah suqaylabiyah and sahl al ghab plains to name a few homs city sadad alqaryatayn in homs the countryside of latakia provincejabal alakrad kubani kinsaba khammam and salma in addition to the cities of aleppo zabadani douma suwayda quneitra and the qalamoun region eagles whirlwind in 0 according to official eagles whirlwind social media pages three members have fallen so far this year in battle  one fighter each from salamiyah hama— to  years old aleppo— to 0 years old and douma— to  years of age  the fighter from aleppo seemed to be more of a symbolic presence alongside syrian army troops and various militias while the other two died as part of operations with the army one member who died in salamiyah actually is said to have been within the army’s formationsadding to previously mentioned blurred lines  additionally all three formally became ssnp party members within the last three years or so interestingly there is a split off branch from the ssnp’s eagles of the whirlwind also fighting with the syrian army  this group is called the syrian social nationalist party in the syrian arab republic  apparently rami makhlouf is their main supporter and members are more susceptible to arabism  one of these fighters was present when proregime forces advanced inside a deconfliction zone near the city of tanf on the iraqsyria border  the town hosts a base where us and british special operations soldiers are training a rebel faction for future incursions into syria’s eastern desertnear the town of deir ezzor  based on a ssnp social media site this fighter ended up succumbing to his wounds on may st after coalition jets struck the convoy on may th  he was a party member since  and along with his brother who died in 0 happened to be a founder of the ndf’s idlib branch  pictured below is a “martyrdom” poster for this fighter killed near tanf from ssnp’s group that broke away  one can clearly differentiate between this and eagles of the whirlwind posters honoring their comrades ssnp in the syrian arab republic member killed near tanf the majority of the eighteen fighters or so from the syrian social nationalist party in the syrian arab republic who have been killed since 0 occurred primarily in palmyra and aleppo  it does appear more fighters in this group fought around the towns they were born and rarely ever experienced combat in cities eagles of the whirlwind fighters were present  additional analysis regarding this development will be key in gathering potential negative effects from a split and any coinciding repercussions the ssnp’s influence may suffer as the syrian war drags on  has the assad regime strategized to split up armed groups gaining influence possibly a smart maneuver in order to gain more control over these militias which could one day threaten the regimes power  in specific areas where rebels and jihadists were defeated vast amounts of unmonitored armed militias roam the streets surely assad is plotting for what comes next to secure his grip lastly patterns are difficult to detect in only a year and a half  as such analysis within that timeframe may cause speculation  this is understandable  moreover lack of information on certain fighters coupled with an overall low death count makes sweeping declarations mere hypotheses  nevertheless the intention of this article is to act as a starting point for future studies while also laying a basic foundation to garner a better understanding of ssnp activities throughout the syrian war  ssnp fighters are very active on multiple fronts across syria witnessing some of the more strategic battles and low casualty figures since 0 should not mislead such a fact  the year 0 saw far more activity for the eagles whirlwind  more on that in the next paper  appears he is the only ssnp fighter to have died since 0 who was not born in syria  he was born in choueifat lebanon — end — the source of ssnp emblem or the whirlwind by jesse mcdonald following our previous discussion that sheds light on the eagles of the whirlwind in syria since 0 we turn to the emblem their ssnp party members display so proudly emblazoned with an eagle carrying the ssnp’s logo the “whirlwind” what is the inspiration for this symbol a combination of a cross and crescent signifying the unity and diverse makeup of the ssnp perhaps the nazi swastika or perhaps something entirely different the ssnp has vehemently denied any link between their emblem and the swastika used by the nazis this photo shows the swastika on a sumerian bowl from approximately 0 bc now i wish to expand on the early origins of alzawba’a symbols were often used throughout the ages in ancient cultures as a powerful form of expression spanning from south america to europe and continuing to the middle east while also impressing india and china such images were extremely meaningful and popular within these civilizations they explained known facts while also depicting energy of the unknown cosmic universe it is from these early times the swastika symbol was revealed to the world swastikas were a common geometrical pattern used in ancient art and did not have the same negative connotations it has today the name swastika typically means “good fortune” or “wellbeing” in the ancient indian language of sanskrit illustrations of this symbol can be found all over the world dating back ten thousand years common to antiquity periods symbols displayed in such a manner usually depicted energies of the universe fashioned around a center point notice the appearance of a whirlwind symbol in rotation along with an image of a swastika in the center below photo shows the swastika on a sumerian bowl from approximately 0 bc moving away from the swastika for a moment in this instance ssnp the universe is symbolized by a circle which is always moving in the center is the mandala a whirlwind that has a unique and close relationship with the circle the center radiates towards the circle and the circle gives depth to the center why is this relevant the ssnp believes this universe was centered in syria when the land sprouted numerous advanced and powerful civilizations thousands of years ago most of the syrian legends revolve around various cosmic and human themes most notably the emergence of the universe creation death followed by emancipation conflict construction order et cetera inheritance is the primary line it is the indistinguishable energy and the symbol is the appearance of this energy it is this focus on the centers energy specifically marked by the universe and how everything radiates around it the whirlwind image resonates with the ssnp fascination therefore does not appear to derive although not ruling out any fascist inspiration considering the time period from the nazi swastika or a combination of a crescent and cross both debated and contemplated in western media publications the whirlwind inscriptions found throughout the levant are also thought to be phoenician antoun saadeh chose the whirlwind as a symbol of the immortality of the syrian nation a symbol symbolized in more than a historical epic of the annals of syrian history saadeh expanded on the symbol when he said “the symbol of the whirlwind was found engraved on more than one fossil in syria it symbolizes the interaction of matter and spirit it symbolizes life survival immortality and within the four corners of ‘freedom duty order and power’” it appears contrary to popular debate the ssnp logo derives from a symbol dating back thousands of years found throughout the levant and mesopotamia all things considered especially when examining their ideological outlook and affinity for ancient ‘syrian’ civilizations who once dominated the region this is actually not extraordinarily surprising share thisemailfacebooktwittergooglereddit permalink  print   comments categories ssnp the end of the pkk in sinjar how the hashd alsha’bi can help resolve the yazidi genocide posted by matthew barber on tuesday may 0th 0 this article was published may 0 0 by nrt a media service in iraqi kurdistan the original article is available here photos and images have been added to this repost that were not present in the original   by matthew barber sinjar is at a pivotal moment of transition and the next phase of its future will likely be determined by what happens over the next few weeks this environment of change offers the us un and eu a significant opportunity to help resolve the political crisis in sinjar and some specific recommendations for action will be detailed in this article background on the yazidi hashd observers who have followed events in sinjar over the past few years have probably seen the kdppkk rift as the salient competition in the area this dynamic is now complicated by the presence of a third major actor the hashd alsha’bi and their quickly growing local yazidi battalions the hashd alsha’bi or popular mobilization units—pmu are mostly known as a set of shi’i militias but the hashd body or pmu committee – هيئة الحشد the institutional entity under which the hashd alsha’bi are administrated also serves as an umbrella for affiliated forces among many other iraqi communities including christians turkmen sunni arabs and yazidis initially the hashd body financially supported haider shesho’s forces in sinjar from fall 0 to april 0 but withdrew their support after his organization mismanaged hashd funds and more importantly after haider was politically pressured and attacked by the kdp he was arrested and held for nine days in april 0 by the kdp asaish after this the hashd began financially supporting the ybş a pkk affiliate in sinjar mainly comprised of local yazidis baghdad’s interest in supporting these local yazidi actors who were in political competition with the kdp has to do with sinjar’s status as a disputed territory to which baghdad and erbil both lay administrative claims the hashd body suspended financial support of the ybş in october 0 around the time when the battle for mosul began temporarily capitulating to kdp demands in order to maintain harmony among allies in this key operation this financial support has now resumed with salaries for the ybş having been paid again this month the first time since october however it is uncertain how long this support will last as this article will question the future relevance of the ybş in addition to the hashd body’s financial support for these yazidi forces in sinjar a yazidi hashd force was also created but it could not reach sinjar to participate in the fight against is because these yazidi forces were not allowed to pass through kurdistan  the yazidi hashd force was formed around a year ago by a yazidi man from khanasor who goes by the nickname of khal ali but whose official name is ali serhan eissa this name deviates from the common patronymic naming system because ali’s father’s name is walati but this name is not included in ali’s official name walati was killed in khanasor on aug  0 by is and his body is among those in one of khansor’s mass graves khal ali is therefore a genocide survivor who believed that a yazidi hashd force was the best option to provide security to sinjar the initial hashd force created for yazidis was called the lalish battalion فوج لالش the recent successes in the battle for mosul have opened up access to sinjar without the need to pass through the kurdistan region ever since is took the mosul tal afar and ba’aj areas in 0 the kdp has enjoyed exclusive control over civilian and ngo access to sinjar from within iraq a factor that has led to political problems due to the economic blockade and other measures that have prevented yazidi idps from returning to their homes this is changing as is is being cleared out of significant portions of the nineveh governorate which has allowed the yazidi hashd forces to reach the sinjar area the kdp’s failure to liberate yazidi villages south of sinjar aside from the smaller farming villages around the foothills of sinjar mountain sinjar’s main population centers are sinjar city the largest urban area located on the south side of the mountain and lines of large yazidi towns on both the north and south sides of the mountain called “collective villages” all areas to the north of the mountain were cleared of is in december 0 in november 0 the kdp peshmerga led an operation to retake sinjar city pkk forces and their affiliates not strong enough to retake the city on their own and without the us air support that accompanied the peshmerga operation joined in the brief campaign which many peshmerga commanders described to western reporters as “easy” or performed with “little resistance” upon the completion of this operation the peshmerga did not establish the front line far enough south to place the city beyond shelling range is therefore continued to shell the city beginning to use chemical weapons around february 0 which resulted in ongoing injury to yazidi peshmerga and prevented the return of civilian life to the city more important than the city which is almost entirely destroyed are the southern collective villages where most of the yazidi population of the mountain’s south side lived fearing that a largescale return of yazidi civilians could further degrade kdp influence in the area while the pkk remains a very present competitor and preclude the chance for the kdp to regain total control the kdp has not moved forward on the liberation of the southern collectives and the peshmerga have sat idle on the front line for a year and a half despite official rhetoric on “reclaiming sinjar for the yazidi people” from november 0 to the present all of the yazidi towns south of sinjar have remained under is control even though in many cases these towns have been guarded by a minimal is presence and in all cases a presence far less significant than had been the case in sinjar city this combined with the economic blockade designed to prevent yazidi civilians from returning from the camps to their homes on the north side even further exacerbated the sense of victimization that the yazidis felt visàvis the kdp these policies have contributed to significant frustrations among the yazidi peshmerga who have not been equipped with the weaponry necessary to liberate their own villages—lying just a few kilometers away—and has produced the conditions favorable for the shift of support toward the hashd alsha’bi which is underway now the current hashd alsha’bi operation in the sinjar region on may  the yazidi hashd began operations on the south side of sinjar mountain they began in the tal banat southeastern most yazidi collective village and nahiya blej arabmajority subdistrict areas this has been part of a larger operation to liberate the entire area from qayrawan to ba’aj hashd alsha’bi and yazidi forces in the process to liberate yazidis village south of sinjar when this operation began yazidis begged the peshmerga leadership to give the order to cooperate with the hashd and join the effort to liberate the yazidi towns this request was refused leading to great internal frustration among the yazidi peshmerga who had long been promised that they would receive support to liberate their homes but who

villages kdp officials and kdp media articles began to condemn the hashd demanding their withdrawal and saying that “only the peshmerga forces should liberate the remaining areas” or accusing baghdad of “ignoring article 0” referring to the iraq constitution’s article about the resolution of disputed territories it is brazen and even quite comical for kurdish officials to invoke article 0 considering the degree to which peshmerga militias have unilaterally seized many disputes territories in iraq including sinjar itself kurdish officials have also claimed that baghdad is violating an agreement with the krg in which baghdad had said that its forces “would not enter kurdish areas” ironically this position makes the kdp culpable for not liberating the yazidi collectives sooner as it places the onus of responsibility on kdp forces in a period of just over two weeks the hashd forces did more than the kdp peshmerga had accomplished in a year and a half of course the kdp is not happy amid their increasing inability to maintain the loyalty of their own troops whom they have not helped to reclaim their towns during the week of may  sarbast lazgin massoud barzani’s envoy in sinjar held a meeting with peshmerga commanders and other local officials ordering them to deal severely with any yazidi from among their troops or tribes who supported or joined the yazidi hashd yazidis who were present in the meeting report that they were told to forcibly expel from sinjar the families of anyone who joined the yazidi hashd during the meeting the kdp authorities said “anyone who joins the hashd alsha’bi can leave shingal and kurdistan and move to karbala or najaf” fakhr khalaf khoudeida arrested may  after visiting his village tal banat on may  to try to prevent yazidis from joining the yazidi hashd the kdp began blocking all movement into the areas south of the mountain in effect they were preventing yazidis from going to liberate their own villages during the beginning of the operation those desiring to join the yazidi hashd had to travel to the kurdistan region then to baghdad then through liberated mosul and then finally to the tal banattal qasab areas despite these measures intended to prevent yazidis from joining the ranks of the hashd just a few kilometers away many were willing to travel through the entire country to participate in the fight for their homes and the ranks of the hashd swelled by the hundreds from the outset a number of peshmerga also began to leave their posts during their shifts weapons in hand to join the hashd some of these were apprehended and arrested as they tried to desert but in addition to the arrests of those trying to leave peshmerga militias to join the yazidi hashd on may  kdp asaish arrested a yazidi civilian religious figure after he visited his own village tal banat newly liberated the arrested man’s name is fakhr khalaf khoudeida he is a chilagir چلەگر one of a small number of yazidis who adopt a holy somewhat ascetic lifestyle observing a 0day fast each year a possible reason for the asaish targeting him was that he met with many hashd commanders both yazidi and shi’i including the controversial hashd alsha’bi leader abu mahdi almuhandis who participated in the operation to liberate the villages on the south side of sinjar mountain fakhr was photographed meeting with these commanders in tal banat which as a religious figure lent an aura of legitimacy to the hashd forces still it was shocking to the yazidi community that kdp forces would arrest a holy man who sought to boost the morale of yazidi troops fighting is on the front line the episode reflects the growing insecurity that the kdp feels as they witness the popularity of political competitors who reject the kdp’s claim to administrative authority over sinjar fakhr khalaf khoudeida visits shi’i and yazid hashd commanders including abu mahdi almuhandis may  in tal banat or tal qasab in the current situation the kdp cannot use the argument that it directs toward pkk affiliates—that they are “foreign” forces the yazidi hashd are not only comprised of local yazidis from sinjar but they are an official force belonging to the central government nevertheless kdp media has been describing the yazidi hashd as a “shi’i force” failing to mention the yazidi battalions just as they describe the ybş as a “foreign pkk” force and fail to mention their local yazidi composition a political exodus eventually the measures to prevent yazidis from joining the hashd forces broke down as some yazidi peshmerga refused to enforce the order and began helping yazidis get through to the south side of the mountain haider shesho’s forces which also belong to the peshmerga have lost significant numbers of men as well and peshmerga defections have continued some locals estimate that the total number of yazidis who have joined the yazidi hashd in the past couple weeks is nearing 0 this does not include the yazidi lalish battalion that existed before the operation the widespread readiness of many yazidis to dissociate from the peshmerga and join these baghdadaffiliated forces is driven by growing dissatisfaction exacerbated by a number of factors – the families of these yazidi peshmerga are now nearing three full years in the camps with their lives on pause – for over a year they were prevented by the economic blockade from returning and rebuilding on sinjar’s north side – the kurdish peshmerga rojava now besiege the ybş the main defender of sinjar against is also harming the return of civilian life to snune and khanasor and – the kdp assisted turkey in bombing the bases of pkkaffiliated yazidis in sinjar who have been at the front line with is for almost three years this behavior was topped off by the refusal to allow the yazidi peshmerga to participate with the yazidi hashd in an operation to free their own towns—towns that the yazidis have desperately waited to liberate the kdp is finding itself on the wrong side of history in this development as its policy pattern inadvertently produces the perception among many yazidis that it actively works to thwart the fight against is more yazidis are joining the hashd every day and though it is too soon to tell how farreaching this trend will be we could eventually witness at least a partial collapse of the kdp peshmerga in sinjar the effect of the hashd presence on the future of pkk influence in sinjar insignia of the peshmerga rojava a force of syrian kurdish refugees recruited by kdp asaish out of refugee camps inside iraqi kurdistan and trained with turkish military support to be kdployal syrian force that can compete with the ypgpyd currently besieging ybş positions in khanasor sinjar most observers immediately assume that the new presence of the hashd alsha’bi in sinjar will be a boon to the local pkk affiliates the ybş has been besieged by the peshmerga rojava for nearly three months with its movements restricted and its fighters harassed by kdp asaish baghdad’s financial support for the ybş resumed this month and the new presence of a military competitor with the kdp would intuitively indicate an upswing in the fortunes of pkk affiliates but in fact the presence of this new “ally” will more likely spell the decline of pkk influence in sinjar even if the presence of the hashd alleviates some of the pressure facing the ybş giving it a longer lifespan than would be the case if it had no support against kdp forces and turkey the relevance of the group over the long run may wane as i have written previously yazidis have hoped that the pkk role in sinjar would be temporary most did not buy into the pkk’s larger ideological message but hoped that the pkk would act as a bulwark preventing the kdp from regaining hegemony until the yazidis could create a framework of selfadministration many yazidis have been wary of exchanging one form of singleparty kurdish rule for another but joined the ybş and its related civil administrative entities such as the “selfadministrative council” hoping to resist the kdp’s attempts to restore its dominance until a new opportunity presented itself for the creation of a more autonomous form of local governance in a sense they have succeeded in this flag of the selfadministrative council of sinjar as soon as the hashd alsha’bi arrived on the scene a crisis began inside the ybş yazidis are not only deserting the peshmerga—the ybş is also losing many fighters who are flocking to join the yazidi hashd though yazidis do not blame the ybş for not liberating the southern collectives the way they blame the peshmerga they know that the ybş have not been capable of doing it alone and yet have been highly active on the front line other frustrations have led to a gradual increase of tensions with the pkk leadership many fighters have been frustrated at the ineffectiveness of the ybş in countering the peshmerga rojava’s endeavor to thwart their mobility the local yazidis in the ybş are frustrated with the pkk leadership for not taking a tougher stance on peshmerga expansionism in the mountain but beyond these more circumstantial challenges the biggest mistake of the pkk has been its inflexibility in pushing its ideological agenda which is in many ways culturally foreign to sinjar’s yazidis the yazidis who have joined the pkkaffiliates and helped lead the selfadministrative council have repeatedly asked the pkk to empower them to create a more locallyspecific system rather than one that has to mirror pkk institutions elsewhere but as a former council member confided in me “what they promise and what they do are different” council members also feel that the pkk is not transparent with the yazidi leaders about its own political agendas which may not completely align with the goals of the local community though in word the pkk always conveys receptiveness regarding yazidi aspirations many yazidis feel that instead of delivering on these overtures the pkk ultimately wants the ybş to be an extension of the pkk in sinjar rather than giving it the freedom to be a locally distinct entity that is also part of iraq senior members of the council are therefore leaving it at the same time that many ybş fighters are leaving the ybş and joining the yazidi hashd the changing affiliation of the fighters is being prompted by both the successes of the hashd alsha’bi and the frustrations with the pkk leadership an exodus is underway from both the military and civilian organizations affiliated with the pkk in sinjar this could be the beginning of the end of the pkk in sinjar the misconception of pkk–hashd alsha’bi alignment in sinjar after turkey bombed ybş and pkk positions in sinjar several media outlets reported that the pkk and its affiliates were beginning to fly iraqi flags as a way to assert that these forces and parties were part of iraq and that by bombing them turkey was attacking baghdad flag of the ybş a local yazidi pkk affiliate in sinjar these reports were exaggerated very few iraqi flags were raised and only by a few local institutions the ybş and other pkkaffiliated militias did not adopt the iraqi flag when on march  the ybş began attacking is from the west in the siba sheikh khider area as hashd forces attacked from the east the hashd asked the ybş to halt their advance one of the main disputes was reportedly that the ybş were not flying the iraqi flag a meeting occurred the morning of may  between ybş and hashd leaders the substance of the meeting is unknown but afterwards the participation of the ybş in the siba area resumed though there has been a tacit alliance between baghdad and the pkk affiliates in sinjar primarily in the absence of baghdad forces proper it is now evident that the relationship between the hashd alsha’bi and the pkk will be uneasy on may  qasim shevan the commander of a nonpartisan force of local yazidis who stayed to defend sinjar after the genocide who has remained active yet unaffiliated up to the present declared his intention to join the yazidi hashd he and his men attempted to travel around the western end of the mountain from khanasor through bara where they would then be able to come eastward along the highway to join the hashd but at bara the pkk did not allow them to pass the next day may  fighters affiliated with “ezidi house” a yazidi political organization that advocates keeping sinjar under baghdad administration also decided to join the yazidi hashd but were likewise halted at bara by the pkk this move would not have been at all surprising coming from the kdp but was unexpected from the pkk and illustrates the fact that all three players have distinct agendas it is interesting that these groups were not stopped in khanasor by the peshmerga rojava—perhaps the kdp feels that it can no longer stem the tide now amid the massive momentum may  qasim shevan blocked by pkk in bara from joining yazidi hashd alsha’bi south of sinjar mountain here it should be pointed at that pkk personnel in bara and not yazidi ybş blocked the passage of these independent fighters traveling to hashdcontrolled territory yazidis on their own would not perform such a maneuver but the pkk tries to guide the ybş into following its agenda this was a fairly deliberate act against hashd interests what it underscores is the fact that despite the conflict between the pkk and kdp both kurdish groups see the entry of central government forces as a threat to their respective agendas in the area and like the kdp the pkk does not want to see large numbers of yazidis join the yazidi hashd on may 0 the pkk finally lifted its blockade at bara and hundreds of new men immediately joined ranks with the yazidi hashd one reason why the selfadministrative council has lost members is due to a frustration with the pkk on the issue of working with baghdad in particular the majority of sinjari yazidis see the administration of the central government as providing a greater opportunity for local yazidi governance in sinjar in contrast to affiliation with the kurdistan region which would never provide the opportunity for local administration separate from kdp control the ybş and the council as local entities have frequently tried to develop a relationship with baghdad but feel that the pkk has quietly worked to undermine this as ybş insiders report the essential pkk message is “sinjar is not part of iraq and you are not part of the iraqi forces” that this attitude characterizes the pkk approach to sinjar explains why there was little coordination between the ybş and the hashd alsha’bi when the operation south of the mountain began this month flag of the yjş the female fighters associated with the ybş consistent with this although some photos of a few ybş fighters standing with shi’i hashd alsha’bi forces were circulated on the th claims of “cooperation” between the two groups are exaggerated ybş forces came to support the fight for siba sheikh khider in the general area outside the town but their involvement was tenuous and the hashd alsha’bi ended up preventing the ybş from entering the town after the issue on the thth regarding the use of the iraqi flag the shi’i hashd alsha’bi commanders on the th expressed their objection to the participation of the female fighters of the yjş female counterpart to ybş on religious grounds after then noting the presence of pkk guerrillas accompanying the ybş forces the commanders decided not to allow any ybş forces to accompany the hashd alsha’bi into the town if the hashd forces develop a permanent presence in sinjar baghdad may begin to see the pkk affiliates as superfluous the pkk presence may also be seen by baghdad as a risk in that it could provide turkey with a pretext for ground intervention however unjustified such action would be sinjar—a part of iraq sinjar has always officially been part of nineveh administration and the central government has always provided the budget for almost all of sinjar’s services and infrastructure since  however the kdp has used strongarm tactics to push out nonkdp affiliated administrators giving its own loyalists complete control over a budget that does not originate with the kri ask almost any sinjari yazidi—in private—what they think of the kdpappointed yazidi officials in sinjar and prepare for an earful of derision officials such as the token “mayor” of sinjar can legitimately speak for very few yazidis referring to disputed territories a recent rudaw article made the claim that “most of the local population is expected to vote for full integration into the kurdistan region” in regards to sinjar the opposite is true ask sinjari yazidi idps in the camps—or those families who have returned to sinjar—in private whether they prefer to see sinjar remain under baghdad administration or become an official part of the kurdistan region and most everyone will declare a preference for baghdad this is not the expression of a special affinity for baghdad or even a rejection of the yazidi homelands as part of a “greater historical kurdistan” rather it is about the fact that central administration provides an opportunity for governance in sinjar to bear a more local character in which yazidis will be able to manage their own affairs and security without external pressure and cooptation this preference is not a wholesale rejection of the krg as much as an acute awareness of the fact that erbil’s authority over sinjar will inescapably mean kdp rule overtures of “yazidi selfadministration within the krg” are misleading and meaningless baghdad is competing with the krg for administration in many areas of iraq sinjar—the site of a recent genocide—needs to be dealt with separately from other areas whereas kurdistan may have legitimate claims to certain disputed areas sinjar is a yazidi homeland where the majority of the population maintains a preference for local administration rather than inclusion in the kri despite this talk about referendums we will never see the kdp push for a referendum on sinjar because they know that the local people will not support kdp administration there regardless of the kdp’s ceaseless claims to this disputed territory they cannot overcome the simple fact that the local majority prefers to work with the central government an iraqi yazidi solution in october 0 i joined a delegation of yazidis to washington that included tribal leaders from sinjar in the white house we met with deputy national security advisor ben rhodes who worked closely with president obama to define us policy in the middle east in the meeting the yazidis asked the us administration to empower them to create a local nonpartisan security force for sinjar rhodes replied that the us was willing to support a yazidi component within a theoretical iraqi national guard system unfortunately that support never appeared and the political competition over sinjar has only further deteriorated the new role of the hashd alsha’bi and of its affiliated yazidi battalions provides an opportunity for western governments to help end the standoff between external kurdish parties and enable the yazidis to accomplish what they have consistently asked the international community for since the first day of the genocide nonpartisan security administration and governance managed by local yazidis from sinjar and—appropriately for a context of genocide—sponsored by the international community yazidis are not calling for the kind of autonomy that the kurdistan region enjoys within iraq’s federal system but rather envision the opportunity to manage their own homeland—as part of a unified iraq—free of the scourge of singleparty rule external to sinjar the us and other western governments can help hold baghdad accountable in guaranteeing a local yazidi administration in sinjar that so many yazidis are now joining the yazidi hashd creates an opportunity to develop this local security force the yazidi hashd can be transitioned into a permanent local force in sinjar that does not necessarily need to remain a part of the hashd system but could be administered by the appropriate ministry in baghdad many of the yazidis who joined the peshmerga in sinjar will disclose that they only did so for a salary and do not possess any real loyalty to the kdp as yazidis in the kdp peshmerga and pkk affiliates join a nonpartisan security force just as they are now leaving their respective militias to join the yazidi hashd the competition on the ground in sinjar would be rendered irrelevant and the influence of these kurdish parties would decrease this would occur without an outbreak of conflict between the kdp peshmerga and the yazidi hashd as opposition to a new security order will not be significant if the ranks of peshmerga continue to dissolve the same will be the case for the ybş we have observed a refusal among the yazidi peshmerga to fight any other yazidi force which is why the kdp instead sent the nonyazidi peshmerga rojava to besiege khanasor backed up by additional peshmerga from the gergeri population of zummar who have occupied snune most yazidis just want to live a simple life in sinjar and will wholeheartedly reject party politics if a healthy alternative is provided take action now the pkk and its affiliates will always be deeply respected by sinjar’s yazidis for saving them when is besieged sinjar mountain for helping the yazidis maintain the most effective front line resistance against is in sinjar thereafter for supplying tremendous amounts of food aid to sinjar for well over a year after august  0 and for building schools and health centers for idps who built their camps on top of the mountain nevertheless the longterm objectives of the pkk in sinjar are not fully compatible with what the majority of yazidis want for their homeland a peaceful area that avoids becoming embroiled in national and regional politics or pressured to adopt identity definitions imposed by proponents of competing nationalisms the new presence in sinjar of forces affiliated with the central government has immediately diminished the importance of both the kdp and the pkk in the area if yazidis continue to join the yazidi hashd battalions the pkk will steadily fade in importance even if some diehard members who have fully embraced pkk ideology remain active the ranks of the yazidi kdp peshmerga will probably continue to decline but with the peshmerga rojava and kdp asaish in the area the kdp will endeavor to forcibly maintain its presence the international community can facilitate the transfer of authority to the new yazidi security system while helping the kdp accept the fact that it has lost the contest for popular legitimacy in sinjar kdp administration in sinjar is spotty at best and by no means indispensable it currently exists alongside the ybşaffiliated selfadministrative council—two civil administration systems simultaneously claiming legitimacy in sinjar despite the return of several thousand families to sinjar’s north side the kdp has been unable or unwilling to provide much in the way of restored infrastructure or services if the responsibility for and means to maintain security are transferred to politicallyunaffiliated local leaders with good reputations among the people the community can choose respected representatives to work with the central government in developing legitimate administration in sinjar the un us and a number of european governments have all recognized the yazidi tragedy as genocide the urgent priority therefore should be facilitating the return of the yazidi people to their homeland which is now completely free of is and assisting with the reconstruction of their infrastructure and homes without the harmful presence of kurdish militias if the roles of pkk and peshmerga militias are reduced and security responsibilities are transferred to a legal local nonpartisan yazidi force a major step will be taken to end despairdriven emigration from iraq and ensure the future survival of this minority in its homeland in the way that they themselves are requesting this is an opportunity that must be seized now share thisemailfacebooktwittergooglereddit

opportunities for further inroads by beijing or moscow—or at least to set the framework by which other external powers engage in the region—is to shore up key relationships with allies like egypt turkey israel and the gulf states this traditional engagement will polarize the middle east further and exacerbate the war in syria  us officials know that these allies are arming and supplying the most radical terrorist organizations including isis and al qaeda in their bid for regional influence the traditional us  peacebuilding effort in the middle east has focused on individual conflicts and has yielded precious little despite intense effort by several american administrations neoconservatives who argued that the promotion of liberal democracies is a precondition to peace in the middle east have pushed for regime change in many countries in the region only to see violence extremism and terrorism reach new heights all at a huge cost to the american taxpayer the chinese approach to the middle east will be different according to yang guang the chinese solution would pair a regional approach with economic development this is a much different and likely a better approach to peace building in the middle east it is clear that the syrian crisis is a regional war and the kurdish issue is a regional issue as is the israeli – palestinian issue the chinese would also have an easier time than the us facilitating dialogue in the region china won’t be viscerally rejected by the leftists in the region and is less suspect than the europeans whose colonial history in the middle east

what seems today as perpetual war began with the rise of nationalism in the middle east at the turn of the twentieth century when it comes to the middle east today all the major global powers are engaged in reactionary stopgap measures what the region needs is a departure from nationalist and identity politics  creating the conditions and framework in which nationalistic and identity politics

comments categories china farah peace us uyghurs reconciliations the case of alsanamayn in north deraa posted by aymenn altamimi on thursday april th 0 by aymenn jawad altamimi photo from alsanamayn april 0 it is often thought that the regime has a grand strategy for suppressing the rebellion in the western half of the country that constitutes the main conflict within the syrian civil war in reality though there is no onesizefitsall approach and the question of how the regime deals with restive areas very much depends on area and circumstances in some places a sunnialawite sectarian faultline has influenced the regime’s approach thus we see a clear demographic shift in the city of homs in favour of the alawites with the rebellious and predominantly sunni neighbourhoods largely depopulated indeed it seems unlikely that the majority of the original inhabitants of those neighbourhoods will return for the foreseeable future some areas that are not tied to this sectarian faultline but proved to be a thorn in the regime’s side for years such as darayya a suburb to the south of damascus will also likely remain depopulated for the time being indeed as of the time of writing darayya remains a military zone that can only be visited with a special permit even for shi’i pilgrims who may want to see the largely ruined sakina shrine in the area however it would not be feasible for the regime to depopulate every restive area it is in this context that the mechanism of ‘reconciliation’ musalaha exists whereby an agreement is struck in order to bring an area officially back under regime authority the exact terms of the reconciliation agreements have varied from place to place perhaps reflecting some experimentation this article will focus on the case of alsanamayn a town in north deraa province where a reconciliation agreement was struck at the end of december 0 it is of course also important to give the context of the agreement thus this article will first provide a general description of the town and its history during the syrian civil war unlike some other deraa localities alsanamayn has no shi’i population rather it is entirely sunni the populations of deraa localities can also normally be divided into the most important extended familiesclans in alsanamayn these families are – alatmeh – alnasar – alfalah – allabad – aldhiyab – alhaimid – alshatar in addition to the original population the town also hosts a number of people internally displaced from nearby villages over the course of the syrian civil war on account of its location the town of alsanamayn has been regarded as an important strategic point from the rebel perspective capturing the town could have served as a ‘gateway’ to connect with the rebelheld areas in the damascus countryside and suburbs and thus launch a serious fight to take damascus from the regime however in light of the regime’s consolidation of control of much of the damascus area since 00 and the constraints faced by the southern front primarily consisting of local free syrian armybanner units working with an operations room in amman any notions of taking damascus from the regime can only be seen as fanciful at this stage for the regime the alsanamayn area is home to an important base for the syrian army’s th division serving as a logistics point and a position to fire on rebel positions in the wider north deraa area the alsanamayn area also has a base for the th brigade affiliated with the th division in addition alsanamayn bears some industrial importance for the regime’s development plans in deraa as alsanamayn is supposed to feature an industrial area that was partly the subject of a recent conference attended by the artisans union and the deraa provincial governor muhammad khalid alhanus there are also some personal loyalist connections to alsanamayn most importantly the head of the deraa province branch of the ba’ath party kamal alatmeh– is from alsanamayn though there was never a major battle waged by rebels from outside the town to advance into alsanamayn and take control of it the town saw the rise of a number of local rebel factions within its neighbourhoods this development is hardly surprising considering that the town saw protests against the regime on multiple occasions in 0 indicating the existence of considerable popular discontent in late march 0 a violent crackdown on protests in alsanamayn occurred dubbed a massacre in proopposition media a protest on  november 0 in alsanamayn the banner in the name of “revolutionaries of alsanamayn” reads “we don’t love you” the syrian arabic ma manhibbak– is a play on the common slogan in support of assad manhibbak “we love you” the town of alsanamayn has never featured some of the more familiar names of the syrian insurgency like jabhat alnusra or ahrar alsham even as many rebels of alsanamayn origin have participated in fighting outside the area instead the factions that emerged within alsanamayn derived from a strictly local basis the first faction to arise in alsanamayn was katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn “the alsanamayn martyrs battalion” in late 0 under the leadership of abu fadi alsaydali real name muhammad jaber alatmeh who worked as a service taxi driver between damascus and alsanamayn before the uprising other local groups were then formed through the course of 0 as rebel forces inside alsanamayn gained strength most notably in may 0 came the announcement of the group katibat nusrat alhaq “supporting the truth battalion” under the leadership of one abd allatif alhaimid who studied at the shari’i college in damascus university and taught islamic education thus the use of the honorific title of sheikh in reference to him soon after it was formed katibat nusrat alhaq came into conflict with katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn which accused the group of engaging in criminal behaviour through taking money from civilians in the alsanamayn area under threat of arms while falsely using katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn’s name and the pretext of buying weapons for the battalion notice the deriding of abd allatif alhaimid’s title of sheikh by katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn the other side of the story is the claim that this dispute was rooted in alsaydali’s perception that katibat nusrat alhaq posed a threat to his influence over the rebel milieu in alsanamayn as abd allatif alhaimid was supposedly not the sort of character who could have sanctioned criminal behaviour in light of his islamic background abd allatif alhaimid was found dead at the end of 0 in rather murky circumstances while outside of alsanamayn though accusations of kidnapping and assassination were directed at the mujahideen of hawran battalion affiliated with the group liwa hamza assad allah with which katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn also had links in 0 like many other rebel environments the alsanamayn area saw its share of faction merger initiatives in february 0 came the announcement of the formation of liwa sha’alat althawra “fire of the revolution brigade” likely a homage to the title of sha’alat althawra that has become associated with alsanamayn with a purview beyond the town of alsanamayn the brigade was declared to be “operating in the northwest region of deraa province” the formation statement declared the leader to be yahya alrifa’i with one maher allabad as his deputy while alsaydali would serve as the head of civil affairs for the group probably owing to tensions with alsaydali katibat nusrat alhaq did not join the initiative later in july 0 maher allabad would also found his own contingent liwa fajr altahrir “dawn of liberation brigade” though that did not necessarily amount to a defection from liwa sha’alat althawra the names of both liwa fajr altahrir and liwa sha’alat althawra are mentioned in conducting operations against regime forces in the months following the former’s formation the links between the two are also illustrated by the fact that they have adopted the same subsequent affiliations mostly recently being affiliated to the southern front’s th infantry division the main difference now is that liwa fajr altahrir maintains a presence inside alsanamayn city whereas liwa sha’alat althawra does not as for katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn it had apparently gone its own way by 0 as alsaydali had allegedly sought to marginalise others like maher allabad in liwa sha’alat althawra and claim the leadership for himself there were also claims of criminal behaviour and imposition of extortion fees on civilians as the rebel presence inside alsanamayn town developed a limited form of civil society embodied in local councils emerged the first local council was announced on social media in august 0 another local council was announced in november 0 the local council announced in november 0 still exists to this day is headed by one yassin alatmeh himself currently based in jordan and is affiliated with the deraa provincial council tied to the syrian interim government this local council was also tied to the union of local councils in deraa province an initiative headed by one ali ahmad alrakab who is based in the gulf region but subsequently withdrew from it and urged all aid organizations not to work with it for provision of any aid to alsanamayn its authority was most notably backed by liwa sha’alat althawra’s leadership in a statement in late october 0 meanwhile the local council that had been declared on social media in august 0 joined the union of local councils in deraa province and enjoyed backing from several of alsanamayn’s factions including katibat nusrat alhaq and liwa ummat altawheed about which more later in the end though over the course of 0 the local council under yassin alatmeh prevailed likely because it had stronger support even so it should be noted that despite the apparent comprehensiveness of the offices announced for the local councils most of the public services in alsanamayn have been provided throughout by the regime the local council bodies have instead been limited to distribution of gifts and aid on particular occasions cf here and here according to yassin alatmeh his local council which on the ground in alsanamayn is presently headed by one altayyib abu alnur continues some of these activities today telling me “the council still provides what it can to aid the orphans and the sons of those detained along with aid from organizations and the people of benevolence who have taken it upon themselves to pay sums for the orphans” all that said there are allegations that yassin alatmeh has enriched himself along with muhammad jaber alatmeh through corruption and theft of local council money so how did the reconciliation come about as mentioned above rebel forces inside alsanamayn gained strength through 0 while service provision by the regime remained large parts of alsanamayn effectively fell outside of regime control the main exceptions were the market road and the general road in alsanamayn the rebels would target regime positions and bases with projectiles or engage in relatively smallscale clashes instances of kidnappings by one side would lead to titfortat escalation the worst such incident appears to have been a massacre conducted by regime forces in april 0 reportedly killing more than 0 people in an assault that was focused on alsanamayn’s southern neighbourhoods civilians would sometimes be caught in the crossfire more generally for instance in november 0 at least one civilian was killed and a number of others wounded as rebel mortar fire landed at the site of the bakery the regime’s main leverage over the rebel factions in alsanamayn was to impose a siege on the neighbourhoods in which the rebels had effective control blocking access to commodities and goods thus in december 0 the regime’s forces imposed a blockade on those neighbourhoods reportedly in retaliation for the rebel factions targeting a car carrying an army officer and a number of personnel the rebel factions in turn had reportedly carried out the attack in response to the arrest of a youth from alsanamayn at one of the regime checkpoints around the town the blockade was lifted after negotiations between the rebel factions and the regime forces on condition that the rebels do not attack regime positions or personnel another condition of this virtual ceasefire was that people in alsanamayn should be able to participate in the subsequent parliamentary elections which took place in april 0 the regime would go on to impose a new siege on the rebelheld areas of alsanamayn in response to a perceived violation of the de facto truce as a man called imad allabad and his group well known for criminality among the people of alsanamayn had stolen a number of cars including one belonging to one of the regime’s security apparatuses the regime then used this opportunity to try to resolve the problems it faced in alsanamayn by pressing for a reconciliation agreement rebel opinion was divided at the time regarding how to respond to the new siege liwa ummat altawheed based only inside of alsanamayn rejected the idea put forward mostly by alsanamayn rebels based outside the town to target the regime’s military points inside the town fearing the consequences for those already besieged inside the town there does appear to have been some outside rebel firing on the town to target the regime which killed at least one civilian the pressure created by the siege was a contributing factor to negotiations in december 0 and the formal reconciliation agreement towards the end of that month key to the negotiation of this agreement on the regime side was wafiq nasir head of the military intelligence in southern syria wafiq nasir is widely disliked among more thirdway druze in deraa’s neighbouring province of suwayda’ where his authority also applies the other key figure on the regime side was the head of the syrian army’s th division intermediaries in the reconciliation agreement were jamal alasha head of the reconciliation committee in alsanamayn and one antar allabad who is accused of dealing in stolen cars wider theft and of being close to wafiq nasir he had set up his own very small armed group that was initially on the side of the rebels but well before the reconciliation he had established relations with the regime during the siege of alsanamayn prior to the reconciliation he was able to use his influence to bring about a lifting of the siege at the end of november 0 jamal alasha is apparently of the allabad family with his son allegedly on the side of the rebels and based in nawa both a jamal allabad and an antar allabad are named along with a number of other locals by proopposition outlet zaman alwasl as those who had been pushing for a reconciliation agreement in alsanamayn to avoid a darayyastyle scenario observe that the family names of those named by zaman alwasl indicate that they are mostly from alsanamayn’s biggest families the reconciliation agreement did not require a formal undertaking of the reconciliation process by every inhabitant of alsanamayn rather the idea was that a certain number of people would undertake the process to represent the entire town the proopposition outlet almodon says that the reconciliation was imposed on a clan basis that is that each clanextended family should have a representation in the reconciliation agreement for its part the regime’s state media outlet sana claimed on  december 0 that 0 people in alsanamayn among them 0 “armed men” carried out taswiyat alwad’ “sorting out of affairs” as part of the reconciliation while handing over weapons to the security apparatuses no one inside alsanamayn was compelled to leave for idlib or other rebelheld areas among those who formally reconciled one important motive to undergo reconciliation would be to deal with the problem of being wanted for military service in this case taswiyat alwad’ would grant a temporary formal respite as for the rebel factions inside alsanamayn it is clear that not every member or even leader of every faction formally reconciled and handed over weapons indeed there was no requirement for them all to do so and any formal reconciliation on the part of the rebels can be seen as symbolic the most notable rebel faction leader who formally reconciled was tha’ir alfalah leader of liwa ummat altawheed in contrast abu fadi alsaydali leader of katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn did not formally reconcile though he did meet with wafiq nasir it must be emphasised that while not every rebel or rebel leader inside alsanamayn formally reconciled all the rebel factions operating inside the town have agreed to abide by the state of affairs imposed by the reconciliation this situation is not all that different from the agreement struck after the lifting of the siege in december 0 thus as of now the factions still exist inside of alsanamayn and have kept hold of many of their weapons but they do not attack any regime positions or personnel meanwhile the regime provides services as usual maintains state institutions in the town and allows regular flow of commodities and goods to all areas of the town also as will be recalled from above the local council of yassin alatmeh still exists at a very modest level as before furthermore the regime’s army and security forces do not generally intervene in security and criminal incidents in the town allowing the factions to deal with these matters while legal affairs such as marriage are dealt with by the regime’s court system thus the regime avoids arresting anyone inside alsanamayn that said the regime has helped to set up a new faction inside alsanamayn to try to help maintain security in the town about which more below at present the main factions inside alsanamayn are – katibat shuhada’ alsanamayn of abu fadi alsaydali – liwa ummat altawheed of tha’ir alfalah aka tha’ir alabbas – liwa fajr altahrir of maher allabad though maher allabad is not inside alsanamayn by virtue of links to liwa sha’alat althawra and the th infantry division there is a presence for this group outside alsanamayn as well – katibat maghawir alhaq led by one abu zaher allabad real name barhum mahmoud allabad a new group created after the release of abu zaher allabad from prison as per the reconciliation agreement requiring the release of sets of detainees the group mostly contains people from the allabad family and was set up with help from the military intelligence in addition to these factions there are some smaller armed groups each of which does not have more than 0 people these groups may constitute criminal gangs andor partly reflect remnants of alsanamayn’s minor factions from earlier years muhammad khalif the leader of katibat dir’ alsanamayn aka liwa dir’ alsanamayn and a representative on his behalf for instance insisted to me that his group is still a real actor on the ground in alsanamayn recall the group’s name among the signatories that backed the local council that lost out to yassin alatmeh’s outfit yet a media activist in alsanamayn abu alawras alshami insisted that the group does not have a presence on the ground and was dissolved some time ago the reality is perhaps somewhere in between it may be the case that katibat dir’ alsanamayn no longer exists as a meaningful name on the ground in the town but perhaps khalif can call on some armed supporters in times of trouble for him or his family other factions of note and bearing the name of alsanamayn eg liwa shuhada’ alsanamayn of the tajammu’ alwiyat alomari and liwa suqur alsanamayn of the first army do not have a presence inside alsanamayn at present but are operating in other rebelheld areas in the south foreign militias supporting the regime like hezbollah do not maintain a presence inside alsanamayn or try to recruit from the people of alsanamayn with the at least temporary respite in conscription the regime has opened an office in alsanamayn aiming to recruit people into the fifth legion a formation strongly backed by russia and intended to recruit people on a voluntary basis with substantial benefits including those who have done taswiyat alwad’ alsanamayn april 0 so on the whole how is life in alsanamayn after the reconciliation commenting in general on the reconciliation the media representative for muhammad khalif did not necessarily object to it clarifying “if these reconciliations prevent bloodshed we all welcome them…the reconciliation happened through pressure from the people of alsanamayn town on the revolutionaries present inside because all the revolutionaries of alsanamayn are from the people of the town” for many oppositionrebel supporters and activists the reconciliation amounts to little more than cynical regime propaganda “this reconciliation arose for media purposes for the regime’s interest only in order to promote reconciliations to the rest of the localities in deraa province” said aboud alhawrani an activist for the proopposition “revolutionaries of alsanamayn” media office he elaborated “even before the reconciliation alsanamayn was in a state of ceasefire with the regime referring to the agreement in december 0  and the problems that arose with the regime arose on an individual basis only ie if the regime arrested one of someone’s relatives that person would cause problems with the regime like kidnapping military personnel and firing on a military zone…this state of affairs remains the case even after the reconciliation this reconciliation is a media movement only for the regime on the basis that alsanamayn has come under complete control” other people in alsanamayn with whom i spoke agreed with the basic point that the current situation is little different from the previous status quo ie the one prior to the siege imposed just before the reconciliation in this state of affairs the existence of multiple armed factions and gangs without a real central intervening authority poses an important problem for those who just want greater stability order and ruleoflaw indeed ala’ aldin allabad one of the individuals named by zaman alwasl as being behind the efforts to push for a reconciliation seemed gloomy about the current situation he was never a supporter of the opposition but not necessarily an ideological loyalist of the regime rather his primary desires are stability and security “the situation is like the silence before the storm” he said he went on to explain “when arms spread in the hands of the ignorant there is much killing as well as treachery extortion and theft this is our state of affairs now” he also pointed out the poor state of services provision affirming that “there is one hour of very weak and intermittent electricity for every four hours it is cut off water is available for  hours a week insufficient” the provision of national grid electricity arabic kahraba’ wataniya by a ratio of around  hours for every  hours it is cut off was corroborated by others residing in alsanamayn at this stage the main factions inside alsanamayn primarily amount to claninterest groups as tha’ir alfalah explained “we no longer have political factions in alsanamayn they have become clan factions every armed person affiliated with his family” thus his group liwa ummat altawheed mostly consists of members of the alfalah clan that primarily inhabits the northeastern part of the town abu alawras alshami himself from the alhaimid family offered a similar assessment “in the recent time the armed factions in alsanamayn have become clan factions that is every family has armed men from its sons whose aim is to protect the family from any attack” when this point is taken into account along with the existence of criminal gangs ala’ aldin allabad’s concerns about lack of security are hardly surprising as abu alawras alshami also explained “there are many security problems in the town from theft kidnapping and assault on the people by force of arms and no one can put a stop to these criminals” one example of these problems is an incident that received some opposition media attention around a month ago as it involved the new katibat maghawir alhaq the event a clash that killed at least one person and wounded a number of people was portrayed in the proopposition media outlet allsyria as a clash along loyalistrebel lines katibat maghawir alhaq vs “the battalions of the revolutionaries” in fact this portrayal is quite offbase fundamentally the incident involved clashes between members of the aldhiyab family and members of the allabad family the roots of the issue lie in an attempt by at least two people from the aldhiyab family apparently members of a notorious criminal gang led by one nadim aldhiyab to impose an extortion fee on a shop allegedly demanding 0 syrian pounds and threatening to burn the shop if the owner did not pay the extortion fee this threat was rejected by the shop owner who then contacted barhum allabad to intervene barhum allabad then came with one abu abdo alshatar and someone else from the allabad family and tried to get the gang members to leave when they refused one of them was shot in the leg barhum then sent men to members of the aldhiyab family to try to prevent a wider clash despite an apparent initial agreement from the wider aldhiyab family there was then an assault by members of the aldhiyab family on the harat allabad the part of the town where the allabad family is found in large numbers also of note with regards to allsyria’s coverage of the incident is the claim that katibat maghawir alhaq is affiliated with the fifth legion an interesting followup item was posted on allsyria in which katibat maghawir alhaq ostensibly denied this affiliation in a statement which is reproduced below the statement at first sight has all the trappings of a typical deraa rebel faction using the monikers of  “the free syrian army” and “the southern front” the statement includes revolutionary affirmations like the following “our complete readiness…to defend our land against the assadist criminal gangs” it concludes with the declaration “victory to our blessed revolution” the interesting thing about this statement though is that it may not have been written by abu zaher allabad at all but rather maher allabad who was angered by allsyria’s claim about katibat maghawir alhaq and told abu alawras alshami that he intended for an apology statement from allsyria as he considered that allsyria’s article would be harmful to the allabad family in any case the conflict involving katibat maghawir alhaq required intervention from wafiq nasir according to tha’ir alfalah wafiq nasir has formally distanced himself and the military intelligence from the faction in statements to the people of alsanamayn tha’ir alfalah attributes this distancing to the problem of this clash adding that “maghawir alhaq is a faction that does not have popular support in alsanamayn the town has agreed on this point” a more sympathetic view of the faction was offered by ala’ aldin allabad portraying it as a group dedicated to cracking down on criminal behaviour family affiliation biases are likely at play here tha’ir alfalah’s own faction was involved in a minor clash this month after a member of an armed gang demanded that a doctor provide him with free treatment threatening him with his weapons when the doctor refused the member of the armed gang attacked him and opened fire on his clinic prompting an intervention from tha’ir alfalah resulting in a clash that lasted no more than a matter of minutes afterwards the armed gang came to liwa ummat altawheed’s base and apologised to the doctor resolving the case it would be a mistake to presume that all conflicts inside alsanamayn are between members of different families just as not all conflicts within iraq and syria more generally take place along ethnoreligious sectarian lines a recent case that culminated in a trial and execution of the accused by qisas ruling involved people from the same clan alatmeh in particular a young man called ismail yahya alatmeh a member of abu fadi alsaydali’s faction killed a father and son also of the alatmeh clan in a quarrel after much pressure from people in alsanamayn on abu fadi alsaydali ismail alatmeh was arrested and he then acknowledged his crime interestingly in keeping with the regime’s general noninterference in security and criminal matters in alsanamayn the case was referred to the dar al‘adl “abode of justice” the main rebel judicial authority in southern syria to be sure the dar al‘adl does not have a base in alsanamayn rather the connection was done remotely ismail alatmeh fled from his imprisonment but was recaptured he was then executed in accordance with the qisas ruling at dawn on  april the security problems in alsanamayn are recognised to a degree by the leadership of the main factions thus on the night of  april there was a meeting involving the faction leaders and town notables the principal outcome of this meeting was that the majority agreed on the need to form a security force that has joint participation from all the factions and families the meeting also pointed to the wider lack of popular support for katibat maghawir alhaq with the consensus view being that its members do not adhere to good conduct or values and town notables opined that it should not be entrusted to deal with security problems alone that said it remains to be seen how exactly the joint security force will be constituted and whether it will lead to something that endures practically on the ground alsanamayn april 0 the situation in alsanamayn bears a number of analytical implications for wider analysis of how the regime will deal with restive areas it is clear that alsanamayn is considered by the regime to be a model for how it should eventually deal with the wider rebelheld south facing wider manpower shortages it would not be feasible for the regime to retake every deraa province town by sheer force and depopulation which would also risk further largescale displacements towards jordan and likely upset the jordanian government’s less hostile stance in comparison with some other regional players towards the regime instead some kind of accommodation with what are largely local more malleable factions granting them autonomy in security affairs within ‘reconciled’ localities is the most realistic option for the regime even as alsanamayn is not a wholly identical situation because it never fell entirely out of regime control and arguably has more strategic importance than an entirely rebelheld town like nawa for the rebel factions a possible additional motive to ‘reconcile’ is the risk of feeling trapped in a pincer between the regime’s forces and its allies on one side and the islamic statelinked jaysh khalid bin alwaleed on the other which exploited rebel weaknesses to secure some advances earlier this year civilian pressure on account of war weariness may also be a motive to settle with reconciliation agreements at the same time it is clear that this model does not come without its problems namely an atmosphere of lawlessness created by the large number of armed factions and gangs this phenomenon exists elsewhere in regimeheld territory on account of reliance on auxiliary militias even as the regime continues to provide services and government jobs in those areas the difference in alsanamayn from those other regimeheld areas is that the factions occupy a curious limbo position whereby they do not attack any regime positions or personnel and the syrian state institutions function in their place but they are appealing to a rebelopposition judicial authority dar al‘adl to resolve at least some criminal cases within areas controlled by jaysh khalid bin alwaleed it is clear from some civilian residents that one perceived advantage of the group’s rule is that it is rule by one faction and thus brings a sense of order this issue might make the group’s rule more attractive than continued formal rebel control or a reconciliation agreement on the model of alsanamayn could the alsanamayn reconciliation framework be applied elsewhere in syria especially in idlib province that is the last epicentre for the insurgency’s conflict with the regime it seems more doubtful on account of the dominance of far more irreconcilable and ideologically hardline elements such as hay’at tahrir alsham and ahrar alsham to be sure both of these factions were important inside the damascus countryside towns of madaya and zabadani on the border with lebanon that were the subject of recent mutual evacuation agreements but the negotiations took place and were exceptional in nature most notably because there was leverage over iran in besieging the two idlib shi’i towns of alfu’a and kafariya for hay’at tahrir alsham in idlib more generally there is no further leverage in trying to resist a forthcoming push by the regime and its allies into idlib it is more likely in the endgame to go with alqa’ida leader ayman alzawahiri’s advice to move away from the idea of controlling territory and instead focus on guerrilla tactics share
