following httpwwwsecgovcgibinbrowseedgaractiongetcompanycik frequently asked questions how much experience does the manager have with managing convertible equity and fixedincome securities advent has been managing convertible securities since inception in  and the experience of the portfolio managers goes back well beyond that at their previous employers advent has managed highyield securities opportunistically in their convertible strategies and manages a dedicated highyield convertible strategy what is advents investment process convertible and highyield securities universe screen  advent uses three quantitative models to identify convertible and highyield securities with what they believe are attractive riskreward characteristics credit analysis  the creditworthiness of the security is reviewed using five years of financial data interest coverage ratios debt to capitalization and cash flows and the last two years quarterly statements advent is most interested in companies with stable to improving trends in financial ratios this step is critical to reducing risk advent evaluates credits for all its holdings while the credit committee evaluates credit on many corporate securities beyond those that just have convertibles outstanding to give a complete look at an industrys status and outlook fundamental analysis  each company is analyzed from a fundamental perspective using company financial statements industry data and meeting with or speaking with management underlying equity fundamentals are examined to identify company andor industry dynamics that could act as catalysts for favorable performance these include accelerating earnings momentum changing industry dynamics new product announcements or corporate developments like a restructuring because advent is located in new york city it has a distinct research advantage in being able to meet with company managements who frequently visit the financial center for meetings presentations and conferences inhouse research reports are produced with an investment opinion portfolio monitoring  advent continually monitors its portfolios to determine whether each holding is maintaining its investment potential what evaluation process does advent use when selecting convertible securities advent looks at each convertible security in three ways one evaluating it with a convertiblepricing model as a financial instrument with certain riskreward characteristics and upsidedownside potential two evaluating the credit and three evaluating the underlying common stock through fundamental research why a leveraged fund leveraged closed end funds offer investors the opportunity to purchase shares of a fund whose dividend yields generally are designed to be higher than those of similar unleveraged investments at the same time leverage introduces or heightens certain investment risks as a result understanding leverage its benefits and risks plays an important role in determining whether a leveraged fund is the right investment leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares including the likelihood of greater volatility of nav and market price of the fund’s common shares fluctuations in the dividend rates and possible increased operating costs which may reduce the fund’s total return describe the differences between closedend and openend funds an openend fund may be purchased or sold at nav plus sales charge in some cases an openend fund will issue new shares when an investor wants to purchases shares in the fund and will sell assets to redeem shares when an investor wants to sell shares when selling an openend fund the price the seller receives is established at the close of the market when the nav is calculated unlike the openend fund a closedend fund has a limited number of shares outstanding and trades on an exchange at the market price based on supply and demand an investor may purchase or sell shares at market price while the exchange is open the common shares may trade at a discount or premium to the nav what does the exdiv or the exdividend date refer to every month the fund pays dividends and those investors who purchase the fund before the exdividend date will receive the next dividend distribution investors who purchase on or after the exdividend date will not receive the next dividend distribution the value of the dividend is subtracted from the funds nav on the exdividend date each month so when the nav is reported with an exdiv behind it this means that the amount of the dividend has already been taken out of the nav what is the drip and how is its price determined drip is the dividend reinvestment plan the drip price is the cost per share for all participants in the reinvestment plan the drip price is determined by one of two scenarios one if the common shares are trading at a discount the drip price is the weighted average cost to purchase the common shares from the nyse or elsewhere lastly if the common shares are trading at a premium the drip price is the determined either the higher of the nav or approximately  of the common share price how many shares

management llc  avenue of the americas th floor new york ny  risks investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund an investment in the fund is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest not a complete investment program an investment in the common shares of the fund should not be considered a complete investment program the fund is intended for longterm investors seeking total return through a combination of current income and capital appreciation the fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish to play shortterm swings in the stock market each common shareholder should take into account the fund’s investment objective as well as the common shareholder’s other investments when considering an investment in the fund investment and market risk an investment in common shares of the fund is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest an investment in the common shares of the fund represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund the value of the securities owned by the fund may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably which will affect the net asset value and may affect the market price of the common shares the value of securities owned by the fund may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular issuer such as real or perceived economic conditions changes in interest or currency rates or changes in investor sentiment or market outlook generally at any point in time your common shares may be worth less than your original investment including the reinvestment of fund dividends and distributions market discount risk shares of closedend management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value which is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the fund’s net asset value could decrease as a result of its investment activities although the value of the fund’s net assets is generally considered by market participants in determining whether to purchase or sell common shares and at what price to do so whether investors will realize gains or losses upon the sale of common shares will depend entirely upon whether the market price of common shares at the time of sale is above or below the investor’s purchase price for common shares because the market price of common shares will be determined by factors such as net asset value dividend and distribution levels which are dependent in part on expenses supply of and demand for common shares stability of dividends or distributions trading volume of common shares general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control of the fund the fund cannot predict whether common shares will trade at below or above net asset value or at below or above an investor’s initial purchase price for common shares convertible securities risk convertible securities are hybrid securities that combine the investment characteristics of bonds and common stocks convertible securities involve risks similar to those of both fixed income and equity securities in a corporations capital structure convertible securities are senior to common stock but are usually subordinated to senior debt obligations of the issuer the market value of a convertible security is a function of its investment value and its conversion value a securitys investment value represents the value of the security without its conversion feature ie a nonconvertible fixed income security the investment value may be determined by reference to its credit quality and the current value of its yield to maturity or probable call date at any given time investment value is dependent upon such factors as the general level of interest rates the yield of similar nonconvertible securities the financial strength of the issuer and the seniority of the security in the issuers capital structure a securitys conversion value is determined by multiplying the number of shares the holder is entitled to receive upon conversion or exchange by the current price of the underlying security if the conversion value of a convertible security is significantly below its investment value the convertible security will trade like nonconvertible debt or preferred stock and its market value will not be influenced greatly by fluctuations in the market price of the underlying security in that circumstance the convertible security takes on the characteristics of a bond and its price moves in the opposite direction from interest rates conversely if the conversion value of a convertible security is near or above its investment value the market value of the convertible security will be more heavily influenced by fluctuations in the market price of the underlying security in that case the convertible securitys price may be as volatile as that of common stock because both interest rates and market movements can influence its value a convertible security generally is not as sensitive to interest rates as a similar fixed income security nor is it as sensitive to changes in share price as its underlying equity security convertible securities are often rated below investment grade or are not rated although all markets are prone to change over time the generally high rate at which convertible securities are retired through mandatory or scheduled conversions by issuers or through voluntary redemptions by holders and replaced with newly issued convertibles may cause the convertible securities market to change more rapidly than other markets for example a concentration of available convertible securities in a few economic sectors could elevate the sensitivity of the convertible securities market to the volatility of the equity markets and to the specific risks of those sectors moreover convertible securities with innovative structures such as mandatoryconversion securities and equitylinked securities have increased the sensitivity of the convertible securities market to the volatility of the equity markets and to the special risks of those innovations which may include risks different from and possibly greater than those associated with traditional convertible securities a convertible security may be subject to redemption at the option of the issuer at a price set in the governing instrument of the convertible security if a convertible security held by the fund is subject to such redemption option and is called for redemption the fund must allow the issuer to redeem the security convert it into the underlying common stock or sell the security to a third party as a result of the conversion feature convertible securities typically offer lower interest rates than if the securities were not convertible during periods of rising interest rates it is possible that the potential for capital gain on convertible securities may be less than that of a common stock equivalent if the yield on the convertible security is at a level that would cause it to sell at discount also in the absence of adequate antidilution provisions in a convertible security dilution in the value of the funds holding may occur in the event the underlying stock is subdivided additional securities are issued a stock dividend is declared or the issuer enters into another type of corporate transaction which increases its outstanding securities structured and synthetic convertible securities risk the value of structured and synthetic convertible securities can be affected by interest rate changes and credit risks of the issuer such securities may be structured in ways that limit their potential for capital appreciation and the entire value of the security may be at a risk of loss depending on the performance of the underlying equity security structured and synthetic convertible securities may be less liquid than other convertible securities the value of a synthetic convertible security will respond differently to market fluctuations than a convertible security because a synthetic convertible security is composed of two or more separate securities each with its own market value in addition if the value of the underlying common stock or the level of the index involved in the convertible component falls below the exercise price of the warrant or option the warrant or option may lose all value equity securities risk equity securities risk is the risk that the value of the securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate or factors relating to specific companies in which the fund invests stock of an issuer in the fund’s portfolio may decline in price if the issuer fails to make anticipated dividend payments because among other reasons the issuer of the security experiences a decline in its financial condition common stock in which the fund may invest is structurally subordinated to preferred stock bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater dividend risk than preferred stock or debt instruments of such issuers in addition while common stock has historically generated higher average returns than fixed income securities common stock has also experienced significantly more volatility in those returns an adverse event such as an unfavorable earnings report may depress the value of common stock of an issuer held by the fund common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change these investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political economic and banking crises interest rate risk convertible securities and nonconvertible incomeproducing securities including preferred stock and debt securities collectively “income securities” are subject to certain interest rate risks including if interest rates go up the value of income securities in the fund’s portfolio generally will decline these risks may be greater in the current market environment because interest rates are near historically low levels during periods of declining interest rates the issuer of an income security may exercise its option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled forcing the fund to reinvest in lower yielding income securities this is known as call or prepayment risk lower grade income securities have call features that allow the issuer to repurchase the security prior to its stated maturity an issuer may redeem a lower grade income security if the issuer can refinance the security at a lower cost due to declining interest rates or an improvement in the credit standing of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates the average life of certain types of income securities may be extended because of slower than expected principal payments this may lock in a below market interest rate increase the security’s duration the estimated period until the security is paid in full and reduce the value of the security this is known as extension risk credit risk credit risk is the risk that one or more income securities in the fund’s portfolio will decline in price or fail to pay interest or principal when due because the issuer of the security experiences a decline in its financial status the fund’s investments in income securities involve credit risk however in general lower rated lower grade and noninvestment grade income securities carry a greater degree of risk that the issuer will lose its ability to make interest and principal payments which could have a negative impact on the fund’s net asset value or dividends lower grade securities risk investing in lower grade and noninvestment grade securities involves additional risks securities of below investment grade quality are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” or “high yield securities” investment in securities of below investment grade quality involves substantial risk of loss securities of below investment grade quality are predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal when due and therefore involve a greater risk of default or decline in market value due to adverse economic and issuerspecific developments issuers of below investment grade securities are not perceived to be as strong financially as those with higher credit ratings issuers of lower grade securities may be highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing therefore the risks associated with acquiring the securities of such issuers generally are greater than is the case with higher rated securities these issuers are more vulnerable to financial setbacks and recession than more creditworthy issuers which may impair their ability to make interest and principal payments the issuers ability to service its debt obligations also may be adversely affected by specific issuer developments the issuers inability to meet specific projected business forecasts or the unavailability of additional financing therefore there can be no assurance that in the future there will not exist a higher default rate relative to the rates currently existing in the market for lower grade securities the risk of loss due to default by the issuer is significantly greater for the holders of lower grade securities because such securities may be unsecured and may be subordinate to other creditors of the issuer securities of below investment grade quality display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment the market values for securities of below investment grade quality tend to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than investment grade debt securities to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain below investment grade securities the market for them may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods debt securities risk debt securities are subject to a variety of risks such as interest rate risk income risk callprepayment risk inflation risk credit risk and in the case of foreign securities country risk and currency risk the reorganization of an issuer under the federal bankruptcy laws may result in the issuers debt securities being cancelled without repayment repaid only in part or repaid in part or in whole through an exchange thereof for any combination of cash debt securities convertible securities equity securities or other instruments or rights in respect of the same issuer or a related entity preferred securities risk there are special risks associated with investing in preferred securities including deferral preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer at its discretion to defer distributions for a stated period without any adverse consequences to the issuer if the fund owns a preferred security that is deferring its distributions the fund may be required to report income for tax purposes although it has not yet received such income noncumulative dividends some preferred stocks are noncumulative meaning that the dividends do not accumulate and need not ever be paid a portion of the portfolio may include investments in noncumulative preferred securities whereby the issuer does not have an obligation to make up any arrearages to its shareholders should an issuer of a noncumulative preferred stock held by the fund determine not to pay dividends on such stock the amount of dividends the fund pays may be adversely affected there is no assurance that dividends or distributions on noncumulative preferred stocks in which the fund invests will be declared or otherwise made payable subordination preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and liquidation payments and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than more senior debt instruments liquidity preferred securities may be substantially less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks or us government securities limited voting rights generally preferred security holders such as the fund have no voting rights with respect to the issuing company unless preferred dividends have been in arrears for a specified number of periods at which time the preferred security holders may have the right to elect a number of directors to the issuer’s board generally once all the arrearages have been paid the preferred security holders no longer have voting rights special redemption rights in certain varying circumstances an issuer of preferred securities may redeem the securities prior to a specified date for instance for certain types of preferred securities a redemption may be triggered by a change in federal income tax or securities laws as with call provisions a redemption by the issuer may negatively impact the return of the security held by the fund foreign securities risk investing in foreign issuers or securities denominated in nonus currencies may involve certain risks not typically associated with investing in securities of us issuers due to increased exposure to foreign economic political and legal developments including favorable or unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates exchange control regulations including currency blockage confiscatory taxation political or social instability illiquidity price volatility market manipulation expropriation or nationalization of assets imposition of withholding taxes on payments and possible difficulty in obtaining and enforcing judgments against foreign entities furthermore issuers of foreign securities and obligations are subject to different often less comprehensive accounting reporting and disclosure requirements than domestic issuers the securities and obligations of some foreign companies and foreign markets are less liquid and at times more volatile than comparable us securities obligations and markets securities markets in foreign countries often are not as developed efficient or liquid as securities markets in the united states and therefore the prices of foreign securities can be more volatile certain foreign countries may impose restrictions on the ability of issuers to make payments of principal and interest to investors located outside the country in the event of nationalization expropriation or other confiscation the fund could lose its entire investment in a foreign security transaction costs of investing outside the us are generally higher than in the us higher costs result because of the cost of converting a foreign currency to dollars the payment of fixed brokerage commissions on some foreign exchanges and the imposition of transfer taxes or transaction charges by foreign exchanges nonus markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures which in some markets have at times failed to keep pace with the volume of transactions thereby creating substantial delays and settlement failures that could adversely affect the funds performance foreign brokerage commissions and other fees are also generally higher than in the united states there are also special tax considerations which apply to securities and obligations of foreign issuers and securities and obligations principally traded overseas these risks may be more pronounced to the extent that the fund invests a significant amount of its assets in companies located in one country or geographic region in which case the fund may be more exposed to regional economic risks and to the extent that the fund invests in securities of issuers in emerging markets emerging markets risk investments in securities the issuers of which are located in countries considered to be emerging markets are subject to heightened risks relative to foreign investing generally and are considered speculative investing in emerging market countries involves certain risks not typically associated with investing in the united states and it imposes risks greater than or in addition to risks of investing in more developed foreign countries these risks include but are not limited to the following greater risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets or confiscatory taxation currency devaluations and other currency exchange rate fluctuations greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability including amplified risk of war and terrorism more substantial government involvement in the economy less government supervision and regulation of the securities markets and participants in those markets and possible arbitrary and unpredictable enforcement of securities regulations controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital and on the funds ability to exchange local currencies for us dollars unavailability of currencyhedging techniques in certain emerging market countries the fact that companies in emerging market countries may be smaller less seasoned or newly organized the difference in or lack of auditing and financial reporting standards which may result in unavailability of material information about issuers the risk that it may be more difficult to obtain andor enforce a judgment in a court outside the united states and greater price volatility substantially less liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization of securities markets compared to developed countries emerging market countries may have relatively unstable governments economies based on only a few industries and securities markets that trade a small number of securities securities issued by companies located in emerging market countries tend to be especially volatile and may be less liquid than securities traded in developed countries in the past securities in these countries have been characterized by greater potential loss than securities of companies located in developed countries foreign investment in certain emerging market countries may be restricted or controlled to varying degrees these restrictions or controls may at times limit or preclude foreign investment in certain emerging market issuers and increase the costs and expenses of the fund certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons in a particular issuer limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer limit the investment by foreign persons only to a specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domiciliaries of the countries andor impose additional taxes on foreign investors investments in issuers located in emerging markets pose a greater degree of systemic risk the interrelatedness of institutions within a country and among emerging market economies has increased in recent years institutional failures or economic difficulties may spread throughout a country region or emerging market countries throughout the world which may limit the ability of the fund to manage risk through geographic diversification bankruptcy law and creditor reorganization processes may differ substantially from those in the united states resulting in greater uncertainty as to the rights of creditors the enforceability of such rights reorganization timing and the classification seniority and treatment of claims foreign currency risk the fund’s investment performance may be negatively affected by a devaluation of a currency in which the fund’s investments are denominated or quoted further the fund’s investment performance may be significantly affected either positively or negatively by currency exchange rates because the us dollar value of securities denominated or quoted in another currency will increase or decrease in response to changes in the value of such currency in relation to the us dollar foreign currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for various reasons including changes in interest rates inflation balance of payments governmental surpluses or deficits intervention or nonintervention by us or foreign governments central banks or supranational entities the imposition of currency controls and political developments in the us and abroad the fund may but is not required to seek to protect itself from changes in currency exchange rates through hedging transactions depending on market conditions there can be no assurance that such strategies will be available or will be used by the fund or if used will be successful certain countries particularly emerging market countries may impose foreign currency exchange controls or other restrictions on the repatriation transferability or convertibility of currency the fund may attempt within the parameters of currency and exchange controls that may be in effect to obtain rights to exchange its invested capital dividends interest fees other distributions and capital gains into convertible currencies further the fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies foreign exchange rates have been highly volatile in recent years the combination of volatility and leverage gives rise to the possibility of large profit and large loss in addition there is counterparty risk since currency trading is done on a principal to principal basis derivatives transactions risk the fund may engage in various derivatives transactions for hedging and risk management purposes to facilitate portfolio management and to earn income or enhance total return the use of derivatives transactions to earn income or enhance total return may be particularly speculative derivative transactions entered into to seek to manage the risks of the fund’s portfolio of securities may have the effect of limiting the gains from favorable market movements losses on derivatives transactions may reduce the fund’s net asset value and its ability to pay dividends if such losses are not offset by gains on a portfolio positions being hedged derivatives transactions involve risks there may be imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets derivatives transactions may be subject to risks associated with the possible default of the other party to the transaction derivative instruments may be illiquid certain derivatives transactions may have economic characteristics similar to leverage in that relatively small market movements may result in large changes in the value of an investment certain derivatives transactions that involve leverage can result in losses that greatly exceed the amount originally invested furthermore the fund’s ability to successfully use derivatives transactions depends on the manager’s ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the use of derivatives transactions may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell derivatives transactions involve risks of mispricing or improper valuation the documentation governing a derivative instrument or transaction may be unfavorable or ambiguous derivatives transactions may involve commissions and other costs which may increase the fund’s expenses and reduce its return various legislative and regulatory initiatives may impact the availability liquidity and cost of derivative instruments limit or restrict the ability of the fund to use certain derivative instruments or transact with certain counterparties as a part of its investment strategy increase the costs of using derivative instruments or make derivative instruments less effective in connection with certain derivatives transactions the fund may be required to segregate liquid assets or otherwise cover such transactions andor to deposit amounts as premiums or to be held in margin accounts such amounts may not otherwise be available to the fund for investment purposes the fund may earn a lower return on its portfolio than it might otherwise earn if it did not have to segregate assets in respect of or otherwise cover its derivatives transactions positions to the extent the fund’s assets are segregated or committed as cover it could limit the fund’s investment flexibility segregating assets and covering positions will not limit or offset losses on related positions risk associated with covered call option writing there are significant differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events as the writer of a covered call option the fund forgoes during the option’s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline as the fund writes covered calls over more of its portfolio its ability to benefit from capital appreciation becomes more limited the value of options written by the fund will be affected by among other factors changes in the value of underlying securities including those comprising an index changes in the dividend rates of underlying securities changes in interest rates changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the stock market and underlying securities and the remaining time to an option’s expiration the value of an option also may be adversely affected if the market for the option is reduced or becomes less liquid to the extent that there is a lack of correlation between the index options written by the fund and the fund’s portfolio securities movements in the indexes underlying the options positions may result in losses to the fund which may more than offset any gains received by the fund from options premiums such sales would involve transaction costs borne by the fund and may also result in realization of taxable gains with respect to exchangetraded options there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position on an options exchange an absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange may arise because i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options iv unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange v the facilities of an exchange or the options clearing corporation the “occ” may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options if trading were discontinued the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist in the event that the fund were unable to close out a call option that it had written on a portfolio security it would not be able to sell the underlying security unless the option expired without exercise the fund’s options transactions will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities on which the options are traded these limitations govern the maximum number of options in each class which may be written or purchased by a single investor or group of investors acting in concert regardless of whether the options are written or purchased on the same or different exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities or are held or written in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers an exchange board of trade or other trading facility may order the liquidation of positions found to be in excess of these limits and it may impose other sanctions the fund may also write sell overthecounter options “otc options” options written by the fund with respect to nonus securities indices or sectors generally will be otc options otc options differ from exchangelisted options in that they are entered into directly with the buyer of the option and not through an exchange or clearing organization that is interposed between the fund and the counterparty in an otc option transaction exercise price premium and other terms are negotiated between buyer and seller otc options generally do not have as much market liquidity as exchangelisted options the otc options written by the fund will not be issued guaranteed or cleared by the occ in addition the fund’s ability to terminate the otc options may be more limited than with exchangetraded options banks brokerdealers or other financial institutions participating in such transaction may fail to settle a transaction in accordance with the terms of the option as written in the event of default or insolvency of the counterparty the fund may be unable to liquidate an otc option position counterparty risk the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts entered into by the fund if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding the fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances concerns about or a default by one large market participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants if a counterparty’s credit becomes significantly impaired multiple requests for collateral posting in a short period of time could increase the risk that the fund may not receive adequate collateral the counterparty risk for cleared derivatives is generally lower than for uncleared overthecounter derivatives transactions since generally a clearing organization becomes substituted for each counterparty to a cleared derivative contract and in effect guarantees the parties’ performance under the contract as each party to a trade looks only to the clearing organization for performance of financial obligations under the derivative contract however there can be no assurance that a clearing organization or its members will satisfy its obligations to the fund leverage risk the use of leverage may result in higher income to common shareholders over time however there can be no assurance that this expectations will be realized or that a leveraging strategy will be successful in any particular time period use of leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and capital appreciation but at the same time creates special risks leverage is a speculative technique that exposes the fund to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not implemented there can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be utilized or will be successful the use of leverage by the fund will cause the net asset value and possibly the market price of the fund’s common shares to fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates and other economic indicators as a result the net asset value and market price and dividend rate of the common shares of the fund is likely to be more volatile than those of a closedend management investment company that is not exposed to leverage in a declining market the use of leverage may result in a greater decline in the net asset value of the common shares than if the fund were not leveraged leverage will increase operating costs which may reduce total return the fund will have to pay interest on its indebtedness if any which may reduce the fund’s return this interest expense may be greater than the fund’s return on the underlying investment which would negatively affect the performance of the fund increases in interest rates that the fund must pay on its indebtedness will increase the cost of leverage and may reduce the return to common shareholders this risk may be greater in the current market environment because interest rates are near historically low levels certain types of indebtedness subject the fund to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage and portfolio composition requirements certain indebtedness issued by the fund also may be subject to certain restrictions on investments imposed by guidelines of one or more rating agencies which may issue ratings for such indebtedness these guidelines may impose asset coverage or portfolio composition requirements that are more stringent than those imposed by the  act reverse repurchase agreements involve the risks that the interest income earned on the investment of the proceeds will be less than the interest expense and fund expenses associated with the repurchase agreement that the market value of the securities sold by the fund may decline below the price at which the fund is obligated to repurchase such securities and that the securities may not be returned to the fund there is no assurance that reverse repurchase agreements can be successfully employed in connection with reverse repurchase agreements the fund will also be subject to counterparty risk with respect to the purchaser of the securities if the brokerdealer to whom the fund sells securities becomes insolvent the fund’s right to purchase or repurchase securities may be restricted the fund may have leverage outstanding during a shorterterm period during which such leverage may not be beneficial to the fund if the fund believes that the longterm benefits to common shareholders of such leverage would outweigh the costs and portfolio disruptions associated with redeeming and reissuing such leverage however there can be no assurance that the fund’s judgment in weighing such costs and benefits will be correct during the time in which the fund is utilizing leverage the amount of the fees paid for investment advisory services will be higher than if the fund did not utilize leverage because the fees paid will be calculated based on the fund’s managed assets including proceeds of leverage this may create a conflict of interest between the manager and the common shareholders as common shareholders bear the portion of the investment advisory fee attributable to the assets purchased with the proceeds of leverage which means that common shareholders effectively bear the entire advisory fee in addition the fund may engage in certain derivatives transactions that have economic characteristics similar to leverage the fund intends to earmark or segregate cash or liquid securities or otherwise cover such transactions in accordance with applicable interpretations of the staff of the sec securities so segregated or designated as “cover” will be unavailable for sale unless replaced by other securities qualifying for segregation or cover requirements which may adversely affect the ability of the fund to pursue its investment objective illiquid investments risk illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the fund believes it is desirable to do so the market price of illiquid securities generally is more volatile than that of more liquid securities which may adversely affect the price that the fund pays for or recovers upon the sale of illiquid securities illiquid securities are also more difficult to value and the manager’s judgment may play a greater role in the valuation process investment of the fund’s assets in illiquid securities may restrict the fund’s ability to take advantage of market opportunities the risks associated with illiquid securities may be particularly acute in situations in which the fund’s operations require cash and could result in the fund borrowing to meet its shortterm needs or incurring losses on the sale of illiquid securities although many of the rule a securities in which the fund invests may be in the view of the manager liquid if qualified institutional buyers are unwilling to purchase these rule a securities they may become illiquid smaller company risk the general risks associated with corporate incomeproducing and equity securities are particularly pronounced for securities issued by companies with smaller market capitalizations these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources or they may depend on a few key employees as a result they may be subject to greater levels of credit market and issuer risk securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in lesser volume than more widely held securities and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities companies with mediumsized market capitalizations may have risks similar to those of smaller companies reit risk to the extent that the fund invests in reits it will be subject to the risks associated with owning real estate and with the real estate industry generally reits are subject to interest rate risks especially mortgage reits and the risk of default by lessees or borrowers an equity reit may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying properties owned by the reit a mortgage reit may be affected by the ability of the issuers of its portfolio mortgages to repay their obligations reits whose underlying assets are concentrated in properties used by a particular industry are also subject to risks associated with such industry reits may have limited financial resources their securities trade less frequently and in a limited volume and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities inflation riskdeflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline in addition during any periods of rising inflation the dividend rates or borrowing costs associated with the fund’s use of leverage would likely increase which would tend to further reduce returns to common shareholders deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time—the opposite of inflation deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely which may result in a decline in the value of the fund’s portfolio securities lending risk the fund may also lend the securities it owns to others which allows the fund the opportunity to earn additional income although the fund will require the borrower of the securities to post collateral for the loan and the terms of the loan will require that the fund be able to reacquire the loaned securities if certain events occur the fund is still subject to the risk that the borrower of the securities may default which could result in the fund losing money which would result in a decline in the fund’s net asset value the fund may also purchase securities for delayed settlement this means that the fund is generally obligated to purchase the securities at a future date for a set purchase price regardless of whether the value of the securities is more or less than the purchase price at the time of settlement management risk management’s judgment about the attractiveness relative value or potential appreciation of a particular sector security or investment strategy may prove to be incorrect and there can be no assurance that the investment decisions made will prove beneficial to the fund legislation and regulation risk legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect the assets of the fund or the issuers of such assets changing approaches to regulation may have a negative impact on the fund or entities in which the fund invests legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the fund itself is regulated there can be no assurance that future legislation regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on the fund or will not impair the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective portfolio turnover risk the fund’s annual portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year portfolio turnover rate is not considered a limiting factor in the execution of investment decisions for the fund a higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the fund high portfolio turnover may result in an increased realization of net shortterm capital gains by the fund which when distributed to common shareholders will be taxable as ordinary income additionally in a declining market portfolio turnover may result in realized capital losses subscribe to our perspectives your browser does
