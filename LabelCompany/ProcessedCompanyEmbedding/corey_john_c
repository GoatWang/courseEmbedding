biographyedit ej corey the surname was anglicized from the lebanese arabic khoury meaning priest was born to christian lebanese immigrants in methuen massachusetts  km  mi north of boston his mother changed his name to elias to honor his father who died eighteen months after coreys birth his widowed mother brother two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house struggling through the great depression as a young boy corey was rather independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball football and hiking he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence massachusetts at the age of  corey entered mit where he earned both a bachelors degree in  and a phd under professor john c sheehan in  upon entering mit coreys only experience with science was in mathematics and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his longterm career plans and graduated with a bachelors degree in chemistry immediately thereafter at the invitation of professor john c sheehan corey remained at mit for his phd after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign where he became a full professor of chemistry in  at the age of  he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in  in  he moved to harvard university where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health he has also been an advisor to pfizer for more than  years among numerous honors corey was awarded the national medal of science in  the nobel prize in chemistry in  and the american chemical societys greatest honor the priestley medal in  major contributionsedit reagentsedit ej corey has developed several new synthetic reagents pcc pyridinium chlorochromate also referred to as the coreysuggs reagent is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes pcc has several advantages over other commercial oxidants one of these advantages is that the compound is available as an airstable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic unlike other oxidizing agents pcc can accomplish single oxidations with only about  equivalents scheme  the alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium vi metal displacing chlorine the chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium iv the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes scheme  the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene after elimination and further oxidation the product is a cyclic ketone if this product is undesired powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis scheme  this example illustrates that pcc is capable of performing a dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a sigmatropic rearrangement tbutyldimethylsilyl ether tbs triisopropylsilyl ether tips and methoxyethoxymethyl mem are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since  the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group tbs is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions more importantly tbs ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as grignard reagents and enolates in the field of complex molecule synthesis tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the siliconbased protecting groups scheme  the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers other means of tbs deprotection include acids also lewis acids and fluorides tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether but longer reaction times are generally needed usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf but the hindered tbs ether below survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal scheme  the mem protecting group was first described by corey in  this protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage scheme  dithianes were pioneered by ej corey in  as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a lewis acid scheme  or directly from carbonyl compounds the pka of dithianes is approximately  allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent typically nbutyllithium the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the coreyseebach reaction the dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming electrophiles after deprotection of the dithiane usually with hgo a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis scheme  dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene methodologyedit several reactions developed in coreys lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least  methods have been developed in the corey group since  several reactions have been named after him coreyitsuno reduction also known as the coreybakshishibata reduction is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst scheme  later corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable the reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at nitrogen coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complexscheme  lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity allowing coordination with the ketone substrate the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the bo bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a membered ring transition state leading to a fourmembered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists scheme  the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and coworkers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a boranedimethylsulfide complex coreyfuchs alkyne synthesis is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a onecarbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide reacting the phosphorus ylide with the aldehyde substrate yields a dibromoolefin on treatment with two equivalents of nbuli lithium halogen exchange and deprotonation yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product scheme  more recently a onepot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis taylorione by wj kerr and coworkers scheme  the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones this process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations with the use of nchlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride ncs dimethylsulfide dms and triethylamine tea the coreykim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species scheme  the alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product the reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility in the total synthesis of ingenol kuwajima and coworkers exploited the coreykim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcoholscheme  coreywinter olefination is a stereospecific transformation of diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate thiocarbonyldiimidazole and excess trialkylphosphite the mechanism has been narrowed down to two possible pathways but the exact mechanism is unknown specifically the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate nonetheless the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain more importantly stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates professor tkm shing et al used the coreywinter olefination reaction to synthesize boesenoxide scheme  cbs enantioselective dielsalder reaction has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective cbs reduction after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized membered ring pretransition state to deliver highly enantioenriched products scheme  this transition state likely occurs because of favorable pistacking with the phenyl substituent the enantioselectivity of the process is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent the dielsalder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the dielsalder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of sixmembered ringsscheme  coreynicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones previously intermolecular outcompeted intramolecular lactonization even at low concentrations one big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and baselabile functional groups to date rings of  to  members have been successfully synthesized using this method the reaction occurs in the presence of dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine the reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene the mechanism begins with formation of the pyridinethiol ester scheme  protontransfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone scheme  johnsoncoreychaykovsky reaction is useful for the synthesis of epoxides and cyclopropanes the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones ketones aldehydes and imines to form corresponding epoxides cyclopropanes and aziridines two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products scheme the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide provides epoxides from ketones but yields the cyclopropanes when enones are employed dimethylsulfonium methylide transforms ketones and enones to the corresponding epoxides dimethylsulfonium methylide is much more reactive and less stable than dimethylsulfoxonium methylide so it is generated at low temperatures based on their reactivity another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity the reaction is very well established and enantioselective variants catalytic and stoichiometric have also been achieved from a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes scheme  danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol diastereoselectivity is established by  interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure total synthesesedit e j corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses at least  molecules have been synthesized in the corey group since  his  total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics specifically the synthesis of prostaglandin fa presents several challenges the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable topological challenge for organic chemist coreys retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors scheme  molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a wittig reaction and hornerwadsworth emmons modification the wittig reaction affords the cis product while the hornerwadsworth emmons produces the trans olefin the published synthesis reveals a  diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride however years later corey and coworkers established the cbs reduction one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a  mixture of the desired diastereomer scheme  the iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key baeyervilliger intermediate this oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electronrich site the pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the dielsalder structural goal which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring later corey developed an asymmetric dielsalder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins other

altom suicideedit main article jason altom among the hundreds of graduatestudents supervised by prof corey was jason altom altoms suicide caused controversy because he explicitly blamed corey his research advisor for his suicide corey was devastated and bewildered by altoms death altom cited in his  farewell note abusive research supervisors as one reason for taking his life altoms suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors corey is quoted as stating that letter doesnt make sense at the end jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme corey also is on record as stating that he never questioned mr altoms intellectual contributions i did my best to guide jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain i did my best every step of the way corey states my conscience is clear everything jason did came out of our partnership we never had the slightest disagreement as a result of altoms death the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis the american foundation for suicide prevention afsp cited the new york times article on altoms suicide as an example of problematic reporting and suggested that corey was unfairly scapegoated according to the boston globe altoms suicide note indicated fear that his career hopes were doomed but the globe also cited students and professors as saying that altom actually retained coreys support before altom two of coreys other graduate students had committed suicide corey group membersedit as of  approximately  people have been corey group members a database of  former members and their current affiliation was developed for coreys th birthday in july  woodward–hoffmann rulesedit when awarded the priestley medal in  e j corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired robert burns woodward prior to the development of the woodward–hoffmann rules corey wrote on may   i suggested to my colleague r b woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed homo molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → butadiene and hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules this was coreys first public statement on his claim that starting on may   woodward put forth coreys explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may  corey had discussed his claim privately with hoffmann and close colleagues since  corey mentions that he made the priestley statement so the historical record would be correct coreys claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by roald hoffmann in the journal angewandte chemie in the rebuttal hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt harvard and that he would not consider doing anything against harvard to which i was and am so devoted corey also hoped that woodward himself would correct the historical record as he grew older more considerate and more sensitive to his own conscience woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in  awards and honorsedit ej corey has received more than  major awards including the linus pauling award  franklin medal  tetrahedron prize  wolf prize in chemistry

prize in chemistry for his development of the theory and methodology of organic synthesis specifically retrosynthetic analysis regarded by many as one of the greatest living chemists he has developed numerous synthetic reagents methodologies and total syntheses and has advanced the science of organic synthesis considerably contents  biography  major contributions  reagents  methodology  total syntheses  publications  altom suicide  corey group members  woodward–hoffmann rules  awards and honors  references  external links biographyedit ej corey the surname was anglicized from the lebanese arabic khoury meaning priest was born to christian lebanese immigrants in methuen massachusetts  km  mi north of boston his mother changed his name to elias to honor his father who died eighteen months after coreys birth his widowed mother brother two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house struggling through the great depression as a young boy corey was rather independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball football and hiking he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence massachusetts at the age of  corey entered mit where he earned both a bachelors degree in  and a phd under professor john c sheehan in  upon entering mit coreys only experience with science was in mathematics and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his longterm career plans and graduated with a bachelors degree in chemistry immediately thereafter at the invitation of professor john c sheehan corey remained at mit for his phd after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign where he became a full professor of chemistry in  at the age of  he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in  in  he moved to harvard university where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health he has also been an advisor to pfizer for more than  years among numerous honors corey was awarded the national medal of science in  the nobel prize in chemistry in  and the american chemical societys greatest honor the priestley medal in  major contributionsedit reagentsedit ej corey has developed several new synthetic reagents pcc pyridinium chlorochromate also referred to as the coreysuggs reagent is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes pcc has several advantages over other commercial oxidants one of these advantages is that the compound is available as an airstable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic unlike other oxidizing agents pcc can accomplish single oxidations with only about  equivalents scheme  the alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium vi metal displacing chlorine the chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium iv the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes scheme  the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene after elimination and further oxidation the product is a cyclic ketone if this product is undesired powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis scheme  this example illustrates that pcc is capable of performing a dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a sigmatropic rearrangement tbutyldimethylsilyl ether tbs triisopropylsilyl ether tips and methoxyethoxymethyl mem are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since  the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group tbs is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions more importantly tbs ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as grignard reagents and enolates in the field of complex molecule synthesis tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the siliconbased protecting groups scheme  the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers other means of tbs deprotection include acids also lewis acids and fluorides tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether but longer reaction times are generally needed usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf but the hindered tbs ether below survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal scheme  the mem protecting group was first described by corey in  this protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage scheme  dithianes were pioneered by ej corey in  as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a lewis acid scheme  or directly from carbonyl compounds the pka of dithianes is approximately  allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent typically nbutyllithium the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the coreyseebach reaction the dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming electrophiles after deprotection of the dithiane usually with hgo a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis scheme  dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene methodologyedit several reactions developed in coreys lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least  methods have been developed in the corey group since  several reactions have been named after him coreyitsuno reduction also known as the coreybakshishibata reduction is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst scheme  later corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable the reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at nitrogen coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complexscheme  lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity allowing coordination with the ketone substrate the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the bo bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a membered ring transition state leading to a fourmembered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists scheme  the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and coworkers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a boranedimethylsulfide complex coreyfuchs alkyne synthesis is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a onecarbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide reacting the phosphorus ylide with the aldehyde substrate yields a dibromoolefin on treatment with two equivalents of nbuli lithium halogen exchange and deprotonation yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product scheme  more recently a onepot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis taylorione by wj kerr and coworkers scheme  the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones this process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations with the use of nchlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride ncs dimethylsulfide dms and triethylamine tea the coreykim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species scheme  the alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product the reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility in the total synthesis of ingenol kuwajima and coworkers exploited the coreykim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcoholscheme  coreywinter olefination is a stereospecific transformation of diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate thiocarbonyldiimidazole and excess trialkylphosphite the mechanism has been narrowed down to two possible pathways but the exact mechanism is unknown specifically the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate nonetheless the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain more importantly stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates professor tkm shing et al used the coreywinter olefination reaction to synthesize boesenoxide scheme  cbs enantioselective dielsalder reaction has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective cbs reduction after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized membered ring pretransition state to deliver highly enantioenriched products scheme  this transition state likely occurs because of favorable pistacking with the phenyl substituent the enantioselectivity of the process is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent the dielsalder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the dielsalder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of sixmembered ringsscheme  coreynicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones previously intermolecular outcompeted intramolecular lactonization even at low concentrations one big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and baselabile functional groups to date rings of  to  members have been successfully synthesized using this method the reaction occurs in the presence of dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine the reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene the mechanism begins with formation of the pyridinethiol ester scheme  protontransfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone scheme  johnsoncoreychaykovsky reaction is useful for the synthesis of epoxides and cyclopropanes the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones ketones aldehydes and imines to form corresponding epoxides cyclopropanes and aziridines two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products scheme the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide provides epoxides from ketones but yields the cyclopropanes when enones are employed dimethylsulfonium methylide transforms ketones and enones to the corresponding epoxides dimethylsulfonium methylide is much more reactive and less stable than dimethylsulfoxonium methylide so it is generated at low temperatures based on their reactivity another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity the reaction is very well established and enantioselective variants catalytic and stoichiometric have also been achieved from a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes scheme  danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol diastereoselectivity is established by  interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure total synthesesedit e j corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses at least  molecules have been synthesized in the corey group since  his  total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics specifically the synthesis of prostaglandin fa presents several challenges the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable topological challenge for organic chemist coreys retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors scheme  molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a wittig reaction and hornerwadsworth emmons modification the wittig reaction affords the cis product while the hornerwadsworth emmons produces the trans olefin the published synthesis reveals a  diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride however years later corey and coworkers established the cbs reduction one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a  mixture of the desired diastereomer scheme  the iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key baeyervilliger intermediate this oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electronrich site the pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the dielsalder structural goal which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring later corey developed an asymmetric dielsalder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins other notable syntheses longifolene ginkgolides a and b lactacystin miroestrol ecteinascidin

altom cited in his  farewell note abusive research supervisors as one reason for taking his life altoms suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors corey is quoted as stating that letter doesnt make sense at the end jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme corey also is on record as stating that he never questioned mr altoms intellectual contributions i did my best to guide jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain i did my best every step of the way corey states my conscience is clear everything jason did came out of our partnership we never had the slightest disagreement as a result of altoms death the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis the american foundation for suicide prevention afsp cited the new york times article on altoms suicide as an example of problematic reporting and suggested that corey was unfairly scapegoated according to the boston globe altoms suicide note indicated fear that his career hopes were doomed but the globe also cited students and professors as saying that altom actually retained coreys support before altom two of coreys other graduate students had committed suicide corey group membersedit as of  approximately  people have been corey group members a database of  former members and their current affiliation was developed for coreys th birthday in july  woodward–hoffmann rulesedit when awarded the priestley medal in  e j corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired robert burns woodward prior to the development of the woodward–hoffmann rules corey wrote on may   i suggested to my colleague r b woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed homo molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → butadiene and hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules this was coreys first public statement on his claim that starting on may   woodward put forth coreys explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may  corey had discussed his claim privately with hoffmann and close colleagues since  corey mentions that he made the priestley statement so the historical record would be correct coreys claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by roald hoffmann in the journal angewandte chemie in the rebuttal hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt harvard and that he would not consider doing anything against harvard to which i was and am so devoted corey also hoped that woodward himself would correct the historical record as he grew older more considerate and more sensitive to his own conscience woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in  awards and honorsedit ej corey has received more

prize in chemistry for his development of the theory and methodology of organic synthesis specifically retrosynthetic analysis regarded by many as one of the greatest living chemists he has developed numerous synthetic reagents methodologies and total syntheses and has advanced the science of organic synthesis considerably contents  biography  major contributions  reagents  methodology  total syntheses  publications  altom suicide  corey group members  woodward–hoffmann rules  awards and honors  references  external links biographyedit ej corey the surname was anglicized from the lebanese arabic khoury meaning priest was born to christian lebanese immigrants in methuen massachusetts  km  mi north of boston his mother changed his name to elias to honor his father who died eighteen months after coreys birth his widowed mother brother two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house struggling through the great depression as a young boy corey was rather independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball football and hiking he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence massachusetts at the age of  corey entered mit where he earned both a bachelors degree in  and a phd under professor john c sheehan in  upon entering mit coreys only experience with science was in mathematics and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his longterm career plans and graduated with a bachelors degree in chemistry immediately thereafter at the invitation of professor john c sheehan corey remained at mit for his phd after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign where he became a full professor of chemistry in  at the age of  he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in  in  he moved to harvard university where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health he has also been an advisor to pfizer for more than  years among numerous honors corey was awarded the national medal of science in  the nobel prize in chemistry in  and the american chemical societys greatest honor the priestley medal in  major contributionsedit reagentsedit ej corey has developed several new synthetic reagents pcc pyridinium chlorochromate also referred to as the coreysuggs reagent is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes pcc has several advantages over other commercial oxidants one of these advantages is that the compound is available as an airstable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic unlike other oxidizing agents pcc can accomplish single oxidations with only about  equivalents scheme  the alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium vi metal displacing chlorine the chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium iv the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes scheme  the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene after elimination and further oxidation the product is a cyclic ketone if this product is undesired powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis scheme  this example illustrates that pcc is capable of performing a dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a sigmatropic rearrangement tbutyldimethylsilyl ether tbs triisopropylsilyl ether tips and methoxyethoxymethyl mem are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since  the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group tbs is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions more importantly tbs ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as grignard reagents and enolates in the field of complex molecule synthesis tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the siliconbased protecting groups scheme  the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers other means of tbs deprotection include acids also lewis acids and fluorides tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether but longer reaction times are generally needed usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf but the hindered tbs ether below survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal scheme  the mem protecting group was first described by corey in  this protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage scheme  dithianes were pioneered by ej corey in  as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a lewis acid scheme  or directly from carbonyl compounds the pka of dithianes is approximately  allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent typically nbutyllithium the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the coreyseebach reaction the dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming electrophiles after deprotection of the dithiane usually with hgo a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis scheme  dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene methodologyedit several reactions developed in coreys lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least  methods have been developed in the corey group since  several reactions have been named after him coreyitsuno reduction also known as the coreybakshishibata reduction is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst scheme  later corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable the reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at nitrogen coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complexscheme  lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity allowing coordination with the ketone substrate the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the bo bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a membered ring transition state leading to a fourmembered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists scheme  the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and coworkers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a boranedimethylsulfide complex coreyfuchs alkyne synthesis is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a onecarbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide reacting the phosphorus ylide with the aldehyde substrate yields a dibromoolefin on treatment with two equivalents of nbuli lithium halogen exchange and deprotonation yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product scheme  more recently a onepot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis taylorione by wj kerr and coworkers scheme  the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones this process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations with the use of nchlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride ncs dimethylsulfide dms and triethylamine tea the coreykim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species scheme  the alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product the reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility in the total synthesis of ingenol kuwajima and coworkers exploited the coreykim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcoholscheme  coreywinter olefination is a stereospecific transformation of diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate thiocarbonyldiimidazole and excess trialkylphosphite the mechanism has been narrowed down to two possible pathways but the exact mechanism is unknown specifically the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate nonetheless the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain more importantly stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates professor tkm shing et al used the coreywinter olefination reaction to synthesize boesenoxide scheme  cbs enantioselective dielsalder reaction has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective cbs reduction after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized membered ring pretransition state to deliver highly enantioenriched products scheme  this transition state likely occurs because of favorable pistacking with the phenyl substituent the enantioselectivity of the process is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent the dielsalder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the dielsalder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of sixmembered ringsscheme  coreynicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones previously intermolecular outcompeted intramolecular lactonization even at low concentrations one big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and baselabile functional groups to date rings of  to  members have been successfully synthesized using this method the reaction occurs in the presence of dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine the reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene the mechanism begins with formation of the pyridinethiol ester scheme  protontransfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone scheme  johnsoncoreychaykovsky reaction is useful for the synthesis of epoxides and cyclopropanes the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones ketones aldehydes and imines to form corresponding epoxides cyclopropanes and aziridines two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products scheme the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide provides epoxides from ketones but yields the cyclopropanes when enones are employed dimethylsulfonium methylide transforms ketones and enones to the corresponding epoxides dimethylsulfonium methylide is much more reactive and less stable than dimethylsulfoxonium methylide so it is generated at low temperatures based on their reactivity another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity the reaction is very well established and enantioselective variants catalytic and stoichiometric have also been achieved from a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes scheme  danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol diastereoselectivity is established by  interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure total synthesesedit e j corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses at least  molecules have been synthesized in the corey group since  his  total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics specifically the synthesis of prostaglandin fa presents several challenges the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable topological challenge for organic chemist coreys retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors scheme  molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a wittig reaction and hornerwadsworth emmons modification the wittig reaction affords the cis product while the hornerwadsworth emmons produces the trans olefin the published synthesis reveals a  diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride however years later corey and coworkers established the cbs reduction one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a  mixture of the desired diastereomer scheme  the iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key baeyervilliger intermediate this oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electronrich site the pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the dielsalder structural goal which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring later corey developed an asymmetric dielsalder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins other notable syntheses longifolene ginkgolides a and b lactacystin miroestrol ecteinascidin

supervised by prof corey was jason altom altoms suicide caused controversy because he explicitly blamed corey his research advisor for his suicide corey was devastated and bewildered by altoms death altom cited in his  farewell note abusive research supervisors as one reason for taking his life altoms suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors corey is quoted as stating that letter doesnt make sense at the end jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme corey also is on record as stating that he never questioned mr altoms intellectual contributions i did my best to guide jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain i did my best every step of the way corey states my conscience is clear everything jason did came out of our partnership we never had the slightest disagreement as a result of altoms death the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis the american foundation for suicide prevention afsp cited the new york times article on altoms suicide as an example of problematic reporting and suggested that corey was unfairly scapegoated according to the boston globe altoms suicide note indicated fear that his career hopes were doomed but the globe also cited students and professors as saying that altom actually retained coreys support before altom two of coreys other graduate students had committed suicide corey group membersedit as of  approximately  people have been corey group members a database of  former members and their current affiliation was developed for coreys th birthday in july  woodward–hoffmann rulesedit when awarded the priestley medal in  e j corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired robert burns woodward prior to the development of the woodward–hoffmann rules corey wrote on may   i suggested to my colleague r b woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed homo molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → butadiene and hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules this was coreys first public statement on his claim that starting on may   woodward put forth coreys explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may  corey had discussed his claim privately with hoffmann and close colleagues since  corey mentions that he made the priestley statement so the historical record would be correct coreys claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by roald hoffmann in the journal angewandte chemie in the rebuttal hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt harvard and that he would not consider doing anything against harvard to which i was and am so devoted corey also hoped that woodward himself would correct the historical record as he grew older more considerate and more sensitive to his own conscience woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in  awards and honorsedit ej corey has received more

prize in chemistry for his development of the theory and methodology of organic synthesis specifically retrosynthetic analysis regarded by many as one of the greatest living chemists he has developed numerous synthetic reagents methodologies and total syntheses and has advanced the science of organic synthesis considerably contents  biography  major contributions  reagents  methodology  total syntheses  publications  altom suicide  corey group members  woodward–hoffmann rules  awards and honors  references  external links biographyedit ej corey the surname was anglicized from the lebanese arabic khoury meaning priest was born to christian lebanese immigrants in methuen massachusetts  km  mi north of boston his mother changed his name to elias to honor his father who died eighteen months after coreys birth his widowed mother brother two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house struggling through the great depression as a young boy corey was rather independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball football and hiking he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence massachusetts at the age of  corey entered mit where he earned both a bachelors degree in  and a phd under professor john c sheehan in  upon entering mit coreys only experience with science was in mathematics and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his longterm career plans and graduated with a bachelors degree in chemistry immediately thereafter at the invitation of professor john c sheehan corey remained at mit for his phd after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign where he became a full professor of chemistry in  at the age of  he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in  in  he moved to harvard university where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health he has also been an advisor to pfizer for more than  years among numerous honors corey was awarded the national medal of science in  the nobel prize in chemistry in  and the american chemical societys greatest honor the priestley medal in  major contributionsedit reagentsedit ej corey has developed several new synthetic reagents pcc pyridinium chlorochromate also referred to as the coreysuggs reagent is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes pcc has several advantages over other commercial oxidants one of these advantages is that the compound is available as an airstable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic unlike other oxidizing agents pcc can accomplish single oxidations with only about  equivalents scheme  the alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium vi metal displacing chlorine the chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium iv the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes scheme  the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene after elimination and further oxidation the product is a cyclic ketone if this product is undesired powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis scheme  this example illustrates that pcc is capable of performing a dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a sigmatropic rearrangement tbutyldimethylsilyl ether tbs triisopropylsilyl ether tips and methoxyethoxymethyl mem are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since  the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group tbs is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions more importantly tbs ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as grignard reagents and enolates in the field of complex molecule synthesis tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the siliconbased protecting groups scheme  the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers other means of tbs deprotection include acids also lewis acids and fluorides tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether but longer reaction times are generally needed usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf but the hindered tbs ether below survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal scheme  the mem protecting group was first described by corey in  this protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage scheme  dithianes were pioneered by ej corey in  as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a lewis acid scheme  or directly from carbonyl compounds the pka of dithianes is approximately  allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent typically nbutyllithium the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the coreyseebach reaction the dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming electrophiles after deprotection of the dithiane usually with hgo a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis scheme  dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene methodologyedit several reactions developed in coreys lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least  methods have been developed in the corey group since  several reactions have been named after him coreyitsuno reduction also known as the coreybakshishibata reduction is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst scheme  later corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable the reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at nitrogen coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complexscheme  lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity allowing coordination with the ketone substrate the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the bo bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a membered ring transition state leading to a fourmembered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists scheme  the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and coworkers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a boranedimethylsulfide complex coreyfuchs alkyne synthesis is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a onecarbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide reacting the phosphorus ylide with the aldehyde substrate yields a dibromoolefin on treatment with two equivalents of nbuli lithium halogen exchange and deprotonation yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product scheme  more recently a onepot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis taylorione by wj kerr and coworkers scheme  the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones this process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations with the use of nchlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride ncs dimethylsulfide dms and triethylamine tea the coreykim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species scheme  the alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product the reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility in the total synthesis of ingenol kuwajima and coworkers exploited the coreykim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcoholscheme  coreywinter olefination is a stereospecific transformation of diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate thiocarbonyldiimidazole and excess trialkylphosphite the mechanism has been narrowed down to two possible pathways but the exact mechanism is unknown specifically the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate nonetheless the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain more importantly stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates professor tkm shing et al used the coreywinter olefination reaction to synthesize boesenoxide scheme  cbs enantioselective dielsalder reaction has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective cbs reduction after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized membered ring pretransition state to deliver highly enantioenriched products scheme  this transition state likely occurs because of favorable pistacking with the phenyl substituent the enantioselectivity of the process is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent the dielsalder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the dielsalder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of sixmembered ringsscheme  coreynicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones previously intermolecular outcompeted intramolecular lactonization even at low concentrations one big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and baselabile functional groups to date rings of  to  members have been successfully synthesized using this method the reaction occurs in the presence of dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine the reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene the mechanism begins with formation of the pyridinethiol ester scheme  protontransfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone scheme  johnsoncoreychaykovsky reaction is useful for the synthesis of epoxides and cyclopropanes the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones ketones aldehydes and imines to form corresponding epoxides cyclopropanes and aziridines two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products scheme the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide provides epoxides from ketones but yields the cyclopropanes when enones are employed dimethylsulfonium methylide transforms ketones and enones to the corresponding epoxides dimethylsulfonium methylide is much more reactive and less stable than dimethylsulfoxonium methylide so it is generated at low temperatures based on their reactivity another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity the reaction is very well established and enantioselective variants catalytic and stoichiometric have also been achieved from a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes scheme  danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol diastereoselectivity is established by  interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure total synthesesedit e j corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses at least  molecules have been synthesized in the corey group since  his  total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics specifically the synthesis of prostaglandin fa presents several challenges the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable topological challenge for organic chemist coreys retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors scheme  molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a wittig reaction and hornerwadsworth emmons modification the wittig reaction affords the cis product while the hornerwadsworth emmons produces the trans olefin the published synthesis reveals a  diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride however years later corey and coworkers established the cbs reduction one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a  mixture of the desired diastereomer scheme  the iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key baeyervilliger intermediate this oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electronrich site the pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the dielsalder structural goal which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring later corey developed an asymmetric dielsalder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins other notable syntheses longifolene ginkgolides a and b lactacystin miroestrol ecteinascidin

supervised by prof corey was jason altom altoms suicide caused controversy because he explicitly blamed corey his research advisor for his suicide corey was devastated and bewildered by altoms death altom cited in his  farewell note abusive research supervisors as one reason for taking his life altoms suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors corey is quoted as stating that letter doesnt make sense at the end jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme corey also is on record as stating that he never questioned mr altoms intellectual contributions i did my best to guide jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain i did my best every step of the way corey states my conscience is clear everything jason did came out of our partnership we never had the slightest disagreement as a result of altoms death the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis the american foundation for suicide prevention afsp cited the new york times article on altoms suicide as an example of problematic reporting and suggested that corey was unfairly scapegoated according to the boston globe altoms suicide note indicated fear that his career hopes were doomed but the globe also cited students and professors as saying that altom actually retained coreys support before altom two of coreys other graduate students had committed suicide corey group membersedit as of  approximately  people have been corey group members a database of  former members and their current affiliation was developed for coreys th birthday in july  woodward–hoffmann rulesedit when awarded the priestley medal in  e j corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired robert burns woodward prior to the development of the woodward–hoffmann rules corey wrote on may   i suggested to my colleague r b woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed homo molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → butadiene and hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules this was coreys first public statement on his claim that starting on may   woodward put forth coreys explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may  corey had discussed his claim privately with hoffmann and close colleagues since  corey mentions that he made the priestley statement so the historical record would be correct coreys claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by roald hoffmann in the journal angewandte chemie in the rebuttal hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt harvard and that he would not consider doing anything against harvard to which i was and am so devoted corey also hoped that woodward himself would correct the historical record as he grew older more considerate and more sensitive to his own conscience woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in  awards and honorsedit ej corey has received more

numerous synthetic reagents methodologies and total syntheses and has advanced the science of organic synthesis considerably contents  biography  major contributions  reagents  methodology  total syntheses  publications  altom suicide  corey group members  woodward–hoffmann rules  awards and honors  references  external links biographyedit ej corey the surname was anglicized from the lebanese arabic khoury meaning priest was born to christian lebanese immigrants in methuen massachusetts  km  mi north of boston his mother changed his name to elias to honor his father who died eighteen months after coreys birth his widowed mother brother two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house struggling through the great depression as a young boy corey was rather independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball football and hiking he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence massachusetts at the age of  corey entered mit where he earned both a bachelors degree in  and a phd under professor john c sheehan in  upon entering mit coreys only experience with science was in mathematics and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his longterm career plans and graduated with a bachelors degree in chemistry immediately thereafter at the invitation of professor john c sheehan corey remained at mit for his phd after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign where he became a full professor of chemistry in  at the age of  he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in  in  he moved to harvard university where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health he has also been an advisor to pfizer for more than  years among numerous honors corey was awarded the national medal of science in  the nobel prize in chemistry in  and the american chemical societys greatest honor the priestley medal in  major contributionsedit reagentsedit ej corey has developed several new synthetic reagents pcc pyridinium chlorochromate also referred to as the coreysuggs reagent is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes pcc has several advantages over other commercial oxidants one of these advantages is that the compound is available as an airstable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic unlike other oxidizing agents pcc can accomplish single oxidations with only about  equivalents scheme  the alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium vi metal displacing chlorine the chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium iv the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes scheme  the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene after elimination and further oxidation the product is a cyclic ketone if this product is undesired powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis scheme  this example illustrates that pcc is capable of performing a dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a sigmatropic rearrangement tbutyldimethylsilyl ether tbs triisopropylsilyl ether tips and methoxyethoxymethyl mem are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since  the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group tbs is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions more importantly tbs ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as grignard reagents and enolates in the field of complex molecule synthesis tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the siliconbased protecting groups scheme  the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers other means of tbs deprotection include acids also lewis acids and fluorides tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether but longer reaction times are generally needed usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf but the hindered tbs ether below survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal scheme  the mem protecting group was first described by corey in  this protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage scheme  dithianes were pioneered by ej corey in  as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a lewis acid scheme  or directly from carbonyl compounds the pka of dithianes is approximately  allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent typically nbutyllithium the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the coreyseebach reaction the dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming electrophiles after deprotection of the dithiane usually with hgo a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis scheme  dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene methodologyedit several reactions developed in coreys lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least  methods have been developed in the corey group since  several reactions have been named after him coreyitsuno reduction also known as the coreybakshishibata reduction is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst scheme  later corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable the reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at nitrogen coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complexscheme  lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity allowing coordination with the ketone substrate the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the bo bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a membered ring transition state leading to a fourmembered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists scheme  the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and coworkers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a boranedimethylsulfide complex coreyfuchs alkyne synthesis is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a onecarbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide reacting the phosphorus ylide with the aldehyde substrate yields a dibromoolefin on treatment with two equivalents of nbuli lithium halogen exchange and deprotonation yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product scheme  more recently a onepot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis taylorione by wj kerr and coworkers scheme  the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones this process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations with the use of nchlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride ncs dimethylsulfide dms and triethylamine tea the coreykim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species scheme  the alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product the reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility in the total synthesis of ingenol kuwajima and coworkers exploited the coreykim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcoholscheme  coreywinter olefination is a stereospecific transformation of diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate thiocarbonyldiimidazole and excess trialkylphosphite the mechanism has been narrowed down to two possible pathways but the exact mechanism is unknown specifically the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate nonetheless the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain more importantly stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates professor tkm shing et al used the coreywinter olefination reaction to synthesize boesenoxide scheme  cbs enantioselective dielsalder reaction has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective cbs reduction after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized membered ring pretransition state to deliver highly enantioenriched products scheme  this transition state likely occurs because of favorable pistacking with the phenyl substituent the enantioselectivity of the process is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent the dielsalder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the dielsalder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of sixmembered ringsscheme  coreynicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones previously intermolecular outcompeted intramolecular lactonization even at low concentrations one big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and baselabile functional groups to date rings of  to  members have been successfully synthesized using this method the reaction occurs in the presence of dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine the reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene the mechanism begins with formation of the pyridinethiol ester scheme  protontransfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone scheme  johnsoncoreychaykovsky reaction is useful for the synthesis of epoxides and cyclopropanes the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones ketones aldehydes and imines to form corresponding epoxides cyclopropanes and aziridines two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products scheme the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide provides epoxides from ketones but yields the cyclopropanes when enones are employed dimethylsulfonium methylide transforms ketones and enones to the corresponding epoxides dimethylsulfonium methylide is much more reactive and less stable than dimethylsulfoxonium methylide so it is generated at low temperatures based on their reactivity another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity the reaction is very well established and enantioselective variants catalytic and stoichiometric have also been achieved from a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes scheme  danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol diastereoselectivity is established by  interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure total synthesesedit e j corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses at least  molecules have been synthesized in the corey group since  his  total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics specifically the synthesis of prostaglandin fa presents several challenges the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable topological challenge for organic chemist coreys retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors scheme  molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a wittig reaction and hornerwadsworth emmons modification the wittig reaction affords the cis product while the hornerwadsworth emmons produces the trans olefin the published synthesis reveals a  diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride however years later corey and coworkers established the cbs reduction one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a  mixture of the desired diastereomer scheme  the iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key baeyervilliger intermediate this oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electronrich site the pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the dielsalder structural goal which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring later corey developed an asymmetric dielsalder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins other notable syntheses longifolene ginkgolides a and b lactacystin miroestrol ecteinascidin

supervised by prof corey was jason altom altoms suicide caused controversy because he explicitly blamed corey his research advisor for his suicide corey was devastated and bewildered by altoms death altom cited in his  farewell note abusive research supervisors as one reason for taking his life altoms suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors corey is quoted as stating that letter doesnt make sense at the end jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme corey also is on record as stating that he never questioned mr altoms intellectual contributions i did my best to guide jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain i did my best every step of the way corey states my conscience is clear everything jason did came out of our partnership we never had the slightest disagreement as a result of altoms death the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis the american foundation for suicide prevention afsp cited the new york times article on altoms suicide as an example of problematic reporting and suggested that corey was unfairly scapegoated according to the boston globe altoms suicide note indicated fear that his career hopes were doomed but the globe also cited students and professors as saying that altom actually retained coreys support before altom two of coreys other graduate students had committed suicide corey group membersedit as of  approximately  people have been corey group members a database of  former members and their current affiliation was developed for coreys th birthday in july  woodward–hoffmann rulesedit when awarded the priestley medal in  e j corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired robert burns woodward prior to the development of the woodward–hoffmann rules corey wrote on may   i suggested to my colleague r b woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed homo molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → butadiene and hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules this was coreys first public statement on his claim that starting on may   woodward put forth coreys explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may  corey had discussed his claim privately with hoffmann and close colleagues since  corey mentions that he made the priestley statement so the historical record would be correct coreys claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by roald hoffmann in the journal angewandte chemie in the rebuttal hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt harvard and that he would not consider doing anything against harvard to which i was and am so devoted corey also hoped that woodward himself would correct the historical record as he grew older more considerate and more sensitive to his own conscience woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in  awards and honorsedit ej corey has received more

prize in chemistry for his development of the theory and methodology of organic synthesis specifically retrosynthetic analysis regarded by many as one of the greatest living chemists he has developed numerous synthetic reagents methodologies and total syntheses and has advanced the science of organic synthesis considerably contents  biography  major contributions  reagents  methodology  total syntheses  publications  altom suicide  corey group members  woodward–hoffmann rules  awards and honors  references  external links biographyedit ej corey the surname was anglicized from the lebanese arabic khoury meaning priest was born to christian lebanese immigrants in methuen massachusetts  km  mi north of boston his mother changed his name to elias to honor his father who died eighteen months after coreys birth his widowed mother brother two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house struggling through the great depression as a young boy corey was rather independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball football and hiking he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence massachusetts at the age of  corey entered mit where he earned both a bachelors degree in  and a phd under professor john c sheehan in  upon entering mit coreys only experience with science was in mathematics and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his longterm career plans and graduated with a bachelors degree in chemistry immediately thereafter at the invitation of professor john c sheehan corey remained at mit for his phd after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign where he became a full professor of chemistry in  at the age of  he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in  in  he moved to harvard university where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health he has also been an advisor to pfizer for more than  years among numerous honors corey was awarded the national medal of science in  the nobel prize in chemistry in  and the american chemical societys greatest honor the priestley medal in  major contributionsedit reagentsedit ej corey has developed several new synthetic reagents pcc pyridinium chlorochromate also referred to as the coreysuggs reagent is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes pcc has several advantages over other commercial oxidants one of these advantages is that the compound is available as an airstable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic unlike other oxidizing agents pcc can accomplish single oxidations with only about  equivalents scheme  the alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium vi metal displacing chlorine the chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium iv the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes scheme  the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene after elimination and further oxidation the product is a cyclic ketone if this product is undesired powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis scheme  this example illustrates that pcc is capable of performing a dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a sigmatropic rearrangement tbutyldimethylsilyl ether tbs triisopropylsilyl ether tips and methoxyethoxymethyl mem are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since  the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group tbs is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions more importantly tbs ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as grignard reagents and enolates in the field of complex molecule synthesis tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the siliconbased protecting groups scheme  the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers other means of tbs deprotection include acids also lewis acids and fluorides tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether but longer reaction times are generally needed usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf but the hindered tbs ether below survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal scheme  the mem protecting group was first described by corey in  this protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage scheme  dithianes were pioneered by ej corey in  as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a lewis acid scheme  or directly from carbonyl compounds the pka of dithianes is approximately  allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent typically nbutyllithium the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the coreyseebach reaction the dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming electrophiles after deprotection of the dithiane usually with hgo a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis scheme  dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene methodologyedit several reactions developed in coreys lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least  methods have been developed in the corey group since  several reactions have been named after him coreyitsuno reduction also known as the coreybakshishibata reduction is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst scheme  later corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable the reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at nitrogen coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complexscheme  lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity allowing coordination with the ketone substrate the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the bo bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a membered ring transition state leading to a fourmembered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists scheme  the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and coworkers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a boranedimethylsulfide complex coreyfuchs alkyne synthesis is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a onecarbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide reacting the phosphorus ylide with the aldehyde substrate yields a dibromoolefin on treatment with two equivalents of nbuli lithium halogen exchange and deprotonation yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product scheme  more recently a onepot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis taylorione by wj kerr and coworkers scheme  the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones this process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations with the use of nchlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride ncs dimethylsulfide dms and triethylamine tea the coreykim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species scheme  the alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product the reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility in the total synthesis of ingenol kuwajima and coworkers exploited the coreykim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcoholscheme  coreywinter olefination is a stereospecific transformation of diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate thiocarbonyldiimidazole and excess trialkylphosphite the mechanism has been narrowed down to two possible pathways but the exact mechanism is unknown specifically the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate nonetheless the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain more importantly stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates professor tkm shing et al used the coreywinter olefination reaction to synthesize boesenoxide scheme  cbs enantioselective dielsalder reaction has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective cbs reduction after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized membered ring pretransition state to deliver highly enantioenriched products scheme  this transition state likely occurs because of favorable pistacking with the phenyl substituent the enantioselectivity of the process is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent the dielsalder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the dielsalder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of sixmembered ringsscheme  coreynicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones previously intermolecular outcompeted intramolecular lactonization even at low concentrations one big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and baselabile functional groups to date rings of  to  members have been successfully synthesized using this method the reaction occurs in the presence of dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine the reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene the mechanism begins with formation of the pyridinethiol ester scheme  protontransfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone scheme  johnsoncoreychaykovsky reaction is useful for the synthesis of epoxides and cyclopropanes the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones ketones aldehydes and imines to form corresponding epoxides cyclopropanes and aziridines two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products scheme the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide provides epoxides from ketones but yields the cyclopropanes when enones are employed dimethylsulfonium methylide transforms ketones and enones to the corresponding epoxides dimethylsulfonium methylide is much more reactive and less stable than dimethylsulfoxonium methylide so it is generated at low temperatures based on their reactivity another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity the reaction is very well established and enantioselective variants catalytic and stoichiometric have also been achieved from a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes scheme  danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol diastereoselectivity is established by  interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure total synthesesedit e j corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses at least  molecules have been synthesized in the corey group since  his  total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics specifically the synthesis of prostaglandin fa presents several challenges the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable topological challenge for organic chemist coreys retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors scheme  molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a wittig reaction and hornerwadsworth emmons modification the wittig reaction affords the cis product while the hornerwadsworth emmons produces the trans olefin the published synthesis reveals a  diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride however years later corey and coworkers established the cbs reduction one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a  mixture of the desired diastereomer scheme  the iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key baeyervilliger intermediate this oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electronrich site the pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the dielsalder structural goal which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring later corey developed an asymmetric dielsalder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins other notable syntheses longifolene ginkgolides a and b lactacystin miroestrol ecteinascidin

altom cited in his  farewell note abusive research supervisors as one reason for taking his life altoms suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors corey is quoted as stating that letter doesnt make sense at the end jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme corey also is on record as stating that he never questioned mr altoms intellectual contributions i did my best to guide jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain i did my best every step of the way corey states my conscience is clear everything jason did came out of our partnership we never had the slightest disagreement as a result of altoms death the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis the american foundation for suicide prevention afsp cited the new york times article on altoms suicide as an example of problematic reporting and suggested that corey was unfairly scapegoated according to the boston globe altoms suicide note indicated fear that his career hopes were doomed but the globe also cited students and professors as saying that altom actually retained coreys support before altom two of coreys other graduate students had committed suicide corey group membersedit as of  approximately  people have been corey group members a database of  former members and their current affiliation was developed for coreys th birthday in july  woodward–hoffmann rulesedit when awarded the priestley medal in  e j corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired robert burns woodward prior to the development of the woodward–hoffmann rules corey wrote on may   i suggested to my colleague r b woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed homo molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → butadiene and hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules this was coreys first public statement on his claim that starting on may   woodward put forth coreys explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may  corey had discussed his claim privately with hoffmann and close colleagues since  corey mentions that he made the priestley statement so the historical record would be correct coreys claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by roald hoffmann in the journal angewandte chemie in the rebuttal hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt harvard and that he would not consider doing anything against harvard to which i was and am so devoted corey also hoped that woodward himself would correct the historical record as he grew older more considerate and more sensitive to his own conscience woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in  awards and honorsedit ej corey has received more
