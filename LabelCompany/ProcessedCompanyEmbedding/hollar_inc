executive david yeom christina house  for the times paresh davecontact reporter david yeom and brian lee were chowing down at a carls jr last spring discussing asianspecialty dollar stores — those stripmall shops stacked with kitchen goods and other household items sold for cheapthey figured a lot of people like themselves had pawed through the bargain bins looking for gems among the junk — but for whatever reason didnt really mention that fact to anyone“we cant help ourselves … everyone loves getting a deal” yeom said “we just dont like that feeling of being cheap or the experience of poor merchandise” its the thought “i dont want to run into anyone” at such an establishment he saidto save likeminded individuals from the embarrassment of being caught live in a dollar store and maybe make a buck in the process the two came up with an idea bring the dollar store to the internet well more like a twodollar store on thursday santa monicabased hollar inc started putting online

where its all about design and aesthetics”industry experts are dubious about the moneymaking potential given the merchandising challenges and shipping costs that exceed the price of any individual itemsuccess in this case demands innovation but not the kind in which one big idea appears in a flash of inspiration this endeavor will require choosing among the most innovative ideas based on hollar executives experience in the retail industry and piecing them together to make what seems like a crazy idea work we are this melting pot of the best incredible companies weve helped build or that we

as a former employee of honest he formerly worked at shoedazzlesign up for the free california inc business newsletter the founders agreed that exceptional visual presentation is key to drawing online shoppers to dollarstore merchandise“we brought in a team that has a lot of experience in production photography design and copy writing … making sure that even though its a  product it feels like a

that it makes me smile” one tester saidsmiles are nice but what about profitssucharita mulpuru an online shopping analyst at consulting agency forrester research has her doubts sourcing and shipping lowcost products at a profit is a tough business she notes that at groupon goods the companys discountproducts store profits are scant though sales are soaring“if it were that easy to just sell all the little tchotchkes at a grocery store checkout online and ship them someone would have done it by now” mulpuru said she predicts prices on hollar will have to risethe potential for revenue is certainly there the nations leading dollar stores had sales of about  billion last year nearly all from physical locationsyeom said hollars success depends on “creative sourcing” with “very favorable” costs cofounder ums experience at  cents only stores and knowledge of the discountgoods supply chain could prove crucial goods will include brandname merchandise out of season or out of favor supplemented by purchases from contractors in chinato keep shipping costs reasonable hollar imposes a checkout minimum of  — or  for free shipping yeom borrowed the idea from boxedcom — an online retailer similar to costco run by a friend — as a way to avoid unprofitable orders he figures his customer base can afford the minimums and the free shipping choice will push the average order significantly over bundles and kits provide another way to fill virtual shopping baskets past the minimum a bundle might offer all the  supplies you need to throw a “frozen”themed kids birthday party

venturesjeremy liew a partner at lightspeed ventures known for being entertainment app snapchat incs first investor said hes betting that the hollar teams experience will enable it to adapt if its initial strategies dont pan out but hes also guessing consumers will come running if the products stand out as much as he hopes “its a big market its a big idea” he said “the biggest unknown is what
