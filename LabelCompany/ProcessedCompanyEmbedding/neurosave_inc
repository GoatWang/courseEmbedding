neurosave the potential for better brain coolingin a clinical trial with patients undergoing cardiac surgery neurosave therapy demonstrated brain cooling that was fastcooling the brain by °c in less than  minutes targetedkeeping the brain at least °c below core body temperature deepdecreasing the brain temperature by   °c  our goal our goal is to rapidly deliver the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia to the brain while protecting the body from the negative effects of cooling   potential benefitsfastin a clinical trial neurosave cooled the brain more than  times faster than nonsurgical technology used in hospitals todaytargetedneurosave is designed to cool primarily the brain potentially reducing the risks associated with body cooling deepin a clinical trial neurosave cooled the
