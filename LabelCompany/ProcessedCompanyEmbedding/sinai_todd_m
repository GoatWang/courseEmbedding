carlson school of management national bureau of economic research nber university of minnesota  twin cities  department of economics date written october  abstract we study the tendency to connect to the internet and the online and offline shopping behavior of connected persons to draw inferences about whether the internet is a substitute or a complement for cities we document that larger markets have more locallytargeted online content and that individuals are more likely to connect in markets with more local online content suggesting the internet is a complement to cities yet holding local online content constant people are less likely to connect in larger markets indicating that the internet is also a substitute for cities we also find that individuals connect to overcome local isolation notwithstanding a large digital divide blacks are more likely to connect relative to whites when they comprise a smaller fraction of local population making the internet a substitute for agglomeration of preference minorities within cities finally using online and offline spending data we find that connected persons spend more on books and clothing online relative to their offline spending if they are farther from offline stores this indicates that the internet functions as a substitute for proximity to retail outlets suggested citation suggested citation sinai todd m and
