for those manufacturers who run high volume dedicated lines with the ability to run all flux types including high solids rosin the f ultrasonic spray fluxing system is ideal for high volume production using high solids rosin flux it features very low maintenance and is equipped with a high velocity flux transfer system to help with pcbs that have difficulty with topside fill such as those with thick back planes tight leadtohole ratios or contaminated components pcb width range of  inches  mm or  inches  mm with flux deposition range of  –  ugin for typical noclean fluxes sonotek offers full service and support for all of our ultrasonic spray fluxing equipment sonoflux f features only a monthly clean up even with rosin flux high velocity flux transfer for maximum topside fill uniform coverage reduction in flux consumption up to  nonclogging ultrasonic design elimination of thinner easy operation and maintenance compatibility with all fluxes deposition density control microgramsinch single or dual nozzle configurations available the f is designed with a high transfer efficiency spray assembly and a closed spray chamber to capture any rosin flux vapor in the environmentthe system can either be installed internally in your wave solder machine or can be available as a standalone unit both with a variety of optional features sonotek uses the ecd fluxometer to test edge to edge coverage and throughhole penetration click on the image for an enlarged view low maintenance and no operator intervention are the primary features of the sonoflux f only a monthly cleaning is necessary even with sticky rosin flux the system is also equipped with a high velocity flux transfer system to help with pcbs that have difficulty with topside fill such as those with

widetrack flat glass coating systems deposit a soft uniform controllable spray over any size sheets of flat glass panels with no dripping and very little overspray and atmospheric contamination the widetrack system offers significant advantages over conventional pressure spray methods in a broad range of applications whether you are coating moving webs of automotive manufacturing flat glass architectural glass antireflection layers onto solar glass flat panel displays or touch screens the widetrack system maintains precise control of the coating at the flow rate you specify waste is greatly reduced when using ultrasonic spray since the low velocity spray produces minimal overspray with no bounceback of material off the substrate and maintenance is kept to a minimum because ultrasonic nozzles will not clog in addition the titanium and  stainless steel construction of the widetrack makes it compatible with glass manufacturing solutions ultrasonic spray enables very thin uniform layers and tight deposition control that is not possible with pressure spray the widetrack coating system uses a nonclogging ultrasonic atomizing nozzle to produce a lowvelocity highly controllable spray for reliable consistent results widetrack system benefits for glass manufacturing processes economical alternative to cvd deposition methods nonclogging ultrasonic nozzle ensures drip free spray mist ultralow flow rate capabilities intermittent or continuous covers up to ” with one nozzle or use multiple nozzles to cover any width substrate uniform coating with high transfer efficiency lowvelocity spray – minimal bounceback and overspray no moving parts proven in glass manufacturing plants worldwide reduced material consumption operating principle each spray assembly contains a pair of air jets which alternately pulse to drive the spray downward the timing and force of the pulses produces a spray pattern that oscillates back and forth across the substrate send me
