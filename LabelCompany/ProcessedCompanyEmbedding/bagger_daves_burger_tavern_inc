events bagger daves why daveour burger tavern is named in memory of michael’s fatherinlaw dave a well loved family man with a passion for life business and restaurants we honor this passion in all that we do and continue to be inspired by him everyday what’s a baggerno idea it sounded good with dave and made for an interesting conversation we often tell folks to look for the little guy with the baggie pants why a tavernwe wanted to create a celebrated “local” place that served fresh food similar to early american taverns along the stagecoach trails while america was settling what could be better than a tavern serving distinctive burgers belgian style handcut fries and local american craft beers prime rib burgersafter countless hours of research and numerous tastings with the help of many inspirational chefs we found our prime rib recipe one made from a distinctive combination of perfectly seasoned sirloin chuck and prime rib our burgers are fresh locally sourced from  grainfed cattle with no fillers or preservatives we do it belgian stylethe research behind this one is mindblowing after meeting a local professor in east lansing mi who was often referred to as “dr spud” we decided to source a very special boutique potato grown out east despite the fact that this particular potato is difficult to source we would settle for nothing less the next challenge was actually cooking the potato to create authentic belgian style fries after endless hours of research and testing we settled on a sixstep very labor intensive process that was well worth the effort by the way since we use natural transfat free oils with no breaded products in our fryers our fries are gluten free also we are different from those other places our fries are fresh and have no fructose coating meticulously sourced fresh food and recipesthe best ground turkey comes from grand rapids mi it’s all natural contains no antibiotics or hormones and makes our famous turkey burger our buns from a local baker friend in detroit are made using a thermal oil process to gently bake each bun to perfection inspired by a trip to traverse city mi our variety of craft sodas are made with only the finest real cane sugar awardwinning ashby’s ice cream of shelby township mi is in all of our handdipped shakes and floats the handcut sweet potato chips with honey cinnamon salt dipping sauce were discovered while traveling to tampa fl our turkey black bean chili was created by our chef friend in cincinnati oh a city famous for knowing a thing or two or three about chili riding the bar railwe feel like our handcrafted burgers and fries are best paired with something that is as equally as local and just as much cared for and loved by the makers enter our craft beer wine and cocktail menu while we don’t brew our own beer we do take pride in bringing you the best of each local brewery where our restaurants are located you’ll need to stop in often as our tap list is rotated regularly if beer isn’t your thing you can try our lineup of specialty cocktails and wine that pair just as well with our food as they do with friends bagger daves  wikipedia bagger daves from wikipedia the free

million market cap holding  million of net cash and most of their leases guaranteed by saucafter closing a dozen locations bdvb generated positive operating cash flow in q management is focused on generating cash and has no capex planselevator pitch bagger daves burger tavern otcpkbdvb is a recent spinoff from diversified restaurant holdings nasdaqsauc the largest franchisee of buffalo wild wings nasdaqbwld as a nano cap spinco with a spotty year history in a saturated casual dining marketplace the shares have been fire sold in the past week to a point where risk vs reward is very compelling since bdvb started trading  weeks ago shares have traded down from book value of  to  company description bdvb operates a chain of  casual dining burger joints the taverns are fullservice and well stocked with local craft beer menus feature locally sourced never frozen prime rib or allnatural turkey burgers and hand cut fries the chain launched in  with their first location in berkley michigan as of march   there are  locations in michigan  in indiana and  in ohio since  a dozen locations were closed including  in my current state of indiana thesis and catalyst christmas miracle gone wrong back in august of  diversified restaurant holdings got fed up with bagger daves burger tavern and decided it was time to put the year old chain up for adoption on christmas day of  it became official the papers were signed and bdvb was spun off since the spinoff sauc shares have more than doubled fast forward to may   things got even better bdvb shares got adopted by shareholders and closed at book value it seemed like bdvbs new parents knew what the stock was worth unfortunately for bdvb its new parents decided the following week that the stock was not worth hanging onto and many ran for the hills shares traded sharply down from  to as low as  the epic purge with little liquidity a  million nano market cap and virtually no coverage it makes sense why investors would purge their shares no institutions have the patience or mandate to sit around and watch this tiny company grow many retail investors are perfectly content getting even a dime for these shares after doubling their money from their investments in sauc the purge was pretty epic watching the bidask action was like watching  on my bloomberg spinoff sellers were basically the persian army plowing through leonidas at the hot gates of thermopylae with myself and only a handful of brave investors to throw spears at themistokles to make matters worse the investor relations page says coming soon aside from a single q filed in may of  previous segment financials and commentary from sauc public filings all pointed fingers at bdvb as the source of their struggles for unfamiliar prospective investors a simple google search will yield many articles on bdvb closures and mediocre reviews the concept becomes a tougher long in a vastly overretailed american marketplace saturated with casual dining options liquidity umbilical cord  downside protection financial risk is low bdvb is well capitalized and generated positive operating cash flow in q the company has plenty of liquidity no debt and has the majority of their leases guaranteed by sauc with the spinoff sauc contributed  million of cash to bagger for working capital bdvb may also call an additional  million if things get bad bdvb should have no problem meeting cash needs for the year management has guided for ga expense and capital expenditures totaling  million for fy on the liability side bdvb has no debt and was released as an obligor of sauc debt prior to the spinoff bagger daves was a coobligor on a joint and several basis with drh on drhs  million senior secured credit facility drhs debt under the facility remained with drh and bagger daves was released as a borrower  q sauc has also guaranteed certain lease obligations for bdvb drh is listed as the guarantor on  of the  bagger daves leases drh would be liable for ongoing rent payments for open locations the guarantees range from one to  years and approximate  million as of march    q capex freeze  cream bdvb is not a growth story the company is focused on cash flow i am a fan of this model because i am born and raised in staten island aka shaolin aka cash rules everything around me managements focus is on streamlining the current footprint and generating free cash management has no nearterm intentions to grow the business and investors should not expect any remodels refreshes or new locations for fy management guides for fy capex of  million with no new restaurants openings or remodels we will not commit to further development of new bagger daves restaurants until we are confident that we can obtain and maintain a target return on investment we believe that following this strategy will significantly reduce our capital needs and increase operating cash flow in the near term  q with the young average age of our stores the recent capital expenditures to upgrade some of our older facilities and our focus on achieving positive free cash flow we have no plans for any significant level of capital expenditures  q achievable todo list  cross hairs on profitability operating risk is low bdvb is over  years into a successful restructuring effort exiting  underperforming locations in  and one in q with management laser focused on streamlining q cash flow from operations was positive and q samestore sales were positive with over  million in sales management has laid out a realistic strategic plan for a path to profitability sales initiatives bdvb hopes to grow average weekly volumes auw from the current low base of  in  key initiatives include a redesign of the menu the first ever cable television campaign and speeding up service with new kitchen processes gross margin improvement bdvb also aims to improve gross margins by working closely with vendors improving productivity and reducing waste food beverage and packaging cost in q were  of sales down from  in q overhead reduction in spite of industry woes on rising labor costs bdvb expects reductions in direct labor costs with efforts to alleviate employee turnover which has greatly impacted their labor costs at the restaurant level bdvb has engaged a third party to review and renegotiate current leases and real estate taxes occupancy costs in q were  of sales vs  in q marketing budgets have been cut bdvb guides for fy marketing spend at  of sales down from  historically marketing is being shifted towards higher roi local marketing initiatives guest experience improving from  stars to  reviews are improving bdvb locations are pretty isolated in the midwest so the best due diligence most investors can hope for are reviews google reviews are decent in the star range yelp reviews are mediocre in the star range older reviews drag down overall yelp ratings but recent reviews show notable improvement conclusion one mans trash is another mans treasure as a result of technical selling by institutions retail investors happy to cash out at any price and virtually no coverage or investor relations we have a stock that is trading at ⅓ of book value for this fire sale price investors get a decent collection of streamlined burger joints a wellcapitalized balance sheet good management and an umbilical cord still attached to a strong parent valuation my target price is book value of  the balance sheet is clean and cash burn is not a concern bdvb has  million of cash no debt  guaranteed leases and m of intangibles cash burn is unlikely with positive operating cash flow and no growth capex on the horizon longer term mike can easily crush my target price and reach  decent burger joints that serve expensive beer should have no problems breaking  ebitda margins  restaurants with  million in average unit volumes auv earning  ebitda margins would generate  million of ebitda which is just over half of the current enterprise value of  million company management bdvb is run under the direct leadership of michael ansley who was the founder ceo and chairman of sauc mike is not new to the restaurant business or to running a public company after running sauc for almost  years with his extensive experience and sauc resources at his disposal he is overqualified to run a chain of  burger joints with a  million market cap i am guessing that mike is at least a little more optimistic in bdvb than recent sellers of the stock disclosure i amwe are long bdvb sauc i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am
