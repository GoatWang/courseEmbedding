retirement income portfolio series℠ the american funds retirement income portfolio series consists of three managed portfolios — conservative moderate and enhanced — that can help retirees address their income and longevity needs made up of american funds these portfolios were created by the american funds portfolio oversight committee — a sevenmember team of senior investment managers — based on extensive research and their indepth knowledge of the underlying funds seek to support varying withdrawal rate ranges and risk tolerances while maintaining as much of a retiree’s initial investment as possible were designed to be a part of a broadly diversified retirement income portfolio  overview  portfolios features benefits portfoliooversight jump to  overview  portfolios features  benefits portfolio oversight overview a recent survey found that the chief concern among retirees is having the ability to maintain their lifestyles in retirement in addition investors in retirement want to be assured of asset growth as they take withdrawals from their investments the american funds retirement income portfolio series strives to be a withdrawal source for a retiree’s lifestyle — or discretionary — spending needs as a complement to other investments and sources of income in their portfolios preserve as much of the initial investment as possible even as retirees take regular withdrawals translating need and risk into withdrawal rate ranges the american funds portfolio oversight committee used extensive research and modeling to determine the suggested annual withdrawal rate ranges for each of the three portfolios risk of loss in this case is defined by the portfolio oversight committee as an increased exposure to equities which can lead to greater volatility in the portfolio and potentially impact both withdrawal rates and whether overall assets invested will decline over time each retirement income portfolio is designed to address varying income needs and risk tolerances and each has a suggested annual withdrawal rate range these suggested withdrawal rate ranges were determined by the portfolio oversight committee based on their experience and indepth knowledge of the underlying funds as well as the extensive research and computer simulations used to create each portfolio were based on income and capital gain expectations — taken from both historical data as well as market projections — for each of the portfolios are suggestions only and should be evaluated over time these ranges are a starting point the actual rate should be determined on an individual basis by the financial advisor and retiree and should be adjusted to maintain sustainability in various market conditions in addition differences in the portfolio returns inflation or deflation and interest rates over time may prompt the portfolio oversight committee to change the suggested withdrawal rate ranges may include part of the investor’s principal to the extent the income earned by the portfolio in dividends and bond income is less than the withdrawal amount the portfolios are designed to accommodate this and will seek to grow assets over time as well as provide withdrawals though there is no guarantee the portfolios will support a given withdrawal rate in all market environments should be determined by individual investors as one part of their total retirement income picture including social security or other sources of guaranteed or interest income these portfolios are designed to address lifestyle or discretionary expenses in retirement not necessarily basic living expenses portfolios collapse all conservative portfolio american funds retirement income portfolio — conservative℠ with significant allocations to the bond fund of america®

withdrawal rates and risk tolerances actively monitored they benefit from the ongoing research and attention of the american funds portfolio oversight committee portfolio oversight the american funds portfolio oversight committee — investment professionals who have a long history of successfully managing funds to pursue investor objectives — developed and monitor the american funds retirement income portfolio series retirement income portfolios are complex at times the need to take withdrawals can conflict with the desire for capital preservation the historical roles of stocks and bonds have shifted in recent years making the interplay between markets more difficult to navigate that’s why the committee performed exhaustive proprietary research analyzing both historical data and likely future scenarios deployed data that reflects both even and extreme market conditions relied on their deep experience in managing the underlying american funds these seven seasoned american funds portfolio managers offer experience the committee averages  years of industry experience familiarity they know the underlying funds well all manage at least one of the underlying funds in the portfolios oversight they continually monitor the portfolios — more intensely in times of volatility supporting products iras investments are not fdicinsured nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by

expressed in years average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the funds portfolio to a given change in interest rates with respect to individual bonds for example a duration of  years indicates that the price of a bond will risefall by approximately  if rates in general fallrise by  typically bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes bond statistic average life in years expressed in years average life is time weighting the expected principal payments taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments in general it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity eg mortgages mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the funds portfolio bond statistic average yield to maturity a weighted average of all the funds bond holdings yield to maturities yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity based on its price and coupon assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity capture ratio

approach is likely to lead to less downside risk but also currently offers investors a lower level of current income and longterm growth potential types of investments the underlying american funds

average life is time weighting the expected principal payments taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments in general it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity eg mortgages mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the funds

investors since  the funds cover all major asset classes and are available through products offered by many of the nation’s insurance leaders about variable annuities variable annuities are among the fastest growing retirement investments despite their popularity many people still don’t know much about them an annuity is a contract issued by an insurance company that can include an option to turn your assets into an income you can’t outlive annuities can be good for retirement because taxes aren’t due on variable annuity earnings until they are withdrawn variable annuities are designed to be retirement investments and because of this taxdeferral feature there is typically a  federal tax penalty on earnings withdrawn before age ½ when you buy a variable annuity contract your money is invested in funds — similar to mutual funds — that are managed by investment professionals returns on your investment fluctuate as the prices of the stocks and bonds in the funds rise and fall that’s why the annuity is called “variable” backed by the claimspaying ability of the issuing insurance company   benefits andavailability afis insuranceseries funds afis managedrisk funds afis
