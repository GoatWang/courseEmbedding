outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties there is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel furthermore competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation andor regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of developing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position company description we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and associated liquidsrich natural gas reserves in the permian basin our assets are concentrated in the delaware basin a subbasin of the permian basin our properties consist of large contiguous acreage blocks in reeves ward and pecos counties in west texas as of june   our portfolio included  operated producing horizontal wells our horizontal wells span an area approximately  miles long by  miles wide where we have established commercial production in five distinct zones the rd bone spring sandstone upper wolfcamp a lower wolfcamp a wolfcamp b and wolfcamp c as a result we have broadly appraised our acreage across various geographic areas and stratigraphic zones which we expect will allow us to efficiently develop our drilling inventory with a focus on maximizing returns to our stockholders in addition we believe our acreage may be prospective for the nd and rd bone spring shales and avalon shale where other operators have experienced drilling success near our acreage we have leased or acquired approximately  net acres approximately  of which we operate as of june   our acreage is predominantly located in the southern portion of the delaware basin where production and reserves typically contain a higher percentage of oil and natural gas liquids and a correspondingly lower percentage of natural gas compared to the northern portion of the delaware basin after temporarily suspending drilling activity at the end of march  to preserve capital we added one horizontal rig in june  and expect to add a second horizontal rig in the fourth quarter of  during  we operated on average one rig and placed  horizontal wells on production our development drilling plan is comprised exclusively of horizontal drilling with an ongoing focus on reducing drilling times optimizing completions and reducing costs the permian basin is an attractive operating area due to its extensive original oilinplace favorable operating environment multiple horizontal zones high oil and liquidsrich natural gas content welldeveloped network of oilfield service providers longlived reserves with relatively consistent reservoir quality and historically high drilling success rates according to the energy information administration of the us department of energy the “eia” the permian basin is the most prolific oil producing area in the united states accounting for  and  of total us crude oil production during the twelvemonth periods ended april   and april   respectively over the past decade the delaware basin has experienced significant horizontal drilling according to baker hughes three of the top six permian basin counties by horizontal rig count are located in the delaware basin reeves county where the majority of our acreage is located had the second most horizontal rigs of any us county as of june   with  rigs as of such date as a result of this horizontal drilling the delaware basin is the only region in the united states that has experienced sustained fourth quartertofourth quarter production growth rates greater than  for the past three years  production mmboe permian basin delaware wolfcamp midland wolfcamp bakken three bone spring spraberry eagle ford forks fourth quarter      fourth quarter      fourth quarter      fourth quarter       does not include production in the permian basin beyond the midland and delaware basins source ihs performance evaluator as of april  based on recent well results and significant decreases in drilling and completion costs we believe the delaware basin represents one of the most attractive operating regions in the united states according to data from ihs performance evaluator in    and  wells in the delaware basin had a higher average threemonth cumulative initial production per  feet of lateral section than wells in the midland basin another subbasin of the permian basin these results are driven primarily by the overpressured nature of the bone spring and wolfcamp reservoirs in the delaware basin which enhances the deliverability of horizontal wells we believe these results indicate the wolfcamp and the bone spring formations in the delaware basin generate greater implied eurs per  feet of lateral length as compared to the spraberry and wolfcamp zones in the midland basin  we were formed by an affiliate of natural gas partners “ngp” a family of energyfocused private equity investments funds our goal is to build a premier development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling in the delaware basin our key management and technical team members average approximately  years of experience and have successfully led development operations in prolific oil basins in the continental united states including horizontal development in the permian bakken and niobrara plays this expertise and technical acumen have been applied to the horizontal drilling and multistage completions on our properties resulting in drilling success and continuous operating improvements across multiple zones we have assembled a multiyear inventory of horizontal drilling projects as of june   we had identified  gross horizontal drilling locations in the rd bone spring sandstone upper wolfcamp a lower wolfcamp a wolfcamp b and wolfcamp c zones across our delaware basin acreage based on spacing of four wells per acre section in the rd bone spring sandstone and five to six wells per acre section in the wolfcamp zones our drilling inventory includes  extended lateral locations of either  or  lateral feet our nearterm drilling program is focused on both the upper and lower wolfcamp a zones but we also intend to drill locations in the rd bone spring sandstone wolfcamp b and wolfcamp c zones based on our and other operators’ well results and our analysis of geologic and engineering data we believe the nd and rd bone spring shales and avalon shale may also be prospective across our acreage and we may integrate these zones into our future drilling program as they become further delineated the following table provides a summary of our gross horizontal drilling locations by zone as of june   gross identified horizontal drilling locations total zones rd bone spring sandstone  upper wolfcamp a  lower wolfcamp a  wolfcamp b  wolfcamp c  total horizontal locations   our total identified horizontal drilling locations include  locations associated with proved undeveloped reserves as of december   we have estimated our drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions and upon the evaluation of our horizontal drilling results and those of other operators in our area combined with our interpretation of available geologic and engineering data in particular we have analyzed and interpreted well results and other data acquired through our participation in the drilling of vertical wells that have penetrated our horizontal zones in addition to evaluate the prospectivity of our horizontal acreage we have performed openhole and mud log evaluations core analysis and drill cuttings analysis the drilling locations that we actually drill will depend on the availability of capital regulatory approvals commodity prices costs actual drilling results and other factors any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these identified locations may not be successful and may not result in our ability to add additional proved reserves to our existing proved reserves further to the extent the drilling locations are associated with acreage that expires we would lose our right to develop the related locations  our horizontal drilling location count implies foot spacing with five to six wells per acre section in the wolfcamp zones and foot spacing with four wells per acre section in the rd bone spring sandstone in each case consisting primarily of singlesection ie approximately foot laterals   of our  horizontal drilling locations are on acreage that we operate we have an approximate  average working interest in our operated acreage  we have included undeveloped horizontal locations only on our leasehold in reeves and ward counties we believe that development drilling of our  gross horizontal locations with an increasing focus on drilling extended lateral wells as well as potential downspacing will allow us to grow our production and reserves in addition we believe our large acreage blocks allow us to optimize our horizontal development program to maximize our resource recovery and our returns we also intend to grow our production and reserves through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives furthermore we believe our operational efficiency is enhanced by a thirdparty gas gathering system and cryogenic processing plant which were built specifically for the area where the majority of our acreage is located and our operated saltwater disposal system in addition a thirdparty crude gathering system which is expected to be operational in the third quarter of  and which will transport the majority of our crude oil to market at a lower cost than we have experienced historically will provide additional efficiencies we experienced a significant decrease in our drilling and completion costs during  which has continued into  this trend has been driven by efficiency improvements in the field including reduced drilling days the modification of well designs and reduction or elimination of unnecessary costs additionally overall service costs have declined as a result of reduced industry demand for the three months ended march   the spudtorig release for our three singlesection horizontal wells was approximately  days compared to  days and  days for all singlesection horizontal wells we drilled in  and  respectively we expect that further optimization in the field including the increased drilling of longer laterals pad drilling the use of shared facilities and zipper fracs reduced rig rates and lower service costs will improve our well economics our  capital budget for drilling completion and recompletion activities and facilities costs is approximately  million excluding leasing and other acquisitions we expect to allocate approximately  million of our  capital budget for the drilling and completion of operated wells and  million for our participation in the drilling and completion of nonoperated wells for  we have budgeted  million for leasing in the three months ended march   we incurred capital costs of approximately  million excluding leasing and acquisition costs because we operate approximately  of our net acreage the amount and timing of these capital expenditures are largely subject to our discretion we believe our approximate  average working interest in our operated acreage provides us with flexibility to manage our drilling program and optimize our returns and profitability we could choose to defer a portion of our planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil natural gas and ngls the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals drilling completion and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other working interest owners we have an approximate  working interest in our nonoperated acreage for the three months ended march   our average net daily production was  boed

 interview ward polzin centennial resource development the society of petroleum engineers there is often a disconnect between the consumers and producers of petroleum which is why its important to educate the public about how crude oil byproducts affect their everyday lives ward polzin says thinkstock interview ward polzin centennial resource development by angela dang chieke offurum and colter morgan  jul  ward polzin is chief executive officer of centennial resource development a denverbased private oil and gas company backed by natural gas partners polzin has more than  years of experience in the upstream oil and gas industry in engineering commercial investing and transactional roles prior to forming centennial polzin served as a managing director and founding partner in investment banking at tudor pickering holt  co where he spearheaded the firm’s exploration and production asset acquisition and divestiture practice since inception previously polzin served as the us country manager at enerplus resources and as a managing director with scotia waterous  co polzin has been an spe member for more than  years and is also a chartered financial analyst he holds a bs in petroleum engineering from the colorado school of mines and an mba from rice university how would you describe the commodities industry and its role in the oil and gas sector the oil and gas commodities industry ie the trading of oil and gas is highly critical oil and gas being traded as a commodity signifies that it is a global industry the trading of commodities— not just oil and gas but any commodity— is a global endeavor as such the price is set by a global market to me that is the most critical factor about oil and gas interest rates and oil prices are probably the two variables that have the greatest impact on the global economy interest rates more so but it also points to the importance of oil as a commodity oil and gas as a global market really took off in the s and s with the rise of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and the development of technology that physically allowed the barrel to move the advent of the internet and electronic technology that facilitates the stock and trading exchanges of the world also fueled the globalization of oil and gas trading what is the most common misconception about commodity prices and trends specifically for oil and gas either publicly or within the industry there is an assumption that traders set the price prices especially long term are set by the market’s perception of supply and demand—that is not just traders but also the end users and the producers of the commodity there are really three large groups that trade producers users and the “middle men” or what some people may call traders or speculators while they do influence prices and add volatility they do not really set the prices the oil and gas industry does not dictate the price at which the products are sold which other industries are subject to the same challenge how do they deal with such uncertainties there are several industries that are similar to oil and gas in terms of selling commodities—gold silver molybdenum really anything that is mined but i think maybe the industry that has the most in common with oil and gas is agriculture whether crops such as wheat or livestock the biggest challenge boils down to volatility—it is up some days it is down others which brings risk into the equation simplistically i see three ways although there may be many more for companies in the industry to protect themselves from volatile commodity prices firstly you could hedge meaning you can sell your product at a predetermined price—a forward sale of your product secondly you can diversify if you are an oil producer you have some gas in your portfolio or if you are a gas producer you can add some oil so that you are not exposed to just one commodity you can also diversify by basin or country different basins have different price discounts so you can minimize some forms of price exposure this way thirdly you can work on becoming the low cost operator lco if you can do it for less you can handle the lower prices we generally think of commodity in the traditional sense referring to mining oil gas agriculture etc but colloquially people say “my product has been ‘commoditized’” meaning that anyone can produce my product one example is solar panels now being manufactured less expensively in china than they were a few years ago have solar panels become a commodity not in a conventional sense but who survives the lco as the industry becomes more mature ultimately the prices are going to come down for whatever you produce by becoming an lco you can better cope with the volatility what are the effects of price decline on the us’ status as an oil and gas exporter you have to divide gas and oil and talk about each separately because the us is not legally allowed to export crude oil except to canada each commodity has its own uniqueness in the technical and political challenges it faces to be moved around the world oil is legally difficult but logistically easy to move just put it in tankers on the other hand gas is easier politically but hard logistically complex and expensive liquefied natural gas lng tankers the good news is that now the us seems to allow for the export of refined condensate which is a good step toward the ultimate export of oil the price decline creates a stronger desire for oil export when prices are high you are not as concerned with having access to more markets but when prices are low you just want all the markets you can find in which to sell the product low prices definitely put pressure on the us government to allow that and certainly more pressure on oil companies to try and get that changed gas is a good example of this since gas prices declined before oil price declined it is one step ahead clearly the lng export facilities trying to be permitted and built are an example of that the desire to export gas happened quicker because prices dropped quicker oil is following gas in this so there is a higher motivation to export oil given that the oil and gas industry is dictated by the price of its products in your opinion how important is it for engineers to understand this side of the industry critically important i guess it is a little selfserving because i have always been fascinated by the combination of finance and petroleum engineering i have also spent half of my career in the more financial part of the industry to me it is natural to want to put the two together engineers definitely have that technical mind and quite frankly if they have an interest in it they can easily develop an understanding of the financial side one of the biggest concerns as a young engineer in the oil and gas industry is layoffs during the downturns at what point does a company consider layoffs ie why would a company consider layoffs vs other costcutting measures in a downturn layoffs are not the first thing that happens first come the spending cuts even though people are expensive wells are more expensive so the first steps are cutting capital drilling less and slowing down projects the second costcutting target is lease operating expenses these are the costs of maintaining and operating property and equipment on a producing oil and gas lease third is the cutting of general and administrative expenses ga the primary ga expense is people  the next obvious question as a professional in the industry is how to deal with it in difficult times if you are already employed you want to make sure you are working on the best assets because the company is going to slow drilling in the worst assets first you do not always control where you are posted but if you can working the asset that stands the test of time is certainly a good place to be for the folks who are still trying to find that job i can relate to that extremely well because i graduated in  from colorado school of mines when there were minimal jobs i already loved the finance side and i could see it coming a year ahead of time so i went and got a business degree getting a higher education meant the addition of another skill to my resume graduating from business school in  was even worse but thankfully i had two degrees so that set me apart there is nothing wrong with going back to school but i have always advised folks against getting an extra degree just because it looks better on your resume you better like learning pursue something that truly interests you if you have that interest and desire go for it do it right now and you will be that much better and more competitive coming out of graduate school deciding on whether to pursue a business degree or a technical degree beyond the undergraduate level is one reserved for the individual a master’s in petroleum engineering would not have been right for me because i just loved combining the finances with the engineering either is a good route it is just a matter of personal preference what personal advice can you give young engineers about working in the volatile oil and gas industry one can use the same strategies that oil and gas companies use to minimize risk to navigate the industry  hedge how an individual hedges is education make sure you are constantly learning so that you are not pigeonholed into only knowing one part of the business diversify as a person diversifying does not mean you get a different job it just means that you make sure to keep your petroleum engineering skills broad yes have a focus—maybe you are a completions engineer or a reservoir engineer—but you should be learning all you can about the other engineering disciplines even though you do not become an expert it is important to appreciate and understand all the parts of the puzzle in getting oil out of the ground and moving it be an lco from an individual’s standpoint it means bringing more value as opposed to cost to your employer you have to be able to do more than what is being asked of you digging deeper to understand the numbers a little bit better and taking a project further than “the answer” it is not about having the answer it is about what you do with that answer—provide a solution and implement it in a  the new york times op ed article titled “the high cost of gambling on oil” joseph p kennedy ii states “speculators add little value and lots of cost as they bid up the price of oil in pursuit of financial gain they should be banned from the world’s commodity exchanges which could drive down the price of oil by as much as  percent and the price of gasoline by as much as  a gallon” any thoughts on this statement i disagree with the strength of the statement that kennedy makes the speculators and traders who were operating in  are still operating today this article probably would not have been written in  yet the speculators are doing today what they were doing then speculators did not drive oil prices up and they did not drive it down if you believe in capitalism i think you need to have these exchanges and traders usually speculation has a negative connotation but i do not treat it that way exchanges and traders are just a part of a capitalist system if you have ever bought a stock or mutual fund you are speculating if you are buying it you think the price is going to go up if you are selling it you think it is going to go down if there are more people buying it it is going to drive the price up and if there are more people selling the price is going to be driven down so i think we are all speculators in lots of ways but obviously not to the extent that some are while oil and gas speculators make an impact they are not the main driver of prices one could argue that our dependence on fossil fuels has become crippling would you consider gas a luxury resource in other words do oil and gas as commodities bear more resemblance to wheat or lobster i very much think it bears more resemblance to wheat because it is the lifeblood of our society oil and gas is a fundamental resource but i would say that about all energy not just oil and gas energy drives the world whether it is renewables nuclear or fossil fuels i do not think that the world’s dependence on fossil fuels is crippling based on what i have read a country’s gross domestic product can be increased the quickest by using oil as compared to all other fuels the more mature the country’s economy gets the less and less it uses fossil fuels and it can begin to switch to other sources of energy it is a great way of quickly bringing up the quality of life in poorer countries there is often a disconnect between the consumers and producers of petroleum users of petroleum projects revel in the low price of oil because it means a low cost of gasoline but to those in the industry low oil price means job losses and a jeopardizing of economic security what would you recommend to close this gap in understanding boy that is something we have been trying to do for decades there are some standard industry responses to that we have not been very good as an industry at communicating our role in the economy and jobs but we are getting better i think just about anybody would say that more specifically how do you get better make it more local there are a lot of commercials and data available at the national level with states like north dakota colorado and pennsylvania seeing big developments in recent years organizations have been created in response to bridge the communication gap between industry and the public coloradans for responsible energy development for example really brings it down to the state level—here is the impact in our state individual companies can take it one step further here in colorado companies like noble energy anadarko and encana have held public meetings at the county level bringing industry employees out to the community the more local you get the better people can really see examples of oil and gas working well with the community i also think it is important to educate the public about how crude oil byproducts affect their everyday lives outside of the obvious contributions to transportation lighting heating and cooling it is making sure people understand how much of their world is built on fossil fuels young engineers make great ambassadors for the industry you know a lot even though you may not appreciate it you are an expert you need to be unafraid to speak up and politely debate the topics with people from a social responsibility perspective can hydrocarbon consumers and producers strike a balance where profit margins are met and sustainability can be achieved in other words can oil and gas companies still make money but take an active role in promoting conservation of natural resources and the pursuit of renewable energy resources i think we can achieve that balance when you are in the industry you may not pay attention to the effect of high oil prices on the economy conversely those who are not in the industry may not appreciate the tradeoff in a usd bbl world there is just no way oil and gas companies make enough money longterm but at usd bbl you can make in a sense too much money and our industry will be targeted i think there is a happy balance where we make money as companies and the greater society has a strong economy at usd bbl or usd bbl oil economies zoomed right along but i think at usd bbl oil economies started to hurt there definitely is a place where we can meet in the middle from a profitability standpoint there is a balance we have to strike in the lifestyle we lead not just in the us but in the world we cannot innovate— create the internet develop new medicines—if we are a poor society a lot of that ability to innovate stems from our access to cheap energy  for more interviews visit the way ahead speorg uses cookies to deliver
