today if your loss is due to your broker  for several producers breakeven levels are at about  per barrel almost double the current crude prices the analysts added that the oil price curve implies that crude is unlikely to rise above  per barrel for at least the next  years a slump in oil prices could force more companies into bankruptcies but production is not expected to decrease significantly as fieldlevel cash operating costs for most producers is well below  per barrel  low oil prices have exposed negligence by many stock brokers that overconcentrated positions in the oil
