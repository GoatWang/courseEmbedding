industry directory terms  conditions privacy policy how to reduce currency risks while making your exports more attractive home us world politics trade  finance labor manufacturing economy how to reduce currency risks while making your exports more attractive by peter clifford   •   monday february          topic strategies      the united states has less than  percent of the world’s population yet the world bank says the country accounts for  percent of global gdp output for years our large market satisfied the goals of american manufacturers but that has changed and when considering cia data that indicates our growth rates are lower than  other countries it becomes obvious that us companies need to seek faster growing markets abroad a portion of the world’s population is inaccessible for a variety of reasons poor local distribution channels infrastructure challenges and in rare cases sanctions etc but even when one considers the lure of potentially new markets falling manufacturing costs and the metaphorical dissolution of borders exporting is more practical and more profitable than ever it is not without risk though next stop parity first and foremost there are plenty of currency risks in the past six months the us dollar has unquestionably been the belle of the ball in global currency markets the only other significant currency of note that has even come close to matching its performance has been the swiss franc — thanks entirely to a barry bonds sized dose of performanceenhancing intervention with political turmoil in europe and relatively strong economic performance in the us one can expect this trend to continue against the euro there seems to be nothing preventing the dollar from racing back below parity a level not seen since shortly after we weathered the yk scare in fact by the time you finish reading this article we might already be through the psychologically significant level this would be on top of the near  percent gains realized since july the single currency isn’t alone similar gains have been booked against many of the dollar’s rivals as evidenced by the near  percent rise in the us dollar index according to investingcom the index represents the value of the us dollar versus a trade weighted basket of currencies as you would expect similar gains have been booked by the heavier weighted currencies in that index according to oandacom the buck has risen by  percent against the cad  percent against the jpy  percent against the gbp and was flat versus the cny you can’t win them all the move has importers and those holding “short” ie need to buy the currency euro et al positions rejoicing it has been a virtual one way street since july much to their delight the end is not near exporters however and those with an implied “long” position ie need to sell the currency are not doing as much celebrating their wares have in the past two quarters received an implied price hike of  to  percent overseas for fear of making the product less attractive to local competition overseas this often comes out of the manufacturer’s or exporter’s bottom line this trend seems set to continue all is not lost though there are tools available even to the smallest companies conducting international business these tools offer protection from foreign currency exposure be it payables or receivables forward contracts are the most common tool but futures contracts and options contracts also serve to hedge those exposures cap downside risk and barring some catastrophic event assure the buyer a set amount of proceeds upon maturity forwards and futures are very similar and relatively easy to understand the former can be customized with respect to amounts and delivery dates the latter comes with predefined terms options tend to be more complex though they generally allow for more flexibility and occasionally some upside participation one really should make an effort to understand all of the inputs and potential outcomes given the inevitable changes to those inputs just a hint the old poker adage of “look around the table if you can’t see the sucker you’re it” rings especially true here know what you are getting into just so we’re all clear the most important part of a proper hedging strategy is defining exactly what you need to hedge a us company selling domestically knows how much it can expect for its wares for a us company selling internationally things aren’t as clear invoicing in dollars seems to make sense operationally but keep in mind it might cost your customer on the other end much more in the following example for the  to be paid in installments by a customer in europe note that the customer ends up paying € thousand more than they would have in the presence of a hedge invoicing in local currency alleviates the administrative burden from the customer and makes importing more attractive but it doesn’t solve the problem the unhedged euro position is worth  thousand less in the absence of a hedge at the time of settlement both examples assume a deal date of june  with  percent due july   percent due october  and the  percent balance due january  you win some you win some more another often overlooked advantage of some of these tools is that they tend to keep your cash flow free though not immune to deposits premiums or margin which typically only amount to a fraction of the notional value of the hedge you only need to pay for them when they mature or in the case of options if they are executed regardless of which side of the market you are on and regardless of the direction of the underlying exchange rate having an appropriate hedge in place is key all well and good to avoid downside risk but what of missing out on the upside if you have owned a home in the past  to  years you know that no rally lasts forever there will be periods of sharp dollar declines too you can take that to the bank much less certain — and infinitely more important is the timing of these declines from the exporter perspective it would be difficult to see these potential “gains” slipping away because you had hedged your revenues ahead of time to this i would say serendipity is not a sustainable business model yes you might be missing out on what you perceive to be “gains” but unless you are a currency trader at a bank or hedge fund your “gains” should be made on running your business growing sales and realizing efficiencies in your operations — things within your control executive board rooms cheer efficiencies in their own operations not stumbling into revenues because certain factors well beyond their control conspire to work in their favor once or twice they celebrate and reward proper risk management strategies hedging is perhaps the most important risk management strategy that an importer or exporter can deploy tweet share about the author peter cliffordpeter clifford is the cofounder of trsry llc an early stage financial
