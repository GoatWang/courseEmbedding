published in  it is a word for word updating of the king james in language that any normal  year old can read no greater riches can be put in youths hands than the riches contained in this book every godbreathed word is in these volumes for the first time since it was written nearly two thousand years ago every word is being given to young men and ladies broken down into their own language now for the first time the fruit of the spirit of god is offered to young readers so that they can gather its fruit for themselves and what glorious fruit it is the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faith meekness selfcontrol and everlasting life see galatians   is there anyone that does not desire such fruit as this in their life and future is not happiness itself bound up in these things and more is not the reading of the bible the only hope of living forever for god has said this is life everlasting that they should know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou didst send and how shall they know him faith comes by hearing and haring by the word of god the reading of the bible is their only hope but it is a blessed hope indeed in providing this bible for children our purpose has been to do our utmost toward giving the young people of our day the opportunity to have a good life here and a far better life hereafter there has never been a time when so much interest was shown in the welfare of our young people we see teeming sunday schools busy vacation bible schools active child evangelism organizations and the most zealous effort to educate children ever mounted by the people of any society yet with all this sincere and welldirected effort one of the most important things of all has not been available until now  the bible in a language the child can read and understand now for the first time in history these hardworking loving people have a textbook from which to teach these young learners both grace and knowledge  the childrens king james bible why must they have the bible in their own language do we not go to great expense in our grade schools to provide textbooks which will teach our youth what they need to know quickly and fully do we give them textbooks in adult language of course not the what about the book of books what about the knowledge of god shall we continue to teach the most important subject of all in language the children do not understand what teacher wants to teach from a book which the children cannot even read for themselves but in this age of personal choice let the child tell you for themselves if they prefer to learn the words of life in language they can neither pronounce nor read nor understand do not think that our children desire to be deprived of love peace joy kindness goodness faith and everlasting life no indeed they want to live life at its fullest anyone who has ever looked into their intent eager young faces can tell you that they thirst for knowledge  and they drink it in when they are taught in language they can understand of course there is no greater knowledge no more desirable wisdom no sweeter joy than that of our god and savior jesus christ jay p

court of appeals of mississippi evelyn kay manning appellant v sunbeamoster household products and national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh pa appellees no wccoa     decided april   before myers pj irving and ishee jjlester clark nathan lester clark lexington attorneys for appellant matthew jason sumrall attorney for appellees ¶  in october  evelyn kay manning suffered a back injury while working at a manufacturing plant owned and operated by sunbeamoster household products employer   manning filed a petition to controvert   initially all of mannings medical treatment including treatment for her psychological issues was covered and paid for by the employers insurance provider national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh pa carrier¶  after a lengthy course of treatment extending over a period of more than nine years covering a range of physical and mental problems and involving more than twentythree different physicians mannings claim was finally evaluated by an administrative law judge in october    the administrative law judge concluded that manning had a compensable claim for some of the treatment she received   however the administrative law judge also concluded that an elective surgery performed in february  and all treatment related to her physical problem after that  surgery were noncompensable and that all her psychological care was noncompensable   the administrative law judges decision was later affirmed by the full mississippi workers compensation commission commission and the circuit court of forrest county¶  aggrieved manning appeals   the assignments of error manning raises on appeal can be reduced to the following issues   whether the administrative law judge applied the correct burden of proof   whether the administrative law judge correctly weighed the medical evidence   whether substantial evidence supports the administrative law judges finding that the surgery of february  and all subsequent treatment for her physical injury is noncompensable  and  whether substantial evidence supports the administrative law judges finding that all treatment for her psychological issues is noncompensable¶  finding no error we affirm the judgment of the circuit courtfacts and procedural history¶  on october   manning suffered a back injury lifting a “tote” while working on an assembly line at a plant belonging to her employer   over the course of the next nine years manning was treated by more than twentythree different physicians for a variety of physical and mental problems allegedly stemming from her back injury   her treatment began the week after she injured her back during which she visited dr kim puckett a chiropractor complaining of severe lower back pain   on november   manning went to a clinic in hattiesburg and was treated by dr bruce mccarthy an orthopedic surgeon   dr mccarthy recommended bedrest and prescribed antiinflammatories and muscle relaxants   an xray taken during that visit revealed no acute injury   manning underwent an mri later that month which revealed a central disc bulge at l but no evidence of nerve root or canal compromise   dr mccarthy continued to recommend a course of antiinflammatories muscle relaxants and bedrest¶  on november   manning saw another orthopedic surgeon dr claude williams in new orleans   dr williams noted that manning demonstrated no abnormal neurological findings upon examination  but she nevertheless recommended a trial of epidural steroid injections which manning received¶  in july  an independent medical examination was conducted by dr richard buckley a neurosurgeon at the request of the employer and the carrier   dr buckley reviewed the mri taken in hattiesburg finding that the bulge at l was deterioration consistent with mannings age   he concluded that there was no objective abnormality in mannings condition and that manning was suffering from no neurologic deficit¶  in september  manning was seen by dr bertha blanchard a neurologist   dr blanchard concluded that manning might have a possible left lumbosacral radiculopathy and she recommended that manning undergo a myelogram a bone scan and emgncs testing all of which were performed¶  later that same month another independent medical examination was conducted by dr robert manolakas a physical medicine specialist   after examining manning dr manolakas reported that his testing revealed multiple signs of exaggerations and inconsistencies in mannings complaints   he concluded that there was no evidence that manning was suffering from radiculopathy nerve root damage or nerve root embarrassment   he also found that manning was at maximum medical improvement and there was no need for further testing¶    in november  manning underwent an independent psychiatric evaluation conducted by dr henry maggio at the request of the employer and the carrier   dr maggio concluded that manning had an adjustment disorder and chronic depression   he also stated that her psychological condition was not causally related to her work injury but her psychological problems might be resulting in some form of symptom magnification¶    over the course of the next eight years manning was seen by a number of different physicians who conducted a wide variety of different tests and offered various diagnoses for mannings continuing back pain   the conclusions of these physicians might best be summarized as follows   some of the physical and internal medical specialists concluded that mannings pain was legitimate and could be treated with surgery or other techniques   others concluded that she exhibited no abnormal signs was at maximum medical recovery and could return to work   these opinions were not evenly split among physicians selected by the employer and the carrier and the physicians selected by manning   almost all of the psychologists and psychiatrists seen by manning diagnosed her with severe mental and emotional trauma including personality disorder with histrionic and schizoid traits avoidant personality disorder anxiety disorder and chronic major depression   most of the mental health professionals concluded that these mental problems were exacerbating if not causing her pain symptoms   most concluded that mannings psychological problems predated her work injury¶    finally in february  manning underwent an elective lower back surgery for l discogenic disease conducted by dr lee after the surgery manning continued to report that she was in pain and in june  she was treated by dr jeffrey summers a pain management specialist as part of an independent medical examination ordered by the commission   dr summers concluded that manning had no neurologic deficit and that any further surgical treatment was “doomed to failure”   an additional commissionordered independent medical exam was conducted by dr rahul vohra in february    dr vohra concluded that manning had a somatoform disorder with preexisting depression and anxiety   he also found that further medical intervention had no chance of providing any greater relief to manning due to her preexisting mental health issuesstandard of review ¶    in cases involving orders of the mississippi workers compensation commission the commission sits as finder of fact and its findings are entitled to substantial deference  raytheon aerospace support servs v miller  sod   ¶  miss   therefore we will not interfere with the findings of the commission unless those findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record  id at ¶    additionally “the commission is also the ultimate judge of the credibility of witnesses”  barber seafood inc v smith  sod   ¶  miss citation omitted   when the evidence presented by witnesses on a particular issue is conflicting we are not empowered to determine where the preponderance of evidence lies  id instead “this court must affirm the decision of the commission where substantial credible evidence supports the commissions order”  iddiscussion and analysis  the administrative law judge applied the correct burden of proof¶    manning asserts that the administrative law judge instead of applying a burden of proof based on preponderance of the evidence or clear and convincing evidence should have applied a burden of proof based on a substantial evidence standard   however in doing so manning has confused the issues of the correct burden of proof to be applied by the administrative law judge and the standard of review applied by this court on appeal ¶   “in a workers compensation case the claimant bears the burden of proving by a ‘fair preponderance of the evidence’ each element of the claim”  hedge v leggett  platt inc  sod   miss citing bracey v packard elec div gen motors co  sod   miss   thus the correct burden of proof for the administrative law judge to apply in this case would have been a burden based on the preponderance of the evidence and this was in fact the burden applied during the administrative hearing   as noted above under our standard of review in cases such as this we defer to the findings of the administrative law judge and the full commission so long as those findings are supported by “substantial evidence”   the substantial evidence standard therefore is not a burden of proof to be applied by the administrative law judge in the original hearing but a factor used by appellate courts in reviewing the decisions reached in administrative proceedings  the administrative law judge correctly weighed the medical evidence¶    both sides in this case have engaged in an argument over an issue that they frame as one involving the proper degree of deference an administrative law judge should give to a treating physician   manning argues that an administrative law judge when faced with opinions from two equally competent physicians should defer to the “treating physician” relying primarily on south central bell telephone co v aden  sod  miss   the employer and the carrier argue against this proposition primarily citing to spann v walmart stores inc  sod  miss and hardaway co v bradley  sod  miss ¶    both sides however confuse the issue on this point   the question of deference that they attempt to address is better framed as one of deference to a patientselected physician over a physician selected by the employer and the carrier rather than deference to a treating physician over a nontreating physician   although the workers compensation statute gives the claimant the right to select their primary physician it never refers to that physician as a “treating” physician and we see no reason why a physician examining a patient in an independent medical examination requested by an employer or a carrier is not “treating” the patient   therefore we reject this distinction between treating and nontreating physicians¶    furthermore after a close reading of aden at no place can this court find language that attempts to set out a rule whereby all other things being equal an administrative law judge is required to defer to the opinion of a patientselected or “treating” physician   however we are mindful that this is not the first time this issue has been presented to the court framed in this manner   see richardson v johnson elec auto inc  sod  missctapp   the following analysis is provided to offer guidance on this issue¶    in aden a woman in her midthirties suffered a back injury while working for the telephone company  aden  sod at    she filed a workers compensation claim and after a hearing by an administrative law judge she was found to be permanently disabled  id at    the administrative law judge heard testimony from two physicians  id at    one of which dr browning was patientselected and had examined the claimant on numerous occasions  id the other physician dr yerger was employerselected and examined the patient only once or twice  id the patientselected physician concluded that the woman was permanently disabled  the employerselected physician that she was not permanently disabled  id in appealing the finding of the administrative law judge the employer and the carrier argued that the evidence presented by the physician they selected should control since he examined the woman at a later time than dr browning the patientselected physician  id at ¶    in upholding the decision of the administrative law judge which admittedly favored the evidence presented by the patientselected physician the mississippi supreme court stated thatwe regard the testimony of dr yerger visavis the testimony of dr browning as each constituting admissible medical opinions which were submitted to the triers of facts the members of the mississippi workmens sic compensation commission   the commission was charged with the responsibility under our law for weighing and evaluating this testimony and all other testimony before and making a finding   the net effect of the commissions fact finding in this regard was that dr yergers testimony was simply not credible   the fact that it was admissible testimony and the fact that dr yerger examined the claimant last in no way serves to undercut the commissions findingid at  emphasis added   contrary to mannings assertions the language above in no way suggests that in the face of equally competent medical testimony an administrative law judge is required to defer to a “treating” or patientselected physician although the administrative law judge and later the full commission did rely on the testimony of the patientselected physician they did so simply because the only competing testimony from employerselected physicians was judged to lack all credibility id manning is therefore incorrect in her assertions that aden requires the administrative law judge to defer to the physicians she selected in the instant case¶    the cases cited by the employer and the carrier provide further support for this conclusion   in spann an employee of walmart suffered a back injury while carrying a tire  spann  sod at  ¶    he was seen by dr john frenz an orthopedic surgeon who recommended he undergo laparoscopic back surgery for a disc displacement  id the employee was later examined by dr elmer nix another orthopedic surgeon who concluded that the disc displacement was within normal limits  id at ¶    however dr nix also stated that he had not reviewed the workers mri and his answers were uncertain because he had only seen the employee one time  id finally the worker saw an additional orthopedic surgeon dr patrick barrett who diagnosed the disc displacement as a problem but he concluded that the recommended surgery would provide a less than fiftypercent chance that the employee would be able to return to his earlier duties  id at ¶ ¶    an administrative law judge the full commission and this court all denied the employees claim for compensation for the laparoscopic back surgery   the supreme court reversed those decisions holding thatwalmart is obligated pursuant to the act to allow spann to have the surgery recommended by dr frenz the primary treating physician   dr barrett states that in his opinion having seen spann on a limited basis that there is only a  chance the laparoscopic surgery will allow spann to return to heavy work and he does not express an opinion as to whether or not this surgery would relieve spanns pain   only dr nix ․ took the position that surgery was unnecessary or would not be beneficial to spanns recoveryspann  sod at  ¶    although the supreme court referred to dr frenz as the “primary treating physician” and sided with his conclusions this opinion merely confirms our basic standard of review in all workers compensation cases   we defer to the decisions of the administrative law judge and the commission when those decisions are supported by substantial credible evidence   in spann the decisions of the administrative law judge and the commission to deny compensation for the surgery in the view of the supreme court were not supported by substantial credible evidence   in fact the court clarified its conclusion in spann in the more recent hardaway case statingspann was not given the surgery simply because his treating physician prescribed it but because the commission was not presented with any other credible evidence to the contrary   in spann the only difference between the two credible witnesses were that one felt surgery was necessary and the other thought there was a  chance that surgery would be beneficialhardaway  sod at  ¶    in keeping with the substantial evidence standard of review the supreme court reversed the decisions of the administrative law judge the commission and this court in spann not because those decisions failed to defer to a “treating” physician but because they were not supported by substantial credible evidence¶    finally the supreme courts decision in hardaway provides a direct rebuke to mannings argument on the proper deference that must be given to a patientselected physician   in hardaway a worker named harvey bradley was injured when wet cement fell on his head  hardaway  sod at  ¶    he initially saw the now familiar dr frenz who eventually concluded that bradley needed surgery  id at ¶    at the request of his employer bradley was also examined once by dr lon alexander and four times by dr howard katz who both concluded that surgery was unnecessary  id at  ¶¶    an administrative law judge later issued an order denying compensation for the surgery an order which was affirmed by the commission but reversed by the circuit court and this court  id at  ¶ ¶    in reversing the decision of the circuit court and this court the supreme court stated that “here with the testimony of two physicians who conducted independent medical examinations the commissions decision was supported by more than a scintilla of evidence   therefore ‘substantial evidence’ supporting the commissions decision was present”  id at  ¶    in fact the supreme court reversed those decisions granting compensation for the surgery even while agreeing with the administrative law judges finding that “dr frenz treated claimant more often over a longer period of time than dr alexander and dr katz․” id the supreme courts ruling in hardaway clearly indicates that administrative law judges are not required to defer to “treating” or patientselected physicians when they are presented with credible countervailing evidence   therefore we find mannings argument on the issue of the proper weight to be given to the testimony of “treating” or patientselected physicians to be contrary to the prevailing law in this state and this assignment of error to be without merit¶    as a final aside on this issue we note that the employer and the carrier have expressed concern over recent orders of the commission in which they have seemingly adopted the rule manning urges us to apply in this case   specifically the employer and the carrier quote from a recent decision of the commission alexander v forest hill nursing center inc mwcc no  h sept   in which the commission stated “if the evidence presented is equivocal or equally credible that is two or more competent physicians simply disagree about the efficacy of the contemplated procedure then deference must be provided to the claimants treating physician”  id given our discussion above it should be clear that any such rule is contrary to the current law a conclusion the commission itself may have already reached as there is some dispute over whether it followed the rule set out in alexander in the instant case   regardless however of whether the commission followed the rule in this case the language quoted from alexander above is an incorrect statement of the law in this state  substantial evidence supports the administrative law judges findings that physical treatment past february  is noncompensable ¶    manning argues that the orders of the administrative law judge and the commission denying her compensation for the surgery performed by dr lee in february  and all subsequent treatment for her physical problem excluding examinations ordered by the commission were not supported by substantial evidence and should be reversed by this court¶    in the order denying compensation the administrative law judge relied primarily on the findings of dr michael fromke dr mccarthy dr williams dr buckley and dr manolakas   it noted that dr fromke concluded that manning had reached maximum medical improvement on may   with no permanent medical impairment or work restrictions related to the injury   the order also noted that at the time of dr fromkes diagnosis dr mccarthy and dr williams had both diagnosed a disc bulge at l and neither had recommended surgery   furthermore the order stated that dr buckley had concluded that manning had no true objective abnormality and no neurological deficit and dr manolakas had determined that there was a very poor correlation between mannings subjective complaints and his objective findings ¶    the conclusions of the physicians listed above provide more than enough substantial credible evidence that manning did not require the surgery performed by dr lee in february  or any further treatment past that point   under our standard of review in this case we cannot judge the individual credibility of each physician   if the decisions of the administrative law judge and the commission are supported by substantial credible evidence we must defer to those decisions   in this case there clearly exists substantial evidence sufficient to support a finding that manning did not require the surgery of february  or any further treatment for her back injury   accordingly we find mannings argument that the decisions of the administrative law judge and the commission were not supported by substantial evidence to be without merit  substantial evidence supports the administrative law judges finding that psychological treatment is noncompensable ¶    finally manning argues that the orders of the administrative law judge and the commission denying her compensation for treatment related to her psychological problems were not supported by substantial evidence and we should reverse those decisions¶    during the administrative hearing manning admitted on crossexamination that she suffered fairly severe mental trauma as a child   she was frequently whipped and beaten by both her mother and father   she was sexually abused by her brotherinlaw as a young child   she was raped at the age of fourteen by a man she later married   she revealed much of the same information to several of the psychologists and psychiatrists who examined her in connection with this case¶    in support of the order denying compensation for mannings psychological treatment the administrative law judge relied on the facts about her abusive childhood revealed during crossexamination and to her treating physicians   the administrative law judge also relied on the opinions of dr henry maggio dr james brister and dr ed anderson   dr maggio a psychiatrist who saw manning many times between  and  concluded that manning had underlying psychiatric problems stemming from her childhood abuse unrelated to her work injury including a personality disorder with histrionic and dependent traits an adjustment disorder and chronic depression   dr brister stated that he could not relate her depression and other psychological symptoms to her back injury   dr anderson diagnosed a schizoid personality disorder with avoidant features and stated these problems were fairly pronounced and were
