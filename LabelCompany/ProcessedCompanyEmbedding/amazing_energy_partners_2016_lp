newsletters most profitable oil and gas companies of  pspx tep by ryan downie  august   —  am edt share profitability can be measured in multiple ways net income is expressed as an absolute dollar amount while profit margins are expressed as a percentage of revenue profits are also often adjusted to reflect nonrecurring events though generally accepted accounting principles have more rigid standards for profit calculation the midstream business model tends to allow higher margins than other portions of the energy supply chain so large midstream pureplays are generally the highestmargin businesses in the sector philips  partners lp nyse pspx tallgrass energy partners lp nyse tep and genesis energy lp nyse gel have some of the highest profit margins in the business for companies that derive revenues from providing products and services major integrated oil and gas firms such as exxon mobil corporation nyse xom and chevron corporation nyse cvx produce massive profits due to their scale phillips  partners lp phillips  partners is a master limited partnership mlp that owns and operates midstream operations such as pipeline systems that transport crude oil liquid natural gas and refined products phillips  nyse psx formed the company in  to manage its pipelines terminals and other transportation assets phillips  partners had a  net margin over the month period that ended in june  resulting in  million in net profits since  the mlps net margin has fluctuated between  and  though it has usually fallen between  and  analysts are calling for  revenue growth and  earnings per share eps growth in  so margins should compress despite rising profits genesis energy lp genesis energy lp is another mlp created to manage midstream assets and provide logistics services the company has an extensive pipeline system servicing customers across diverse locations in the united states the companys net margin was  over the month period that ended in june  though this was the highest level achieved in the past decade net income of  million is also the highest for any month period over the year span analyst forecasts call for  eps expansion for the full year  despite contraction on the top line so both profits and margins should rise in  for genesis tallgrass energy partners lp tallgrass energy partners is another mlp that owns and operates midstream assets generating most of its revenue from transportation services it also generates a smaller portion of revenue from selling oil and natural gas products and processing services tallgrass had a  net margin over the month period that ended in june  resulting in  of net income net margin has been as high as  in  and as low as  in  but it has generally stayed between  and  analysts forecast  sales growth and  eps growth in  so both profits and margins are expected to rise exxon mobil exxon mobil is the largest us energy company in terms of market cap revenues and volume produced the companys impressive scale leads to exceptionally high profits though the business model leads to substantially lower margins than those enjoyed by midstream firms this has been especially true in  when crude oil prices approached their lowest levels in roughly a decade exxon mobil managed  net margin over the  months ended june  which is the lowest level of the past decade net margin was as high as  during that span despite this dip exxon mobil still generated  billion in net profits eps is expected to fall  yearoveryear in  as low energy prices wreak havoc on earnings but similar pain is being felt by other firms across the sector chevron chevron is the secondlargest us diversified oil and gas company and it is influenced by the same fundamental drivers as exxon mobil the companys  net margin over the  months that ended in june  was the lowest of the past decade during which time margins often fell between  and  this precipitous fall still yielded  billion in net profits and analysts are forecasting improvements in

enterprise products partners lp buy the dip  the motley fool skip to main content the motley fool foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search enterprise products partners lp buy the dip after a big run leading into  enterprise products partners is off around  from its high should you be buying this dip reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer jun   at am enterprise products partners lp nyseepd is one of the largest oil and natural gas midstream partnerships in the country and its shares have fallen roughly  since hitting a peak in february is it time for you to start adding this industry giant to your portfolio the numbers say yes here are six things you need to know before you pull the trigger  scale enterprise is one of the largest midstream companies in the united states that means growth will be slower than at a smaller industry player but it also means the partnership can take on deals and projects that not many of its peers could handle so scale has its advantages image source getty images enterprise is also one of the most diversified midstream names partially a function of its size it owns pipelines storage facilities products terminals processing plants and even a fleet of ships it has assets spread across a huge swatch of the country that means if one product it moves or regional area is under pressure enterprise has the flexibility to adjust its business to deal with the issue    throughput not commodities the vast majority of enterprises business is feebased this point isnt unique to enterprise for example holly energy partners gets  of its revenues from fees but it is still an important reason for owning enterprise essentially a feebased business means that the price of oil and natural gas has a limited impact on enterprises business demand is a much more important determinant of success to give you an idea of what this means oil prices tumbled in mid and still hadnt fully recovered by year end  but over that span enterprises core distributable cash flow grew from  billion to  billion thats not amazing growth but it happened at a time when oil prices fell from over  a barrel to around  at the worst point withstanding that kind of price drop highlights the value of enterprises business model even if it isnt unique   enterprises results held up well even during a deep oil downturn image source enterprise products partners lp  buying growth another benefit of enterprises size is that it allows the midstream giant to make big moves in down markets for example it completed the acquisition of its oil tankers business in early  while oil prices were still falling and more recently it bought the midstream assets of azure midstream partners at a bankruptcy auction both show enterprises ability to expand its business opportunistically in downturns so it can come out the other side a stronger company of course downturns arent the only time it expands this way but the ability to take a contrarian stance is a key differentiating factor that said to give you a broader sense of the companys history enterprise has spent  billion on acquisitions since its initial public offering in   a builder while acquisitions are an important piece of the growth equation for enterprise it isnt the only thing to watch construction is another key avenue for growth on that front the partnership has  billion of growth projects in the works between now and    enterprise is building its business from the ground up image source enterprise products partners lp image httpphxcorporateirnetexternalfileitemugfyzwsuqnjczmtufenoawxksuqmzgwotqffrcgumqt page  size is important here too because enterprise can comfortably take on projects that smaller peers dont have the scale to get done in fact enterprise has spent around  billion on organic growth projects since it came public far more than its spent on acquisitions    good quarter that said you might be asking whats going on today at enterprise motley fools tyler crowe recently highlighted the good news here in the first quarter enterprise saw nice jumps in net income earnings and distributable cash flow year over year and sequentially compared to the fourth quarter all three had been in something of a holding pattern during the oil downturn with new assets offsetting slow demand for existing assets   with drilling activity picking up in the united states however enterprises expansion efforts are really starting to show results assuming this trend continues the partnership should have a pretty good year  distribution all of this leads to a discussion of the partnerships distribution which is likely what attracted you to enterprise in the first place for starters it offers a robust  distribution yield thats toward the high end of its historical range the distribution was covered by  times in the first quarter which provides plenty of safety and room for future increases   note that the distribution was increased by  in the quarter marking the st consecutive quarter in which enterprise has upped the disbursement however the longer streak is   the number of consecutive years that enterprise has increased its distribution if you like dividend increases enterprise has you covered   would there be a bad time to buy all in enterprise is likely among the bestrun participants in the oil and natural gas midstream industry in fact some might argue that theres never a bad time to buy this limited partnership for longterm investors seeking income thats hyperbole of course but today after a  pullback is certainly not a bad time with a wellcovered  distribution yield and two decades worth of dividend growth behind it investors would be well served to do a deep dive here reuben brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends enterprise products partners the motley fool has a disclosure policy author reuben

fluctuate with the mlps operating or business performance mlps typically have a general partner that maintains an aggregate  general partner interest unit holders will have limited voting rights and do not own an interest in vote with or control the general partner the general partner often cannot be removed without its own consent and the general partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of unit holders the mlp may issue additional common units diluting existing unit holders’ interests unit holders may be required to pay taxes on income from the mlp even if they do not receive cash distributions the irs could reclassify the mlp as a taxable entity which could reduce the cash available for distribution to unit holders if at any time the gp owns  or more of the issued and outstanding limited partner interests the gp will have the right to purchase all of the limited partnership interests not held by the gp at a price that may be undesirable mlp tax considerations the tax treatment for investors in mlps is different than that of an investment in stock including a the

likely to be a highly profitable investmentthere is potential for  gains over a year periodwithout an overload of information i will portray facts and reasons for investing in ngl energy partners lp ngl the past couple of months have been horrid for investors because of the significant drop in price has occurred but moving ahead there are reasons to be optimistic business overview ngl energy partners lp purchases propane butane and other natural gas liquids from refiners processing plants producers and other parties and sells the product to retailers refiners and other participants in wholesale markets ngl is a master limited partnership or mlp with a diverse group of growing businesses which pays a quarterly dividend of  cents ngl has  business groups  water solutions retail propane crude logistics liquids and refined products ngl provides services for the energy industry and generally is paid on a fixedfee basis however in some segments  especially liquids refined products and retail propane  ngl takes title to products and resells them at a markup source for both charts summary from latest annual report  total stockholders equity  billion market cap is  billion the last price of the stock was  ngl energy partners lp purchases propane butane and other natural gas liquids from refiners processing plants producers and other parties and sells the product to retailers refiners and other participants in wholesale markets total stockholders equity has increased from  billion in  to  billion in  ngl has  million in cash from latest annual report in  the company has  billion in longterm debt and shortterm debt is  million in  the company had  billion in longterm debt and shortterm debt was  million the companys revenue increased in  fiscal year ends in march to  billion from  billion in  net income in  was  million net loss in  was  million ngl energy partners has spent  million on dividends in  ngl currently pays  in distributions per year for a yield of   is certainly going to be better than fiscal  according to analysts ngl should increase its distribution to at least  cents per quarter  per year the  dividend is covered and the growth projects ensure that the numbers will be moving up in fiscal  fiscal  will be better because the fiscal year  did not include the full earnings power of the grand mesa and murphy oil acquisitions for fy  ngl expects to generate adjusted ebitda of mm including m ebitda for the grand mesa pipeline fy  capex is projected at mm source ngl energy partners lp preferred ngl energy partners lp has just issued a preferred stock the stock will be  class b fixedtofloating rate cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units the preferred unit trades as nglb and currently trades slightly below par at  dividend i expect ngl to go exdividend around the first of august with a  cent dividend a yield currently at a little over  opinion about the company fundamentally i believe ngl to be a good company and in the future we can expect promising growth the fourth quarter ending march   was extremely weak an abnormally warm winter led to a decrease in propane sales the majority of investors expected a dividend increase in  but that now looks unlikely after the weak fourth quarter and lack of a dividend increase the unit price declined from the low s to a low of  the last two weeks have seen a steady increase to a close of  on july rd ngl data by ycharts taxes ngl issues a k which many investors despise such securities are usually recommended to be held in a taxable account this is definitely something to discuss with a tax advisor i am not one risks among the key risk factors that may affect their consolidated financial position and results are the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids gasoline diesel ethanol and even biodiesel energy prices in general will have an effect ngl has a substantial amount of total debt partly including inventory but i expect them to be able to reduce their debt gradually there is a high probability that another drop in share price could occur if you are reading this you are probably aware this is a volatile time in the oil and gas sector propane is also a large factor for ngl uso data by ycharts technical analysis when we take a look at the threeyear chart we can see that the price dropped from  to under  and started to rise we can see a strong downtrend which has been broken on this chart i marked resistance and support levels the support levels of  and  represent resistance if the price jumps above  it would be a buy signal and the price could easily rise to  rising above  supports the continuation of a bullish trend overview efficiently for the upcoming period if the price falls below  it would be a strong sell signal and the price could easily drop to  source conclusion my opinion is that ngl is well positioned for the future and is likely to be a highly profitable investment ngl currently pays  in distributions per year for a yield of  and  is certainly going to be better than fiscal  it wouldnt surprise me if ngl increases its distribution to at least  cents per quarter  per year next year the  dividend is covered and the growth projects ensure that the numbers will be moving up in fiscal  ngl reported fq earnings and revenues the latter rising  yy to b vs the b analyst consensus ngl says adjusted ebitda totaled m for q and m for fy  lower than the m for q  and m for fy  for fy  ngl expects to generate adjusted ebitda of mm including m ebitda for the grand mesa pipeline this pipeline is projected to make  million per month in ebitda at its current price ngl is an excellent longterm investment with a very generous yield and solid growth prospects if the price falls any price in the range of  to  is an excellent opportunity to invest in ngl and investors could certainly earn at least  within the next two years disclosure i amwe are long ngl i wrote this article myself and it
