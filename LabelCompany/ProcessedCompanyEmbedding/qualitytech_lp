forwardlooking statements this form k contains standalone audited and unaudited financial statements and other financial data for each of qts and the operating partnership we believe it is important to show both qts and the operating partnerships financial statements and for investors to understand the few differences between them in the context of how qts and the operating partnership operate as a consolidated company see explanatory note for an explanation of these few differences since the financial data presented in this item  does not contain any differences between qts and the operating partnership all periods presented reflect the operating results of the operating partnership overview we are a leading owner developer and operator of stateoftheart carrierneutral multitenant data centers our data centers are facilities that house the network and computer equipment of multiple customers and provide access to a range of communications carriers we have a fully integrated platform through which we own and operate our data centers and provide a broad range of it infrastructure solutions we refer to our spectrum of core data center products as our cs which consists of custom data center colocation and cloud and managed services we believe that we own and operate one of the largest portfolios of multitenant data centers in the united states as measured by gross square footage and have the capacity to nearly double our leased raised floor without constructing or acquiring any new buildings we operate a portfolio of  data centers located throughout the united states canada europe and the asia within the us we are located in some of the top us data center markets plus other highgrowth markets our data centers are highly specialized fullservice missioncritical facilities used by our customers to house power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support their most critical business processes we believe that our data centers are bestinclass and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers providing fully redundant highdensity power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of major national and international companies and organizations this is in part reflected by our operating track record of fivenines  reliability and by our diverse customer base of more than  customers including financial institutions healthcare companies government agencies communications service providers software companies and global internet companies qts is a maryland corporation formed on may   and is the sole general partner and majority owner of qualitytech lp our operating partnership substantially all of our assets are held by and our operations are conducted through the operating partnership qts class a common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol qts as of december   qts owned an approximate  ownership interest in the operating partnership the operating partnership is a delaware limited partnership formed on august   and was qts historical predecessor prior to the ipo having operated the companys business until the ipo we believe that qts has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit commencing with its taxable year ended december   our qualification as a reit and maintenance of such qualification depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis various complex requirements under the code relating to among other things the sources of our gross income the composition and values of our assets our distributions to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our equity shares table of contents our customer base we provide data center solutions to a diverse set of customers our customer base is comprised of companies of all sizes representing an array of industries each with unique and varied business models and needs we serve fortune  companies as well as small and mediumsized businesses or smbs including financial institutions healthcare companies government agencies communications service providers software companies and global internet companies our custom data center or c customers typically are large enterprises with significant it expertise and specific it requirements including financial institutions big four accounting firms and the worlds largest global internet companies our colocation or c customers consist of a wide range of organizations including major healthcare telecommunications and software and webbased companies our c cloud customers include both large organizations and smbs seeking to reduce their capital expenditures and outsource their it infrastructure on a flexible basis examples of current c cloud customers include a global financial processing company and various us government agencies as a result of our diverse customer base customer concentration in our portfolio is limited as of december   only three of our more than  customers individually accounted for more than  of our monthly recurring revenue mrr as defined below with only one greater than  which accounted for approximately  of our mrr in addition approximately  of our mrr was attributable to customers who use more than one of our cs products our portfolio we develop and operate  data centers located throughout the united states canada europe and asia containing an aggregate of approximately  million gross square feet of space approximately  of which is wholly owned by us including approximately  million basisofdesign raised floor square feet which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities this represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full buildout depending on the configuration that we deploy we build out our data center facilities for both general use colocation and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power depending on the needs of each facility at that time as of december   this space included approximately  raised floor operating net rentable square feet or nrsf plus approximately  million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline of which approximately  nrsf is expected to become operational by december   of the total  million nrsf in our development pipeline none was related to customer leases which had been executed as of december   but not yet commenced our facilities collectively have access to over  megawatts mw of gross utility power with  mw of available utility power we believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment key operating metrics the following sets forth definitions for our key operating metrics these metrics may differ from similar definitions used by other companies monthly recurring revenue mrr we calculate mrr as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date which includes revenue from our c c and c rental and cloud and managed services activities but excludes customer recoveries deferred setup fees variable related revenues noncash revenues and other onetime revenues mrr does not include the impact from bookednotbilled leases as of a particular date unless otherwise specifically noted mrr does not reflect any accounting associated with any free rent rent abatements or future scheduled rent increases and also excludes operating expense and power reimbursements annualized rent we define annualized rent as mrr multiplied by  rental churn we define rental churn as the mrr lost in the period from a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total mrr at the beginning of the period leasable raised floor we define leasable raised floor as the amount of raised floor square footage that we have leased plus the available capacity of raised floor square footage that is in a leasable format as of a particular date and according to a particular product configuration the amount of our leasable raised floor may change even without completion of new redevelopment projects due to changes in our configuration of c c and c product space table of contents percentage  occupied and billing raised floor we define percentage occupied and billing raised floor as the square footage that is subject to a signed lease for which billing has commenced as of a particular date compared to leasable raised floor as of that date expressed as a percentage bookednotbilled we define bookednotbilled as our customer leases that have been signed but for which lease payments have not yet commenced factors that may influence future results of operations and cash flows recent accounting pronouncements we plan to adopt the provisions of asc topic  leases and asc topic  revenue from contracts with customers effective january   for additional information with respect to the impact of the standards on our financial condition and results of operations refer to item  revenue our revenue growth will depend on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of leasable raised floor lease currently available space lease new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development and redevelopment activities attract new customers and continue to meet the ongoing technological requirements of our customers as of december   we had in place customer leases generating revenue for approximately  of our leasable raised floor our ability to grow revenue also will be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental cloud and managed services rates at our properties future economic downturns regional downturns or downturns in the technology industry new technological developments evolving industry demands and other similar factors described above under risk factors could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers leases on favorable terms or at all and could adversely affect our customers ability to meet their obligations to us negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods which would impact our results of operations and cash flows we also at times may elect to reclaim space from customers in a negotiated transaction where we believe that we can redevelop andor release that space at higher rates which may cause a decrease in revenue until the space is released leasing arrangements as of december    of our mrr came from customers which individually occupied greater than or equal to  square feet of space or approximately  mw of power as of december   approximately  of our mrr was attributable to the metered power model under the metered power model the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount plus reimbursement of certain other operating costs including actual costs of submetered electricity used to power its data center equipment and an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center expressed as a factor of the customers actual electricity usage fluctuations in our customers utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows under the metered power model these leases generally have a minimum term of five years as of december    of our mrr was leased to customers which individually occupied less than  square feet of space as of december   approximately  of our mrr was attributable to the gross lease model under a gross lease the customer pays us a fixed rent on a monthly basis and does not separately reimburse us for operating costs including utilities maintenance repair property taxes and insurance as reimbursement for these costs is factored into mrr however if customers incur more utility costs than their leases permit we are able to charge these customers for overages for leases under the gross lease model fluctuations in our customers utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us will impact our results of operations and cash flows our leases on a gross lease basis generally have a term of three years or less scheduled lease expirations our ability to minimize rental churn and customer downgrades at renewal and renew lease and release expiring space will impact our results of operations and cash flows leases which have commenced billing representing approximately  and  of our total leased raised floor are scheduled to expire during the years ending december   including all monthtomonth leases and  respectively these leases also represented approximately  and  respectively of our annualized rent as of december   at expiration as a general matter based on current market conditions we expect that expiring rents will be at or below the thencurrent market rents acquisitions redevelopment and financing our revenue growth also will depend on our ability to acquire and redevelop and subsequently lease data center space at favorable rates we generally fund the cost of data center acquisition and redevelopment from our net cash provided by operations credit facilities other unsecured and secured table of contents borrowings or the issuance of additional equity we believe that we have sufficient access to capital from our current cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our redevelopment projects operating expenses our operating expenses generally consist of direct personnel costs utilities property and ad valorem taxes insurance and site maintenance costs and rental expenses on our ground and building leases in particular our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations conducted in them although substantially all of our longterm leasesleases with a term greater than three yearscontain reimbursements for certain operating expenses we will not in all instances be reimbursed for all of the property operating expenses we incur we also incur general and administrative expenses including expenses relating to senior management our inhouse sales and marketing organization cloud and managed services support personnel and legal human resources accounting and other expenses related to professional services we also will incur additional expenses arising from being a publicly traded company including employee equitybased compensation increases or decreases in our operating expenses will impact our results of operations and cash flows we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand general leasing activity during the twelve months ended december   we entered into customer leases representing approximately  million of incremental mrr net of downgrades and representing approximately  million of annualized rent at  per square foot in addition  million of leasing commissions was associated with new and renewal leasing activity for the twelve months ended december   during the twelve months ended december   we renewed leases with a total annualized rent of  million at an average rent per square foot of  which was  higher than the annualized rent prior to renewal we define renewals as leases where the customer retains the same amount of space before and after renewal which facilitates rate comparability customers that renew with adjustments to square feet are reflected in the net leasing activity discussed above the rental churn rate for the twelve months ended december   was  during the twelve months ended december   we commenced customer leases representing approximately  million of incremental mrr and representing approximately  million of annualized rent at  per square foot as of december   our bookednotbilled mrr balance which represents customer leases that have been executed but for which lease payments have not commenced as of december   was approximately  million or  million of annualized rent this bookednotbilled balanced is expected to contribute an incremental  million to revenue in  representing  million in annualized revenues an incremental  million in  representing  million in annualized revenues and an incremental  million in annualized revenues thereafter table of contents results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december   changes in revenues and expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year

the increase of  million or  was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in  compared to approximately six and a half months in  which contributed  million to the increase in addition the acquisition of the piscataway facility contributed  million in incremental revenue for the year ended december   the balance aggregating  million related to organic growth in our customer base and placing additional square footage into service in conjunction with the development and expansion of our irving atlantametro richmond and atlantasuwanee data centers the increase of  million or  in combined rental and cloud and managed services revenue was primarily due to the current period including a full year of the leased facilities acquired in  compared to approximately a half year in  which contributed  million to the increase as well as the acquisition of the piscataway facility in  which contributed  million in incremental revenue for the year ended december   additional increases aggregating  million are attributable to newly leased space primarily from ongoing expansions in our atlantametro irving and richmond data centers and increases in rents from previously leased space net of downgrades at renewal and rental churn as of december   our data centers were approximately  occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately  square feet with approximately  square feet occupied and paying rent with an average annualized rent of  per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue or  per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue as of december   the average annualized rent for our c product including managed services for our c product was  per leased raised table

leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue or  per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue the increase in leasable raised floor between  and  is primarily related to the addition of raised floor square footage from our redevelopment activities primarily in the irving atlantametro richmond atlantasuwanee and chicago facilities as well as the acquisition of piscataway the decrease in average annualized rent per leased raised floor square foot both including and excluding cloud and managed services revenue is primarily due to an increase in mix of c customers in our portfolio as of december   a larger portion of our product mix was attributable to c revenue  of mrr compared to december    of mrr due to the fact that c customers reimburse us for utilities and various other operating expenses and that reimbursement is excluded from the calculation of annualized rent per square foot this increase in the portion of customer rent which is related to c customers has contributed to the weighted average per square foot reduction higher recoveries from customers for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   were primarily due to reimbursements associated with the acquisition of the piscataway facility which contributed  million to the increase the remaining increase of  million in recoveries revenue was primarily attributable to the expansion of our irving data center contributing  million to the increase and increased utility costs generally related to an increase in utility usage at our atlantametro data center contributing  million to the increase offset by reduced reimbursements of  million at our princeton facility due to lower operating costs we incurred from efficiencies gained as well as a  million decrease at various other facilities the  million increase in other revenue for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to higher straight line rent property operating costs property operating costs for the year ended december   were  million compared to property operating costs of  million for the year ended

to cover backoffice and servicerelated costs associated with the daytoday operations of these data center facilities with a corresponding offset to general and administrative expenses the remaining

partnership formed on august   and was qts historical predecessor prior to the initial public offering ipo having operated the companys business until the ipo we believe that qts has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit commencing with our taxable year ended december   our qualification as a reit and maintenance of such

approximately  of which is wholly owned by us including approximately  million basisofdesign raised floor square feet which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities this represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full buildout depending on the configuration that we deploy we build out our data center facilities for both general use colocation and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power depending on the needs of each facility at that time as of march   this space included approximately  raised floor operating net rentable square feet or nrsf plus approximately  million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline of which approximately  nrsf is expected to become operational by december   of the total  million nrsf in our development pipeline none was related to customer leases which had been executed but not yet commenced our facilities collectively have access to over  megawatts mw of gross utility power with  mw of available utility power we believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment the following table presents an overview of the portfolio of

item key operating metrics the following sets forth definitions for our key operating metrics these metrics may differ from similar definitions used by other companies monthly recurring revenue mrr we calculate mrr as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date which includes revenue from our c c and c rental and cloud and managed services activities but excludes customer recoveries deferred setup fees variable related revenues noncash revenues and other onetime revenues mrr does not include the impact from bookednotbilled leases as of a particular date unless otherwise specifically noted annualized rent we define annualized rent as mrr multiplied by  rental churn we define rental churn as the mrr lost in the period due to a customer intending to fully exit the qts platform in the near term compared to total mrr at the beginning of the period leasable raised floor we define leasable raised floor as the amount of raised floor square footage that we have leased plus the available capacity of raised floor square footage that is in a leasable format as of a particular date and according to a particular product configuration the amount of our leasable raised floor may change even without completion of new redevelopment projects due to changes in our configuration of c c and c product space percentage  occupied we define percentage occupied as the square footage that is subject to a signed lease for which space is occupied as of a particular date compared to leasable raised floor as of that date expressed as a percentage bookednotbilled we define bookednotbilled as our customer leases that have been signed but for which lease payments have not yet commenced table of contents factors that may influence future results of operations and cash flows revenue our revenue growth will depend on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of leasable raised floor lease currently available space lease new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development and redevelopment activities attract new customers and continue to meet the ongoing technological requirements of our customers as of march   we had in place customer leases generating revenue for approximately  of our leasable raised floor our ability to grow revenue also will be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental cloud and managed services rates at our properties future economic downturns regional downturns or downturns in the technology industry could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers leases on favorable terms or at all and could adversely affect our customers ability to meet their obligations to us negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods which would impact our results of operations and cash flows we also at times may elect to reclaim space from customers in a negotiated transaction where we believe that we can redevelop andor release that space at higher rates which may cause a decrease in revenue until the space is released leasing arrangements as of march    of our mrr came from customers which individually occupied greater than or equal to  square feet of space or approximately  mw of power as of march   approximately  of our mrr was attributable to the metered power model under the metered power model the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount plus reimbursement of certain other operating costs including actual costs of submetered electricity used to power its data center equipment and an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center expressed as a factor of the customers actual electricity usage fluctuations in our customers utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows under the metered power model these leases generally have a minimum term of five years as of march    of our mrr was leased to customers which individually occupied less than  square feet of space as of march   approximately  of our mrr was attributable to the gross lease model under a gross lease the customer pays us a fixed rent on a monthly basis and does not separately reimburse us for operating costs including utilities maintenance repair property taxes and insurance as reimbursement for these costs is factored into mrr however if customers access more utility costs than their leases permit we are able to charge these customers for overages for leases under the gross lease model fluctuations in our customers utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us will impact our results of operations and cash flows our leases on a gross lease basis generally have a term of three years or less scheduled lease expirations our ability to minimize rental churn and customer downgrades at renewal and renew lease and release expiring space will impact our results of operations and cash flows leases which have commenced billing representing approximately  and  of our total leased raised floor are scheduled to expire during the years ending december   including all monthtomonth leases and  respectively these leases also represented approximately  and  respectively of our annualized rent as of march   given that our average rent for larger contracts tend to be at or below market rent at expiration as a general matter based on current market conditions we expect that expiring rents will be at or below the thencurrent market rents acquisitions redevelopment and financing our revenue growth also will depend on our ability to acquire and redevelop and subsequently lease data center space at favorable rates we generally fund the cost of data center acquisition and redevelopment from our net cash provided by operations revolving credit facility other unsecured and secured borrowings or the issuance of additional equity we believe that we have sufficient access to capital from our current cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our credit facility to fund our redevelopment projects operating expenses our operating expenses generally consist of direct personnel costs utilities property and ad valorem taxes insurance and site maintenance costs and rental expenses on our ground and building leases in particular our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations conducted in them although substantially all of our longterm leasesleases with a term greater than three yearscontain reimbursements for certain operating expenses we will not in all instances be reimbursed for all of the property operating expenses we incur we also incur general and administrative expenses including expenses relating to senior management our inhouse sales and marketing organization cloud and managed services support personnel and legal human resources accounting and other expenses related to professional services we also incur additional expenses arising from being a publicly traded table of contents company including employee equitybased compensation increases or decreases in our operating expenses will impact our results of operations and cash flows we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand general leasing activity during the three months ended march   we entered into customer leases representing approximately  million of incremental mrr net of downgrades and representing approximately  million of incremental annualized rent net of downgrades at  per square foot in addition  million of leasing commissions was associated with new and renewal leasing activity for the three months ended march   during the three months ended march   we renewed leases with a total annualized rent of  million at an average rent per square foot of  which was  higher than the annualized rent prior to their respective renewals customers that renew with adjustments to square feet are reflected in the net leasing activity discussed above the rental churn rate for the three months ended march   was  the majority of which was the result of a single customer termination in one of the companys leased facilities in northern virginia which was disclosed in prior quarters excluding this customer termination rental churn for the first quarter of  would be  during the three months ended march   we commenced customer leases representing approximately  million of mrr and representing approximately  million of annualized rent at  per square foot as of march   our bookednotbilled mrr balance which represents customer leases that have been executed but for which lease payments have not commenced as of march   was approximately  million or  million of annualized rent the bookednotbilled balance is expected to contribute an incremental  million to revenue in  representing  million in annualized revenues an incremental  million in  representing  million in annualized revenues and an incremental  million in annualized revenues thereafter we estimate the remaining capital cost to provide the space power connectivity and other services to the customer contracts which had been booked but not billed as of march   to be approximately  million this estimate generally includes c customers with newly contracted space of more than  square feet the space power connectivity and other services provided to customers that contract for smaller amounts of space is generally provided by existing space which was previously developed
