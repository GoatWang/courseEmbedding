reviewsdana greview sourcedana gvalidated reviewverified current userreview sourceauction fundraising made easyupdated on june  validated reviewverified current userwhat do you like bestusing bidpal compared to some other online auction software ive used was like comparing apple to ms dos the user experience was actually enjoyable further bidpals support staff was amazing we had a dyi account and so i called the support line a lot there was always a friendly and knowledgable person who answered my questions lastly bidpal hosts a number of free online webinars open to anyone that i found extremely insightful what do you dislikethe giving center could not be customized in the software version we used nor could some of the receipts hopefully this changes in future iterations the user interface was better than other online auction products ive seen but not as user friendly as sites like shopify with that said i think the version coming out this summer will address some of that recommendations to others considering the producti evaluated a number of different products before deciding on bidpal and the cost is comparable what pushes it over the edge for me is the user friendly interface and backend as well as the quality of the customer support it comes with what business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedfor an organization with limited staff bidpal made the backend really easy for us registration and check out was a breeze and we were able to generate a lot of sales through our online auction before our event even began

who works on our event this is invaluable i like having everything in one place and knowing exactly where we are at in the event planning process the pre and post event reports provide information that helps us improve the event from year to yearwhat do you dislikethere is nothing i dislike about bidpal as a nonprofit i always am watching our budget so i wish we could spend a little less on bidpal at the same time i think the service they provide is worth ever penny we could not do it without themrecommendations to others considering the producti would highly recommend giving bidpal a try for your next eventwhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedwe have a very small development office and a small group of volunteers to run our auction event bidpal is an integral part of our team it make the planning and execution of our event run smoothly year in and year out i love having bidpal on site to help trouble shoot anything that might arise it gives me great peace of mind going into an event knowing i have them to lean on check in and check out the night of our event are a breezy with bidpal what used to take a massive group of
