share this robert c merton  biographical i was born in new york new york on july   the middle child between two sisters stephanie and vanessa i grew up in hastingsonhudson a village of about  outside the city in a house that vanessa and her family live in today my father born in philadelphia the son of immigrant parents was a professor of sociology at columbia university he is now university professor emeritus at columbia having meanwhile been awarded the national medal of science for founding the sociology of science and for his contributions to sociological knowledge such as the selffulfilling prophecy and the focus group my mother from a multigenerational southern new jersey methodistquaker family stayed at home she died in  my mothers mother and many at one time  cats completed the household that shared my childhood hastings was a mixed middleclass and bluecollar town with local employment dominated by a wire and cable company and a chemical plant despite this composition and the towns small size the local public school provided a fine education opportunity in a graduating class of only some  i nevertheless was able to take mathematics through the calculus and five years of science two in physics including a mitdesigned course i was a good student but not at the top of my class i played varsity football and ran track neither with great distinction among my classmates were the sons of the columbia physicists and nobel laureates james rainwater and jack steinberger other longtime hastings residents were the laureate in medicine max theiler and the laureate in economics william vickrey as well as the sculptor jacques lipchitz school work and intellectual interests such as music and the arts were not especially important to me while i was growing up although mathematics my favorite subject was fun baseball was my first passion i played sand lot and little league and rooted for the brooklyn dodgers around age  that passion began to turn toward cars on my bedroom wall i put a large sheet of paper with plus numbers one to be crossed out each day until i would be old enough for my drivers license as i had known all the batting averages and pitching records of big league baseball players so i came to know the horsepower cubic inches of engines size and other detailed specifications of just about every automobile in the postwar era going to auto shows and stock car races and handing tools to older amateur buffs working on their cars were outlets for my passion until at age  i bought and rebuilt my first car after getting my drivers license i built street hot rods which i raced at drag strips in upstate new york and long island i thought that i would become an automobile engineer when i grew up indeed while in college i spent two summers working for ford in its headquarters in dearborn michigan one as an engineer in advanced vehicle design and the other in the lincolnmercury division trying to figure out optimal importing patterns for the english ford other than working in a local cemetery after school and in the summer during high school and a summer spent in information technology at ibm these automotive jobs were the only fulltime nonacademic ones i have had both of my parents played important roles in my early life of learning my father introduced me to baseball poker magic and the stock market only magic didnt take root and books of every kind were everywhere he said nothing directly about expected academic performance there was no need to simply by selfexemplification he set the standards for work effort and for clarity of thought and expression i had the normal fatherson tensions as a teenager but we subsequently became very close for more than  years we have talked to each other at least once nearly every day my mother taught me caring and sensitivity towards the feelings of others animals as well as humans she gave me much good practical advice for getting through life one such counsel in particular i have applied often and in varied arenas first show them that you can do it their way so that you earn the right to do it your way one week before my th birthday i had a blind date with june rose a television actress on network soap operas a model and a regular on the popular dick clarks saturday night american bandstand show from new york we were married five years later one week after my graduation from columbia we devoted much energy to and derived enormous pleasure from raising three wonderful and talented children samantha j robert f and paul j june and i separated in  my arrival at college marked the beginning of serious focus on academic matters just one day after entering columbia college i switched to the engineering school with its small and flexible program and fine faculty it was a great place for an undergraduate to explore mathematics and its uses i took several undergraduate and graduate mathematics courses both applied and pure my tastes were however clear preferring partial differential equations to real analysis and the calculus of variations to functions of a complex variable along with a number of engineering courses including drawing i also took columbias famous contemporary civilization course humanities one introductory course in economics using samuelsons economics a graduate course in mathematical sociology and two general studies night courses in accounting and stock market investments the c or d received in my english literature course in my sophomore year did not help my grade point average the paper ongullivers travels written for that course however became my first published article in the journal of the history of ideas after columbia i went west to pursue a phd in applied mathematics at the california institute of technology my time at cal tech  brief as it was added significantly to my stock of mathematics even more valuable to me was its creed of placing students from the outset in a research framework playing with their subject instead of merely passively learning the material sometime during the year i decided to leave cal tech and mathematics to study economics although he thought it was a bizarre idea gerald whitham the department head provided generous help i applied to half a dozen good departments but only one mit accepted me and it gave me a full fellowship my decision to leave applied mathematics for economics was in part tied to the widelyheld popular belief in the s that macroeconomics had made fundamental inroads into controlling business cycles and stopping dysfunctional unemployment and inflation thus i felt that working in economics could really matter and that potentially one could affect millions of people i also believed that my mathematics and engineering training might give me some advantage in analyzing complex situations most important in my decision was the sense that i had a much better intuition and feel into economic matters than physical ones nowhere was that more apparent to me than in the stock market as early as  or  years of age i developed an interest in money and finance even at play i created fictitious banks such as the rcm savings of dollars and cents company i gladly balanced my mothers check book as already noted my father introduced me to the stock market at  or  i drew up an a list of stocks and bought my first one general motors in college i spent time doing some trading learning tape watching and hearing the lore of the market from retail traders in brokerage houses in late  i had my first experience in what is now known as risk arbitrage the trade surrounding the merger of friden company and singer company involved buying friden shares and shorting singer shares in a ratio of to the current difference in value between the two would become a surething profit provided the merger went through fortunately for me it did at cal tech many mornings i would get to a local brokerage house at  am  am in new york for the opening of the stock market spend a couple of hours watching the tape and trading and then go to my classes in addition to stocks i traded warrants convertible bonds and overthecounter options although i did apply mathematical skills my valuation approaches were essentially ad hoc nevertheless i learned much from those varied transactional experiences about markets and institutions which proved useful in my later research for instance in discovering specialized banks that would legally finance my convertible bond positions at  percent of their value leveraging terms considerably superior to the  percent financing offered by standard margin accounts i learned early on that the institutional rigidities often postulated as inviolate in academic financialmarket modeling can be more flexible and permeable in their realworld counterparts when i arrived at mit in the fall of  i discovered why they had admitted me when no other institution had harold freeman statistician and member of the economics department from presamuelson days harold had recognized some of the mathematicians who had written my letters of recommendation and convinced the department to take a flyer now in the role of firstyear advisor he saw my proposed traditional course plan and told me you follow that and youll leave here by the end of the term out of boredom  go take paul samuelsons mathematical economics course i did not only did i get to interact with paul samuelson but i met the then secondyear students stanley fischer and michael rothschild i learned economics from pauls foundations and wrote a term paper on an optimal growth model with endogenous population changes which was later published in  as a result of our meeting in his course paul hired me as his research assistant that spring quite a yield from a single course in the course of my work for paul we discovered shared interests and some common knowledge about the stock market warrants and convertible securities i found out that my afterbeforehours interest in such things could also be a legitimate part of my dayhours devoted to research in the summer of  we began a joint effort to advance pauls  theory of warrant pricing which was subsequently published in  later in october i would have my first experience presenting in a formal seminar my coauthor decided that i the secondyear grad student and not he the institute professor would give our paper at the inaugural session of the mitharvard mathematical economics seminar with a full audience of harvard economics faculty including kenneth arrow wassily leontief and hendrik houthakker it was surely a memorable baptism the research with paul on warrant pricing introduced me to the expected utility maxim and its application to optimal portfolio selection in a static framework as a consequence of that effort i began to think about combining the static theory of portfolio selection with the intertemporal optimization of lifetime consumption under certainty found in the growthmodel literature ignorant of the important work underway by nils hakansson and hayne leland then graduate students elsewhere i attacked the problem of dynamic portfolio theory in a continuoustime framework without having the benefit of their discretetime formulations despite all the mathematics courses that i had taken l had seen neither stochastic dynamic programming nor the ito calculus both of which turned out to be key mathematical tools needed for this research instead driven by need i found them and learned them on my own presented first at a harvardmit graduate student seminar in november  my paper on lifetime consumption and portfolio selection under uncertainty was published the following august as a companion paper to one by paul investigating the effect of age on portfolio risk tolerance despite having paul samuelson franco modigliani robert solow frank fisher robert bishop evsey domar peter diamond peter temin and ed kuh as teachers i must confess that my focus was more on research than classes from the beginning and my course grades reflected that however no one could have had a better introduction to economics than i did with these great teachers and the opportunity to live in paul samuelsons office as his assistant for two and a half years three of the five chapters of my thesis were published before the thesis was submitted a fourth optimum consumption and portfolio rules in a continuoustime model was presented at the second world congress of the econometric society in august  and was published in  during those most productive days of graduate study i also developed much of my  working paper on equilibrium asset pricing and the pricing of the capital structure of the firm which formed the core of my later papers on the intertemporal capital asset pricing model the rational theory of option pricing and the pricing of corporate debt paul nominated me to be a junior fellow at harvard after being rejected however i had no choice but to get a job i spent the fall and winter of  interviewing only with departments of economics but i ended up taking an appointment to teach finance at mits sloan school of management it was franco modigliani with a foot in both the department and sloan who made the invitation and who convinced me that i could teach there even though i had no formal training in finance i had been a student of francos and my research on optimal lifetime consumption and portfolio selection supported his lifecycle hypothesis our relationship however became even stronger in the years after i joined sloan i was especially honored and greatly touched when he invited me to be the speaker at the traditional american economics association luncheon honoring him for receiving the  nobel prize that occasion the remarks later published in economic perspectives provided the opportunity to express albeit inadequately the deep respect and affection i hold for franco some years later he made a physically very demanding trip to rome specifically to be the speaker at the national academy of lincei on the occasion celebrating my receiving the international inaaccademia nazionale dei lincei prize it was in the process of interviewing for the job at sloan that i met myron scholes a recent arrival to the faculty from the university of chicago as i note in the accompanying lecture the story of my meeting myron scholes and fischer black and our subsequent interactions and collaborations are well described in myrons nobel lecture in our joint tribute in memory of fischer black in fischers own writings and in the book by peter bernstein thus even with its obvious central importance to my professional life both its academic and practitioner parts there is no need to repeat it here when i joined the finance group at mit the faculty consisted of assistant professors myron scholes stewart myers and gerry pogue and senior professors daniel holland and franco modigliani dan specialized in tax matters and franco was involved in many things everywhere as a consequence de facto the junior faculty ran everything in the group with respect to both teaching and research it was a wonderful environment of benign neglect in which all of us could grow i enjoyed teaching from the start my first experience was in  as one of four graduate students karen johnson david scheffman and jeremy siegel were the others who teamtaught the second monetary course usually taught by paul samuelson i began however fulltime teaching at sloan in the fall of  with two regular courses in the masters degree program in management general finance and advanced capital markets in the basic course involving both capital markets and corporate finance i taught markowitztobin portfolio theory the sharpelintnermossin capital asset pricing model and the modiglianimiller theorems learning much of the material barely before i presented it to the students for my own sense of security and to provide some evidence of preparation to the students i gave them detailed handwritten teaching notes for each class lecturing from them saved me from having to write everything down on the blackboard and saved the students from having to copy what i would have otherwise written this in turn left more time for inclass discussion these notes became so popular that i prepared similar ones for every course i taught at sloan long after i had learned the subject matter in the capital markets course that first year i introduced intertemporal portfolio selection blackscholes type option pricing and hedging and its application to the pricing of corporate liabilities i did so not as an outlet for presenting my research interests but because i thought that the training would be quite useful in practice i believed that teaching this material even before it was published was more important for the ms students than for the phd students since nonacademic jobs were not likely to provide the same opportunity as academics to keep up with the research literature after graduation at sloan in those days ms and phd students in finance took the same courses and so both groups were exposed to this research long before its publication throughout the  years i spent at the sloan school it was a stimulating and happy place to do research i shall always owe a great debt to my brilliant colleagues there myron scholes and fischer black franco modigliani stewart myers john cox chifu huang terry marsh richard ruback douglas breeden unfortunately only as a visitor and from the economics department stanley fischer and paul samuelson the tenure and the tenor of the finance area varied considerably and it was small rarely having more than a half dozen members at a time but the quality of mind diversity of thought devotion to the subject of finance and genuine affection for one another were reliable constants throughout those years i see my research interests as fitting into three regimes of roughly equal lengths across time  to   to  and  to the present with a reflective year  the first period was my most productive one for basic research in terms of both the number of papers produced and the originality and significance of contribution the central modeling theme was continuoustime stochastic processes with continuousdecisionmaking by agents locating this modeling approach within mathematical economics i see my models falling in the middle range between simple models eg one or twoperiods with a representative agent designed to give insights associated by some with the mit school and full general equilibrium models on a grand scale involving an arbitrary number of agents with general preferences and production technologies often associated with the berkeley school compared with discretetime dynamic formulations the continuoustime models are mathematically more complex but by explicitly setting the trading interval and modeling the evolution of the system as diffusion processes the derived results of the continuoustime models were often more precise and easier to interpret than their discretetime counterparts as a consequence these theoretical models combined enough richness and tractability to be applied normatively for decisions in practice and positively in empirical tests of course all models involve abstractions from complex reality i see the relative importance of my contribution to be more in selecting good abstractions than in introducing and applying mathematical power my first decades research focus on developing dynamic models of optimal lifetime consumption and portfolio selection equilibrium asset pricing and contingentclaim pricing shifted in the  period to applications of those models a series of papers examined the various riskbearing roles of payasyougo and funded social security and definedbenefit definedcontribution and integrated privatesector pension plans i also applied optionpricing theory to the valuation of deposit insurance markettiming information corporate investment decisions and implicit labor contracts i worked on models for estimating expected returns on the market portfolio for fitting dividend and earnings behavior and for testing of investor markettiming skills a number of papers including my presidential address to the american finance association examined the rationality of capitalmarket prices and the effects of market imperfections on equilibrium asset prices with stanley fischer i also wrote on issues common to macroeconomics and finance others whom i was fortunate to publish with during this period were zvi bodie mathew gladstein roy henriksson alan marcus terry marsh scott mason and for the first time myron scholes in contrast during the prior decade i had had only two coauthors three papers with paul samuelson and one with marti subrahmanyam in  i took my firstever sabbatical year to write a book based on my work in continuoustime finance peter dougherty then an editor at basil blackwell had suggested a book nearly a year before that would use my previously published papers as the core as it happened i had been thinking about putting my ideas on the subject together and peters expressed interest served as a catalyst mit graciously provided my full salary for the year and the harvard business school kindly offered an office in which to work it was a most enjoyable and productive time with no other commitments i wrote nearly every day with no limit on length and no set deadline for either any piece or the whole earlier writings were corrected and in some cases significantly expanded five new chapters were created incorporating my cumulative thoughts in the fields of optimal portfolio selection option pricing financial intermediation and general equilibrium theory i even took pleasure in developing my own extensive index and bibliography this reflective year was a watershed both for my research and for where it would take place in effect continuoustime finance was the crowning synthesis of my earlier work its chapter  on intermediation and institutions however represented a bridge to a new direction of my research from that time until the present i have focused on understanding the financial system with special emphasis on the dynamics of institutional change in particular i am studying the role of financial technology and innovation in driving changes in financial institution and market design the management of financialservice firms and the regulatory and the accounting systems there is however continuity of this line of inquiry with the past fischers myrons and my derivativesecurity research provided much of the foundation for the contracting and securitydesign technology that is central to the extraordinary wave of realworld financial innovation of the past two decades my decision to move from mit to the harvard business school in  was significantly influenced by this turn in my research interests although it was a difficult decision to make i have never since doubted that it was the right one both the institution and my colleagues have treated me in extraordinary fashion a prime exemplifying case shortly after my joining the hbs faculty thendean john mcarthur resigned from the george fisher baker professorship in order to give it to me giving the name chair of the foundingsponsor of the schoolknown as the deans chair since the beginningto a newly arrived professor of mathematical finance who had not yet taught a single hbs student was a towering symbol and statement of confidence and support that recognition meant all the more to me because it was given after i had happily accepted the schools offer and this timing made it altogether clear that it was not part of any negotiation now a decade later i am especially pleased to become the first john and natty mcarthur university professor and to have the baker chair become once again the deans chair for nearly a decade i have enjoyed developing the new work on the financial system to begin with on my own but then quite soon after in a delightful productive and multifaceted collaboration with zvi bodie professor of finance at boston university whom i have known since the early s when he was a student in the mit department of economics together we have developed the idea of using a functional perspective to analyze and to predict financial institutional change over time and to provide a better understanding of contemporaneous institutional differences across geopolitical borders zvi and i have refined and applied this idea in a series of working papers published articles and book chapters in  zvi and my hbs colleague and my former mit student carliss baldwin led the way to the creation of the global financial system project at the harvard business school the project which involves several of my finance colleagues and zvi working together with senior management from  major global financialservice firms has considerably expanded the research effort devoted to applying the functional approach to the financial system and to the management of financial institutions whether published as jointly or singly authored my work with zvi in this area has always been collaborative conceived at the outset as a parallel development to our research but completed only now is our textbook on basic finance that applies this perspective and presents the subject as a set of principles much like firstcourses in economics and the physical sciences throughout the last  years of academic research i have been involved in finance practice the vast bulk of my research has been in mathematical finance theory but i believe that my involvement in practice has shaped that research and in turn has been shaped by it this interplay to the benefit of both a targeted instance can be found in the section of my  rational option pricing paper on pricing and hedging the risk of the downandout call option i became aware of such instruments in the early s only as a consequence of a consulting assignment from a firm that was issuing them in asia in the decades since the downandout option has become the prototype example of the exotic option which is now a large mainstream class of financialproduct offerings my first consulting experience was in  for a southern california bank on the pricing of warrants ironically had the equalyieldforequal sigmarisk model i developed ad hoc for them been taken to its continuoustrading limit it would have led to the blackscholes pricing formula but of course without any of the rigorous foundation underlying that formula which includes the key hedging insight of black and scholes myron scholes and i began working together on consulting projects shortly after i joined the sloan faculty in  we were engaged by mathew gladstein of the options department of donaldson lufkin  jenrette to develop option pricing and hedging models for the overthecounter market and later for the new chicago board options exchange in  leo pomerance head of the dlj options department became the first chairman of the cboe myron and i learned much from our dlj experience and indeed our first publications together in  and  evolved directly from a mutualfund project which dlj helped us to underwrite as a consequence of the extraordinary decline in the stock market in  myron and i had an idea for a mutualfund product that would provide significant downside protection to the investor while at the same time affording significant exposure to upside movements in the stock market the strategy designed to do this was to purchase a diversified portfolio of call options with  percent of the assets and to invest the balance of the assets in shortterm moneymarket instruments with those proportions rebalanced every  months since the strategy involved option buying instead of option writing many cautioned us that the sec might see it as too speculative for the first optionbased mutual fund in the united states and thus would create serious roadblocks they were wrong the staff of the sec apparently understood the funds relatively conservative design and approved it with essentially no delays the strategy was thus implemented with the creation of money marketoptions investment inc an openended mutual fund which went effective in february  the portfolios subsequent performance fit the simulations projected for it nevertheless and despite being a direct predecessor to the portfolioinsurance products of the s and the various successful floor products offered around the globe in the s mmoi was not a commercial success still it was for us a broadening experience about the multidimensional aspects of setting up a new financial entity as myron is fond of observing sometimes the early bird gets the worm  and sometimes it gets frozen for the rest of the s and much of s i kept my hand in practice serving on a few mutual fund boards and being elected a trustee of college retirement equities fund during the early s several of my former students from mit most of them phds were attracted to salomon brothers the global investment bank by john meriwether and under his leadership they helped build an enormously successful proprietary trading group focused on arbitrage in the fixedincome markets the core financial technology used in the group was based on the blackscholesmerton derivativesecurity models but it was highly refined to take account of much greater empirical detail and practical market experience in  one of those former students eric rosenfeld and thomas strauss then president of salomon came to see me about becoming a special consultant to the office of the chairman they made me an offer i couldnt refuse unlike the simple modelbuildingproductdesign role of my past consultancies this one also called for a role as trusted advisor with technical skills to the ceo on business matters of the firm and on the direction of institutional change in the global financial system one could hardly imagine a better fit to inform and to be informed by my thennew direction of research on the functional perspective over the next four years i learned much about the operations and management of a global intermediary and trust that i contributed something as well i definitely strengthened old friendships with former students and developed new friendships with their colleagues and myron and i got back together in practice when he joined salomon from stanford in early  john meriwether who had left salomon in  eric rosenfeld who had recently left and james mcentee former chairman and cofounder of carrollmcentee the primary governmentbond dealer and johns longtime friend had the idea of building a new firm to undertake fixedincome arbitrage on a global basis the thought of working with john and eric once again and having a hand in building a largescale financial firm from scratch was exciting and i immediately volunteered to help out over the ensuing months one at a time senior members of johns old group left salomon and showed up ready to get involved in what became longterm capital management ltcm victor haghani arrived in the spring gregory hawkins and myron scholes bringing us back together in practice once again in the summer william krasker in the fall and richard leahy and larry hilibrand at year end the last of the founders david mullins who joined ltcm in late winter never worked at salomon with a phd from mit and  years on the finance faculty at harvard business school before going into government service he exemplifies the strong mit and hbs connections among the founders of ltcm seven of the eleven founders and nine of the current sixteen principals of the firm were either graduates or on their faculties or both this small group of founding principals together with a few key early employees put together and tested the financial telecommunication and computer technologies hired the strategists and operations people to run them designed the organizational structure of the business executed the complex contractual agreements with investors and counterparties found and outfitted physical quarters in both the united states and london and helped to raise over  billion from investors the design and development efforts along each of these dimensions attempted to marry the best of finance theory with the best of finance practice it all came together in february  when the firm began active business today ltcm has  employees a third office in tokyo and its capital has grown considerably it was deliciously intense and exciting to have been a part of creating ltcm for making it possible i will never be able to adequately express my indebtedness to my extraordinarily talented ltcm colleagues the distinctive ltcm experience from the beginning to the present characterizes the theme of the productive interaction of finance theory and finance practice indeed in a twist on the more familiar version of that theme the major investment magazine institutional investor characterized the remarkable collection of people at ltcm as the best finance faculty in the world  in long retrospect unexpected roads happily traveled   personal born july   new york new york address harvard business

mit professor and nobel laureate thinks retirement will change by garrett brennan  updated march    robert c merton a nobel laureate in economics who helped change the financial industry with his work on the “black scholes formula” has now suggested a solution for how the world is going to address retirement  through a product called a reverse mortgage in his speech to a crowded room of financial experts merton stated “this is the greatest thing since sliced bread for retirees yet no one is doing it” dr merton is clearly excited about this financial instrument but why is this mit professor exaggerating the benefits of a reverse mortgage if he is actually right why aren’t more people taking advantage of them why does merton have faith in reverse mortgages his argument starts with a simple truth – people are living longer for simplicity let’s imagine that fifty years ago the average american used to work for  years and then retire for  years fast forward to today what happens if the average retirement lasts for  years instead scenario   of the years go towards saving while  go towards spending scenario   of the years go towards saving while  go towards spending while that can seem frightening dr merton is quick to remind us that longevity is a blessing if planned for appropriately “all of this is basically good it’s just a challenge” essentially it is a balance between consumption standard of living years worked and financial creativity the question becomes what are americans doing to address that last point how do we get more out of the assets we have if you are like most americans your house is the most valuable asset you own a reverse mortgage allows you to tap into the equity already invested in your home here’s how it works a lender will offer you a loan in the form of a lump sum monthly payment line of credit or any combination thereof this money is taxfree and can be used to make home improvements pay medical bills enjoy a vacation or whatever else so long as you pay your usual homerelated expenses and do not allow the home to significantly deteriorate in exchange the loan accrues interest which only becomes payable once you pass away move or sell the home it is important to note that even if the loan grows to become larger than the value of the house you will not be required to repay any additional loan balance in excess of the value of the home here is the best part when the loan comes due the bank’s only form of recourse is through the house that means your debt can’t be extended to your heirs your income or anything other than the home itself here are the most common scenarios what if the house is worth more than the outstanding loan amount great you can sell the house pay off the loan and keep the difference what if the house is worth less than the outstanding loan amount you can allow the bank to take ownership of the house and walk away with the money you’ve borrowed what if i pass away will the debt be transferred onto my kids no your heirs will walk through the decision to either pay back the loan or sell the house depending on their preference if they want they can let the bank take the house guaranteeing they won’t have to pay anything out of pocket what should i know before taking the next step if you need extra cash through retirement and want to stay in your home a reverse mortgage can be a brilliant option before applying you will be required to go through an independent consultation to confirm that a reverse mortgage is suitable for your financial situation here are some basic facts to keep in mind when considering a reverse mortgage reverse mortgages are fhainsured loans you or your coborrower typically a spouse needs to be age  or above you are borrowing against your home equity you do
