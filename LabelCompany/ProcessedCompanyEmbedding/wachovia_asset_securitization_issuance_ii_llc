certain legal aspects of the mortgage loans  enforceability of certain provisions herein the rate of prepayments on fixedrate mortgage loans such as the mortgage loans is sensitive to prevailing interest rates generally if prevailing interest rates fall significantly below the interest rates on the mortgage loans the mortgage loans are likely to be subject to higher prepayment rates than if prevailing rates remain at or above the interest rates on the mortgage loans conversely if prevailing interest rates rise significantly above the interest rates on the mortgage loans the rate of prepayments is likely to decrease the average life of the offered certificates and if purchased at other than par the yields realized by holders of the offered certificates will be sensitive to levels of payment including prepayments relating to the mortgage loans the prepayments on the mortgage loans in general the yield on an offered certificate that is purchased at a premium from the outstanding principal amount thereof will be adversely affected by a higher than anticipated level of prepayments of the mortgage loans and enhanced by a lower than anticipated level conversely the yield on an offered certificate that is purchased at a discount from the outstanding principal amount thereof will be enhanced by a higher than anticipated level of prepayments and adversely affected by a lower than anticipated level the yield to maturity on the class sa and class sax certificates will be extremely sensitive to the level of prepayments of the group sa mortgage loans therefore the yield to maturity on the class sa and class sax certificates will decrease as a result of faster than expected prepayments on the group sa mortgage loans prospective investors should fully consider the risks associated with an investment in the class sa and class sax certificates including the possibility that if the rate of prepayments on the group sa mortgage loans is rapid such investors may not fully recoup their initial investments the yield to maturity on the class a and class ax certificates will be extremely sensitive to the level of prepayments of the group a mortgage loans therefore the

fully recoup their initial investments the yield to maturity on each class of senior subordinate certificates will be extremely sensitive to realized losses on the mortgage loans other than special hazard losses fraud losses and bankruptcy losses in excess of the applicable coverage therefor provided by the subordinate certificates because a disproportionately large amount of such losses rather

balances of all classes of certificates exceeds the aggregate loan balance the class of subordinate certificates then outstanding with the highest class designation will be reduced by the amount of such excess the weighted average life of and the yield to maturity on the subordinate certificates in decreasing order of their priority of distributions will be progressively more sensitive to the rate and timing of mortgagor defaults and the severity of ensuing losses on the mortgage loans if the actual rate and severity of losses on the mortgage loans is higher than those assumed by a holder of a subordinate certificate the actual yield to maturity of such certificate may be lower than the yield expected by such holder based on such assumption the timing of losses on the mortgage loans will also affect an investors actual yield to maturity even if the rate of defaults and severity of losses over the life of the mortgage loans are consistent with such investors expectations in general the earlier a loss occurs the greater the effect on an investors yield to maturity losses on the mortgage loans will reduce the class principal balance of the subordinate certificates to the extent of any losses allocated thereto without the receipt of cash attributable to such reduction see description of the certificates  subordination and allocation of losses herein as a result of such

foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust security deed or mortgage a deficiency judgment would be a personal judgment against the former borrower equal in most cases to the difference between the net amount received upon the public sale of the real property and the amount due to the lender other statutes require the beneficiary or mortgagee to exhaust the security afforded under a deed of trust security deed or mortgage by foreclosure in an attempt to satisfy the full debt before bringing a personal action against the borrower finally other statutory provisions limit any deficiency judgment against the former borrower following a judicial sale to the excess of the outstanding debt over the fair market value of the property at the time of the public sale the purpose of these statutes is generally to prevent a beneficiary or a mortgagee from obtaining a large deficiency judgment against the former borrower as a result of low or no bids at the judicial sale applicable state laws

respect to mortgage loans which it purchases including by acquisitions or mergers or originates the seller believes that many of the mortgage loans were underwritten with exceptions to these guidelines those that were made with exceptions to these underwriting guidelines were approved when other compensating factors existed the seller believes its standards are consistent with those utilized by mortgage lenders generally the underwriting process is intended to assess both the prospective borrowers ability to repay and the adequacy of the real property security as collateral for the loan granted loans may be made outside of those guidelines with the prior approval of a senior official of the seller the seller generally originates or purchases fixed rate loans which fully amortize over a period not to exceed  months the original loan amounts generally range from a minimum of  to a maximum of  the homes used for collateral to secure the loans may be either primary residential which includes second and vacation homes or investor owned one to fourfamily homes condominiums planned unit developments or modular homes or townhouses the loantovalue ratio generally may not exceed  for a primary residence and  for a second home each property proposed as security for a loan must be appraised each mortgage applicant generally provides and the seller generally verifies personal financial information the applicants total monthly obligations which includes principal and interest on each mortgage tax assessments other loans charge accounts and all other scheduled indebtedness generally cannot exceed  of the applicants gross monthly income applicants who are salaried employees must provide current employment information in addition to two recent years of employment history and the seller verifies this information verifications are based on written confirmation from employers or a combination of a recent pay stub the most recent w tax form and telephone confirmation from the employer selfemployed applicants must be selfemployed in the same field for a minimum of two years the selfemployed applicant must provide signed copies of complete federal income tax returns including schedules filed for the most recent two years a credit report by an independent credit reporting agency is generally required reflecting the applicants complete credit history the credit report should reflect all delinquencies of  days or more repossessions judgments foreclosures garnishments bankruptcies divorce actions and similar adverse credit practices that can be discovered by a search of public records if the report is obtained more than  or  days depending on type of property prior to the loan closing the lender must determine that the reported information has not changed all taxes and assessments not included in the payment must be verified as current the seller is responsible for using sound judgment in underwriting the loans consistent with prudent industry practices generally the applicant should have an acceptable credit history given the amount of equity available the strength of the applicants employment history and the level of the applicants income to debt obligations the rescission period must have expired prior to funding a loan the rescission period may not be waived by the applicant except as permitted by law an attorneys title opinion or an alta title insurance policy is required for all loans the applicant is required to secure property insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the new loan the seller must

interest when a mortgagor prepays a mortgage loan in full between due dates for such mortgage loan the mortgagor pays interest on the amount prepaid only to the date of prepayment instead of for the entire month also when a curtailment is made on a mortgage loan together with the scheduled monthly payment for a month on or after the related due date the principal balance of the mortgage loan is reduced by the amount of the curtailment as of such due date but such principal is not distributed to related certificateholders until the distribution date in the next month therefore one month of interest shortfall accrues on the amount of such curtailment in order to reduce the adverse effect on certificateholders from the deficiency in interest payable as a result of a payoff or curtailment on a mortgage loan between its due dates the servicer will pass through compensating interest to the related certificateholders to the limited extent and in the manner set forth below the servicer is obligated to remit to the distribution account on the day prior to each distribution date with respect to the mortgage loans in each loan group an amount equal to the lesser of a any shortfall for the related month in interest collections resulting from the timing of payoffs made other than on the first day of the month or curtailments and b the monthly servicing fee payable to the servicer to the extent that the amount allocated to a loan group to pay compensating interest is insufficient to cover the deficiency in interest payable as a result of a payoff and any deficiency as a result of a curtailment on a mortgage loan such deficiency will be allocated to the certificates of the related certificate group pro rata according to the amount of interest to which each related class of

certificates then entitled to receive payments of principal will receive a partial prepayment on the july  distribution date in an aggregate amount equal to the remainder of the prefunded amount although no assurances can be given the seller intends that the principal amount of subsequent mortgage loans sold to the trust fund will require the application of substantially all of the prefunded amount and that there should be no material amount of principal prepaid from the prefunded amount to the holders of any of the certificates the subordinate certificates the weighted average life of and the yield to maturity on the subordinate certificates in decreasing order of their priority of distributions will be progressively more sensitive to the rate and timing of mortgagor defaults and the severity of ensuing losses on the mortgage loans if the actual rate and severity of losses on the mortgage loans is higher than those assumed by a holder of a subordinate certificate the actual yield to maturity of such certificate may be lower than the yield expected by such holder based on such assumption the timing of losses on the mortgage loans will also affect an investors actual yield to maturity even if the rate of defaults and severity of losses over the life of the mortgage loans are consistent with such investors expectations in general the earlier a loss occurs the greater the

payments on the mortgage loans in the related loan group which may be in the form of scheduled payments or prepayments see risk factors herein and yield and prepayment considerations in the prospectus mortgagors may prepay the mortgage loans at any time without penalty a higher than anticipated rate of prepayments would reduce the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans more quickly than expected as a consequence aggregate interest payments with respect to the mortgage loans would be substantially less than expected therefore a higher rate of prepayments in a loan group could result in a lower than expected yield to maturity on each related class of certificates purchased at a premium and in certain circumstances such investors may not fully recoup their initial investments conversely a lower than anticipated rate of prepayments in a loan group would reduce the return to investors on any related classes of certificates purchased at a discount in that principal payments with respect to the mortgage loans would occur later than anticipated there can be no assurance that certificateholders will be able to reinvest amounts received with respect to the certificates at a

on mortgage loans are commonly measured relative to a prepayment standard or model the prepayment model used in this prospectus supplement the basic prepayment assumption or bpa represents an assumed rate of prepayment each month relative to the then outstanding principal balance of a pool of mortgage loans for all mortgage loans a  basic prepayment assumption assumes a per annum rate of prepayment of  of the then outstanding principal balance of a pool of mortgage loans in the first month of the life of such mortgage loan following which such annual prepayment rate increases by  each month until the th month after origination of such mortgage loans and remains constant at  per annum in the th month after origination of such mortgage loans and in each month thereafter as used in the tables below a  bpa assumes current rates equal to  of the bpa correspondingly a  bpa assumes prepayment rates equal to  of the bpa and so forth bpa does not purport to be either an historical description of the prepayment experience of any pool of mortgage loans or a prediction of the anticipated rate of prepayment of any pool of mortgage loans including the mortgage loans and there is no assurance that the mortgage loans in any loan group will prepay at any given percentage of the bpa the actual rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans may be influenced by a variety of economic geographic social and other factors in general if prevailing interest rates fall significantly below the interest rates on the mortgage loans the mortgage loans are likely to be subject to higher

mortgage loans will be secured by either deeds of trust deeds to secure debt or mortgages each a security instrument depending upon the prevailing practice in the state in which the mortgaged property is located a mortgage creates a lien upon the real property described in the mortgage it is not prior to the lien for real estate taxes and assessments priority between mortgages depends on their terms and generally on the order of recording with a state or county office there are two parties to a mortgage the mortgagor who is the homeowner and the mortgagee who is the lender under the mortgage instrument the mortgagor delivers to the mortgagee a note or bond and the mortgage a deed of trust formally has three parties the homeowner called the grantor similar to a mortgagor a lender similar to the mortgagee called the beneficiary and a thirdparty grantee called the trustee under a deed of trust the grantor grants the property irrevocably until the debt is paid in trust with the power of sale to the trustee to secure payment of the obligation the trustees authority under a deed of trust and the mortgagees authority under a mortgage are governed by law s pbst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st the express provisions of the deed of trust or the mortgage and in some cases under a deed of trust the direction of the beneficiary priority between security instruments of record generally depends in the first instance on the order of filing with the appropriate government records office priority also may be affected by the express terms of the security instrument or other documents such as subordination agreements therefore since a title report or title policy only is accurate as of the date it is issued it provides no assurance that a security instrument will retain perpetually the lien priority it had when it was filed the security instruments securing the mortgage loans include a requirement that each borrower maintain the lien priority of each security instrument foreclosure if a borrower defaults under a loan secured by a security instrument the lender generally may bring suit against the borrower the lender generally also may attempt to collect the loan by causing the security instrument to be enforced against the property it encumbers foreclosure of a deed of trust or a deed to secure debt is generally accomplished by a nonjudicial trustees sale under a specific provision in the deed of trust or security deed which authorizes the sale of the property to a third party upon any default by the borrower under the terms of the note deed of trust or security deed in some states the trustee must record a notice of default and send a copy to the borrowergrantor and to any person who has recorded a request for a copy of a notice of default and notice of sale in addition the trustee must provide notice in some states to any other individual having an interest in the real property including any junior lien holders the borrower or any other person having a junior encumbrance on the real estate may during a reinstatement period cure the default by paying the entire amount in arrears plus the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the obligations generally state laws require that a through advertisements and other means notice of the sale be given to all parties having an interest in the real property in certain states such notice may include posting a copy of the notice on the property foreclosure of a mortgage is generally accomplished by judicial action the action is initiated by the service of legal pleadings upon all parties having an interest in the real property delays in completion of the foreclosure may occasionally result from difficulties in locating necessary parties defendant judicial foreclosure proceedings are sometimes not contested by any of the parties defendant in the case of foreclosure under a security instrument the sale by the referee or other designated officer or by the trustee as applicable is a public sale it is not uncommon for the lender to purchase the property at foreclosure in many cases where the lender purchases at foreclosure it usually purchases the property for an amount equal to the principal amount of the security instrument accrued and unpaid interest and the expense of foreclosure because i there may be no equity in the security property ii there is a requirement that the purchaser pay to bid for the property in cash or by cashiers check iii a potential buyer at the sale may find it difficult to determine the exact status of title and other facts about the security property and iv the physical condition of the security property may have deteriorated it generally is more common for the lender rather than an unrelated third party to purchase the security property at foreclosure the lender or other purchaser at the trustees sale will be subject to the burdens of ownership including the obligations to obtain hazard insurance and to make such repairs at its own expense as are necessary to render the security property suitable for resale the lender commonly will attempt to resell the security property and obtain the services of a real estate broker and agree to pay the broker a commission in connection with the resale depending upon market conditions the ultimate proceeds of the resale of the security property may not be high enough to equal the lenders investment property securing a mortgage loan that is acquired through a trustees sale or judicial foreclosure must be sold by the trustee within three years after the date on which it is acquired in order to satisfy certain federal income tax requirements the proceeds received from the sale generally are applied first to the costs fees and expenses of sale and then in

the holders of junior security instruments and other liens and claims in order of their priority any balance remaining generally is payable to the grantor or mortgagor following the sale if there are insufficient proceeds to repay the secured debt the beneficiary under the foreclosed lien generally may obtain a deficiency judgment against the grantor or mortgagor see   antideficiency legislation bankruptcy and consumer protection legislation below some courts have been faced with the issue of whether federal or state constitutional due process requires that borrowers under deeds of trust receive notices in addition to the statutorily prescribed minimum for the most part the courts in these cases have upheld the notice provisions and procedures described above rights of redemption in some states after sale pursuant to a deed of trust or foreclosure of a mortgage the borrower and foreclosed junior lienors are given a statutory period in which to redeem the property from the foreclosure sale in some states redemption may occur only upon payment of the entire principal balance of the loan accrued interest and expenses of foreclosure in other states redemption may be authorized if the former borrower pays only a portion of the sums due the effect of a statutory right of redemption is to diminish the ability of the lender to sell the foreclosed property the rights of redemption would defeat the title of any purchaser from the lender subsequent to foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust consequently the practical effect of the redemption right is to force the lender to retain the property and pay the expenses of ownership until the redemption period has run antideficiency legislation bankruptcy and consumer protection legislation certain states have imposed statutory prohibitions which limit the remedies of a beneficiary under a deed of trust or security deed or a mortgagee under a mortgage in some states statutes limit the right of the beneficiary or mortgagee to obtain or prohibit the beneficiary or mortgagee from obtaining a deficiency judgment against the borrower following foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust a deficiency judgment would be a personal judgment against the former borrower equal in most cases to the difference between the net amount received upon the public sale of the real property and the amount due to the lender other statutes require the beneficiary or mortgagee to exhaust the security afforded under a security instrument by foreclosure in an attempt to satisfy the full debt before bringing a personal action against the borrower finally other statutory provisions limit any deficiency judgment against the former borrower following a judicial sale to the excess of the outstanding debt over the fair market value of the property at the time of the public sale the purpose of these statutes is generally to prevent a beneficiary or a mortgagee from obtaining a large deficiency judgment against the former borrower as a result of low or no bids at the judicial sale in addition to laws limiting or prohibiting deficiency judgments numerous other statutory provisions including the federal bankruptcy laws and state laws affording relief to debtors may interfere with or affect the ability of the secured mortgage lender to realize upon the sale of the collateral andor enforce a deficiency judgment for example with respect to federal bankruptcy law a court with federal bankruptcy jurisdiction may permit a debtor through his or her chapter  or chapter  rehabilitative plan to cure a monetary default in respect of a mortgage loan on such debtors residence by paying arrearages within a reasonable time period and reinstating the original mortgage loan payment schedule even though the lender accelerated the mortgage loan and final judgment of foreclosure had been entered in state court provided no sale of the residence had yet occurred prior to the filing of the debtors petition some courts with federal bankruptcy jurisdiction have approved plans based on the particular facts of the reorganization case that effected the curing of a mortgage loan default by paying arrearages over a number of years courts with federal bankruptcy jurisdiction have also indicated that the terms of a mortgage loan secured by property of the debtor may be modified these courts have suggested that such modifications may include reducing the amount of each monthly payment changing the rate of interest altering the repayment schedule and reducing the lenders security interest to the value of the residence thus leaving the lender as a general unsecured creditor for the difference between the value of the residence and the outstanding balance of the loan s pbrd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd the code provides priority to certain tax liens over the lien of the mortgage in addition substantive requirements are imposed upon mortgage lenders in connection with the origination and the servicing of mortgage loans by numerous federal and some state consumer protection laws these laws include the federal truthinlending act real estate settlement procedures act equal credit opportunity act fair credit billing act fair credit reporting act and related statutes and regulations these federal laws and state laws impose specific statutory liabilities upon lenders who originate or service mortgage loans and who fail to comply with the provisions of the law in some cases this liability may affect assignees of such loans enforceability of certain provisions upon foreclosure courts have imposed general equitable principles these equitable principles are generally designed to relieve the borrower from the legal effect of his defaults under the loan documents examples of judicial remedies that have been fashioned include judicial requirements that the lender undertake affirmative and expensive actions to determine the causes for the borrowers default and the likelihood that the borrower will be able to reinstate the loan in some cases courts have substituted their judgment for the lenders judgment and have required that lenders reinstate loans or recast payment schedules in order to accommodate borrowers who are suffering from temporary financial disability in other cases courts have limited the right of the lender to foreclose if the default under the mortgage instrument is not monetary such as the borrower failing adequately to maintain the property or the borrower executing a second security instrument affecting the property finally some courts have been faced with the issue of whether or not federal or state constitutional provisions reflecting due process concerns for adequate notice require that borrowers under deeds of trust or mortgages receive notices in addition to the statutory prescribed minimum for the most part these cases have upheld the notice provisions as being reasonable or have found that the sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or under a mortgage having a power of sale does not involve sufficient state action to afford constitutional protections to the borrower to the extent that the mortgage loans contain dueonsale clauses the servicer may declare the unpaid amounts thereof due and payable upon the sale or transfer of all or any part of the underlying mortgaged property without the servicers prior written consent the enforceability of dueonsale clauses in certain situations has been restricted by the laws of some states however federal law now preempts state statutory and case law which prohibits enforcement of dueonsale clauses and permits the enforcement of dueonsale clauses subject to certain exceptions the servicer intends to enforce the dueonsale clause contained in any mortgage loan to the extent that it has knowledge of the conveyance or proposed transfer of the underlying mortgaged property and it believes that it is entitled to do so under applicable federal laws and regulations applicability of usury laws title v of the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of  enacted in march  title v provides that state usury

adopting before april   a law or constitutional provision which expressly rejects application of the federal law in addition even where title v is not so rejected any state is authorized by the law to

other charges in the pooling and servicing agreement the seller will represent and warrant that each mortgage loan was originated in compliance with applicable state law in all material respects environmental legislation certain states impose a statutory lien for certain costs on property that is the subject of a cleanup action by the state on account of hazardous wastes or hazardous substances released or disposed of on the property such a lien will generally have priority over all subsequent liens on the property and in certain of these states will have priority over prior recorded liens including the lien of a security instrument in addition under federal environmental legislation and possibly under state law in a number of states a secured party which takes a deed in

group sa loans and group a loans no representation is made that the mortgage loans will prepay at any given percentage of the bpa for federal income tax purposes owners of regular certificates issued with oid must include in gross income original issue discount on an economic accrual basis generally in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such income information with respect to the accrual of oid on regular certificates will be reported annually or more often if required by the trustee to the internal revenue service the service and will also be provided at such times and in the manner required by the service to owners of such regular certificates and relevant brokers and middlemen under current law it is not entirely clear the manner in which income should be accrued on regular interest certificates such as the class sa class sax class a and class ax certificates the payments on which consist solely of interest on a notional principal amount the most reasonable method is to treat all of the income derived from such certificates as constituting oid this is the position that will be taken by remic ii among other possibilities the service could assert that these classes of certificates should instead be taxable under certain treasury regulation provisions governing bonds issued with contingent payments if actual prepayments on the mortgage loans were to differ significantly from the  bpa the calculation of oid for certain classes of offered certificates might produce a negative amount of oid for certain accrual periods negative oid in such event certificateholders of any classes of certificates giving rise to negative oid likely will not be entitled to a deduction for the negative oid amount but instead will be required to carry such amount

backup withholding and information reporting rules described in the prospectus the new regulations attempt to unify certification requirements and modify reliance standards the new regulations will be effective for payments made after december   subject to certain transition rules prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the new regulations special tax considerations applicable to the class ri and class rii certificates the class r certificateholders likely will be required to report an amount of taxable income including excess inclusions which generally may not be offset with any other losses of the holder in earlier accrual periods in respect of their class r certificates significantly in excess of cash distributions received on such certificates for such periods in addition the inclusion of taxable income in respect of the ownership of class r certificates during earlier accrual periods and the deferral of corresponding tax losses or deductions on these certificates until later accrual periods or until the ultimate sale or disposition of a class r certificate or possibly even later pursuant to the application of the wash sale rules under section  of the code may cause the present value of a class r certificateholders resulting tax liabilities attributable to the ownership of a class r certificate to substantially exceed the sum of any tax benefits and any cash distributions on the class r certificate over its life moreover as discussed above and in the prospectus the rules for accrual of original issue discount with respect to certain classes of offered certificates and other remic certificates are subject to significant complexity and uncertainty because original issue discount on applicable certificates will be deducted in determining remic taxable income any changes required by the service in the application of the oid rules to such certificates may significantly affect the timing of the remics original issue discount deductions and therefore the amount of taxable income allocable to holders of class r certificates the remic regulations impose certain restrictions on the transfer or acquisition of certain residual interests including the class r certificates in addition the remic regulations contain restrictions that apply to the transfer of noneconomic residual interest to united states persons the pooling and servicing agreement generally prohibits the transfer of the class r certificates to nonunited states persons as defined therein moreover the remic regulations provide that a transfer to a united states person of a noneconomic residual interest will be disregarded for all federal income tax purposes and the purported transferor of the noneconomic residual interest will continue to remain liable for any taxes due with respect to the income on such residual interest unless no significant purpose of the transfer was to impede the assessment or collection of tax it is expected that the class r certificates will constitute noneconomic residual interests at all times accordingly any purported transfer of a class r certificate to a united states person will not be given effect for federal income tax purposes and the purported transferor will remain liable for any taxes due with respect to the income on the class r certificate unless no significant purpose of such a transfer is

master servicer will be obligated to follow or cause to be followed such normal practices and procedures as it deems necessary or advisable to realize upon the defaulted mortgage loan if the proceeds of any liquidation of the mortgaged property securing the defaulted mortgage loan are less than the principal balance of such mortgage loan plus interest accrued thereon that is payable to

policy it will be entitled to withdraw from the collection account out of related liquidation proceeds or insurance proceeds an amount equal to such expenses incurred by it in which event the trust fund may realize a loss up to the amount so charged since insurance proceeds cannot exceed deficiency claims and certain expenses incurred by the master servicer no such payment or recovery will result in a recovery to the trust fund which exceeds the principal balance of the defaulted mortgage loan together with accrued interest thereon see credit enhancement junior mortgages the mortgage loans underlying the certificates of a series will be secured by mortgages or deeds of trust which may be second or more junior mortgages to other mortgages held by other lenders or institutional investors the rights of the trust fund and therefore the holders of the related certificates as mortgagee under a junior mortgage are subordinate to those of the mortgagee under the senior mortgage including the prior rights of the senior mortgagee to receive hazard insurance and condemnation proceeds and to cause the property securing the mortgage loan to be sold upon default of the mortgagor if the property is sold the junior mortgagees lien will be extinguished unless the junior mortgagee asserts its subordinate interest in the property in foreclosure litigation and possibly satisfies the defaulted senior mortgage a junior mortgagee may satisfy a defaulted senior loan in full and in some states may cure such default and bring the senior loan current in either event adding the amounts expended to the balance due on the junior loan in most states absent a provision in the mortgage or deed of trust no notice of default is required to be given to a junior mortgagee the standard form of the mortgage used by most institutional lenders confers on the mortgagee the right both to receive all proceeds collected under any hazard insurance policy and all awards made in connection with condemnation proceedings and to apply such proceeds and awards to any indebtedness secured by the mortgage in such order as the mortgagee may determine thus in the event improvements on the property are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or in the event the property is taken by condemnation the mortgagee or beneficiary under underlying senior mortgages will have the prior right to collect any insurance proceeds payable under a hazard insurance policy and any award of damages in connection with the  pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th condemnation and to

caused by circumstances beyond the mortgagors control the master servicer or any subservicer is expected to make an effort to avoid foreclosure by entering if feasible into one of a number of available forms of forbearance plans with the mortgagor such plans may involve the reduction or suspension of regular mortgage payments for a specified period with such payments to be made up on or before the maturity date of the mortgage or the recasting of payments due under the mortgage up to or beyond the maturity date in addition when a default caused by such circumstances is accompanied by certain other criteria hud may provide relief by making payments to the master servicer or any subservicer in partial or full satisfaction of amounts due under the mortgage loan which payments are to be repaid by the mortgagor to hud or by accepting assignment of the loan from the master servicer or any subservicer with certain exceptions at least three full monthly installments must be due and

option in most cases to pay insurance claims in cash or in debentures issued by hud currently claims are being paid in cash and claims have not been paid in debentures since  hud debentures issued in satisfaction of fha insurance claims bear interest at the applicable hud debentures interest rate the amount of insurance benefits generally paid by the fha is equal to the entire unpaid principal amount of the defaulted mortgage loan adjusted to reimburse the master servicer or subservicer for certain costs and expenses and to deduct certain amounts received or retained by the master servicer

nature of certain legal matters relating to the mortgage loans because such legal aspects are governed primarily by applicable state law which laws may differ substantially the summaries do not purport to be complete nor to reflect the laws of any particular state nor to encompass the laws of all states in which the security for the mortgage loans is situated the summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the appropriate laws of the states in which mortgage loans may be originated general the mortgage loans will be secured by deeds of trust mortgages security deeds or deeds to secure debt depending upon the prevailing practice in the state in which the property subject to the loan is located deeds of trust are used almost exclusively in california instead of mortgages a mortgage creates a lien upon the real property encumbered by the mortgage which lien is generally not prior to the lien for real estate taxes and assessments priority between mortgages depends on their terms and generally on the order of recording with a state or county office there are two parties to a mortgage the mortgagor who is the borrower and owner of the mortgaged property and the mortgagee who is the lender under the mortgage instrument the mortgagor delivers to the mortgagee a note or bond and the mortgage although a deed of trust is similar to a mortgage a deed of trust formally has three parties the borrowerproperty owner called the grantortrustor similar to a mortgagor a lender called the beneficiary similar to a mortgagee and a thirdparty grantee called the trustee under a deed of trust the borrower grants the property irrevocably until the debt is paid in trust generally with a power of sale to the trustee to secure payment of the obligation a security deed and a deed to secure debt are special types of deeds which indicate on their face that they are granted to secure an underlying debt by executing a security deed or deed to secure debt the grantor conveys title to as opposed to merely creating a lien upon the subject property to the grantee until such time as the underlying debt is repaid the trustees authority under a deed of trust the mortgagees authority under a mortgage and the grantees authority under a security deed or deed to secure debt are governed by law and with respect to some deeds of trust the directions of the beneficiary home ownership and equity protection act of  violations of certain provisions of these federal laws may limit the ability of the master servicer to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on the mortgage loans and in addition could subject the trust fund to damages and administrative enforcement the mortgage loans may be subject to the home ownership and equity protection act of  act which amended the truthinlending act as it applies to mortgages subject to the act the act requires certain additional disclosures specifies the timing of such disclosures and limits or prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in mortgages subject to the act the act also provides that any purchaser or assignee of a mortgage covered by the act is subject to all of the claims and defenses which the borrower could assert against the original lender the maximum damages that may be recovered under the  pbnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd act from an assignee is the remaining amount of indebtedness plus the total amount paid by the borrower in connection with the mortgage loan if the trust fund includes mortgage loans subject to the act it will be subject to all of the claims and defenses which the borrower could assert against a seller any violation of the act which would result in such liability would be a breach of such sellers representations and warranties and such seller would be obligated to cure repurchase or if permitted by the agreement substitute for the mortgage loan in question prepayment charges under certain state laws prepayment charges may not be imposed after a certain period of time following the origination of mortgage loans with respect to prepayments on loans secured by liens encumbering owneroccupied residential properties since many of the mortgaged properties will be owneroccupied it is anticipated that prepayment charges may not be imposed with respect to many of the mortgage loans the absence of such a restraint on prepayment particularly with respect to fixed rate mortgage loans having higher mortgage rates or aprs may increase the likelihood of refinancing or other early retirement of such loans or contracts cooperatives certain of the mortgage loans may be cooperative loans the cooperative owns all the real property that comprises the project including the land separate dwelling units and all common areas the cooperative is directly responsible for project management and in most cases payment of real estate taxes and hazard and liability insurance if there is a blanket mortgage on the cooperative andor underlying land as is generally the case the cooperative as project mortgagor is also responsible for meeting these mortgage obligations a blanket mortgage is ordinarily incurred by the cooperative in connection with the construction or purchase of the cooperatives apartment building the interest of the occupant under proprietary leases or occupancy agreements to which that cooperative is a party are generally subordinate to the interest of the holder of the blanket mortgage in that building if the cooperative is unable to meet the payment obligations arising under its blanket mortgage the mortgagee holding the blanket mortgage could foreclose on that mortgage and terminate all subordinate proprietary leases and occupancy agreements in addition the blanket mortgage on a cooperative may provide financing in the form of a mortgage that does not fully amortize with a significant portion of principal being due in one lump sum at final maturity the inability of the cooperative to refinance this mortgage and its consequent inability to make such final payment could lead to foreclosure by the mortgagee providing the financing a foreclosure in either event by the holder of the blanket mortgage could eliminate or significantly diminish the value of any collateral held by the lender who financed the purchase by an individual tenantstockholder of cooperative shares or in the case of a trust fund including cooperative loans the collateral securing the cooperative loans the cooperative is owned by tenantstockholders who through ownership of stock shares or membership certificates in the corporation receive proprietary leases or occupancy agreements which confer exclusive rights to occupy specific units generally a tenantstockholder of a cooperative must make a monthly payment to the cooperative representing such tenantstockholders pro rata share of the cooperatives payments for its blanket mortgage real property taxes maintenance expenses and other capital or ordinary expenses an ownership interest in a cooperative and accompanying rights is financed through a cooperative share loan evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a security interest in the occupancy agreement or proprietary lease and in the related cooperative shares the lender takes possession of the share certificate and a counterpart of the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement and a financing statement covering the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement and the cooperative shares is filed in the appropriate state and local offices to perfect the lenders interest in its collateral subject to the limitations discussed below upon default of the tenantstockholder the lender may sue for judgment on the promissory note dispose of the collateral at a public or private sale or otherwise proceed against the collateral or tenantstockholder as an individual as provided in the security agreement covering the assignment of the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement and the pledge of cooperative shares  pbrd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd with respect to cooperative loans any prospective purchaser will generally have to obtain the approval of the board of directors of the relevant cooperative before purchasing the shares and acquiring rights under the related proprietary lease or occupancy agreement this approval is usually based on the purchasers income and net worth and numerous other factors although the cooperatives approval is unlikely to be unreasonably withheld or delayed the necessity of acquiring such approval could limit the number of potential purchasers for those shares and otherwise limit the trust funds ability to sell and realize the value of those shares in general a tenantstockholder as defined in code section b of a corporation that qualifies as a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of code section b is allowed a deduction for amounts paid or accrued within his taxable year to the corporation representing his proportionate share of certain interest expenses and certain real estate taxes allowable as a deduction under code section a to the corporation under code sections  and  in order for a corporation to qualify under code section b for its taxable year in which such items are allowable as a deduction to the corporation such section requires among other things that at least  of the gross income of the corporation be derived from its tenantstockholders as defined in code section b by virtue of this requirement the status of a corporation for purposes of code section b must be determined on a yeartoyear basis consequently there can be no assurance that cooperatives relating to the cooperative loans will qualify under such section for any particular year in the event that such a cooperative fails to qualify for one or more years the value of the collateral securing any related cooperative loans could be significantly impaired because no deduction would be allowable to tenantstockholders under code section a with respect to those years in view of the significance of the tax benefits accorded tenantstockholders of a corporation that qualifies under code section b the likelihood that such a failure would be permitted to continue over a period of years appears remote foreclosurerepossession deed of trust foreclosure of a deed of trust is generally accomplished by a nonjudicial sale under a specific provision in the deed of trust which authorizes the trustee to sell the property at public auction upon any default by the borrower under the terms of the note or deed of trust in certain states such foreclosure also may be accomplished by judicial action in the manner provided for foreclosure of mortgages in some states such as california the trustee must record a notice of default and send a copy to the borrowertrustor to any person who has recorded a request for a copy of any notice of default and notice of sale in addition the trustee must provide notice in some states to any other individual having an interest of record in the real property including any junior lienholder if the deed of trust is not reinstated within any applicable cure period a notice of sale must be posted in a public place and in most states including california published for a specified period of time in one or more newspapers in addition these notice provisions require that a copy of the notice of sale be posted on the property and sent to all parties having an interest of record in the property in california the entire process from recording a notice of default to a nonjudicial sale usually takes four to five months in some states including california the borrowertrustor has the right to reinstate the loan at any time following default until shortly before the trustees sale in general the borrower or any other person having a junior encumbrance on the real estate may during a reinstatement period cure the default by paying the entire amount in arrears plus the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the obligation certain state laws control the amount of foreclosure expenses and costs including attorneys fees which may be recoverable by a lender mortgages foreclosure of a mortgage is generally accomplished by judicial action the action is initiated by the service of legal pleadings upon all parties having an interest in the real property delays in completion of the foreclosure may occasionally result from difficulties in locating necessary parties judicial foreclosure proceedings sometimes are not contested by any of the parties when the mortgagees right to foreclosure is contested the legal proceedings necessary to resolve the issue can be time consuming after the completion of a judicial foreclosure proceeding the court generally issues a judgment of foreclosure and appoints a referee or other court officer to conduct the sale of the property in general the borrower or any  pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th other person having a junior encumbrance on the real estate may during a statutorily prescribed reinstatement period cure a monetary default by paying the entire amount in arrears plus other designated costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the obligation generally state law controls the amount of foreclosure expenses and costs including attorneys fees which may be recovered by a lender after the reinstatement period has expired without the default having been cured the borrower or junior lienholder no longer has the right to reinstate the loan and must pay the loan in full to prevent the scheduled foreclosure sale if the deed of trust is not reinstated a notice of sale must be posted in a public place and in most states published for a specific period of time in one or more newspapers in addition some state laws require that a copy of the notice of sale be posted on the property and sent to all parties having an interest in the real property although foreclosure sales are typically public sales frequently no third party purchaser bids in excess of the lenders lien because of the absence of equity in the property the difficulty of determining the exact status of title to the property the possible deterioration of the property during the foreclosure proceedings and a requirement that the purchaser pay to bid for the property thus the foreclosing lender often purchases the property from the trustee or referee for an amount equal to the principal amount outstanding under the loan accrued and unpaid interest and the expenses of foreclosure thereafter the lender will assume the burden of ownership including obtaining hazard insurance and making such repairs at its own expense as are necessary to render the property suitable for sale the lender will commonly obtain the services of a real estate broker and pay the brokers commission in connection with the sale of the property depending upon market conditions the ultimate proceeds of the sale of the property may not equal the lenders investment in the property courts have imposed general equitable principles upon foreclosure these equitable principles are generally designed to relieve the borrower from the legal effect of his defaults under the loan documents examples of judicial remedies that have been fashioned include judicial requirements that the lender undertake affirmative and expensive actions to determine the causes for the borrowers default and the likelihood that the borrower will be able to reinstate the loan in some cases courts have substituted their judgment for the lenders judgment and have required that lenders reinstate loans or recast payment schedules in order to accommodate borrowers who are suffering from temporary financial disability in other cases courts have limited the right of the lender to foreclose if the default under the mortgage instrument is not monetary such as the borrower failing adequately to maintain the property or the borrower executing a second security instrument affecting the property some courts have been faced with the issue of whether federal or state constitutional provisions reflecting due process concerns for fair notice require that borrowers under deeds of trust receive notice longer than that prescribed by statute for the most part these cases have upheld the notice provisions as being reasonable or have found that the sale by a trustee under a deed of trust does not involve sufficient state action to afford constitutional protection to the borrower home equity loans since the mortgages securing home equity loans are often junior liens subordinate to the rights of the mortgagee under the related senior mortgage or mortgages the proceeds from any liquidation insurance or condemnation proceedings will be available to satisfy the outstanding balance of such junior mortgage only to the extent that the claims of such senior mortgagees have been satisfied in full including any related foreclosure costs in addition a junior mortgagee may not foreclose on the property securing a junior mortgage unless it forecloses subject to the senior mortgages in which case it must either pay the entire amount due on the senior mortgages to the senior mortgagees at or prior to the foreclosure sale or undertake the obligation to make payments on the senior mortgages in the event the mortgagor is in default thereunder the trust fund will not have any source of funds to satisfy the senior mortgages to make payments due to the senior mortgagees cooperative loans the cooperative shares owned by the tenantstockholder and pledged to the lender are in almost all cases subject to restrictions on transfer as set forth in the cooperatives certificate of incorporation

typically the lender and the cooperative enter into a recognition agreement which establishes the rights and obligations of both parties in the event of a default by the tenantstockholder on its obligations under the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement a default by the tenantstockholder under the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement will usually constitute a default under the security agreement between the lender and the tenantstockholder the recognition agreement generally provides that in the event that the tenantstockholder has defaulted under the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement the cooperative will take no action to terminate such lease or agreement until the lender has been provided with an opportunity to cure the default the recognition agreement typically provides that if the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement is terminated the cooperative will recognize the lenders lien against proceeds from the sale of the cooperative apartment subject however to the cooperatives right to sums due under such proprietary lease or occupancy agreement the total amount owed to the cooperative by the tenantstockholder which the lender generally cannot restrict and does not monitor could reduce the value of the collateral below the outstanding principal balance of the cooperative loan and accrued and unpaid interest thereon recognition agreements also provide that in the event of a foreclosure on a cooperative loan the lender must obtain the approval or consent of the cooperative as required by the proprietary lease before transferring the cooperative shares or assigning the proprietary lease generally the lender is not limited in any rights it may have to dispossess the tenantstockholders in some states foreclosure on the cooperative shares is accomplished by a sale in accordance with the provisions of article  of the ucc and the security agreement relating to those shares article  of the ucc requires that a sale be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner whether a foreclosure sale has been conducted in a commercially reasonable manner will depend on the facts in each case in determining commercial reasonableness a court will look to the notice given the debtor and the method manner time place and terms of the foreclosure generally a sale conducted according to the usual practice of banks selling similar collateral will be considered reasonably conducted article  of the ucc provides that the proceeds of the sale will be applied first to pay the costs and expenses of the sale and then to satisfy the indebtedness secured by the lenders security interest the recognition agreement however generally provides that the lenders right to reimbursement is subject to the right of the cooperative to receive sums due under the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement if there are proceeds remaining the lender must account to the tenantstockholder for the surplus conversely if a portion of the indebtedness remains unpaid the tenantstockholder is generally responsible for the deficiency see  antideficiency legislation and other limitations on lenders below in the case of foreclosure on a building which was converted from a rental building to a building owned by a cooperative under a noneviction plan some states require that a purchaser at a foreclosure sale take the property subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws which apply to certain tenants who elected to remain in the building but who did not purchase shares in the cooperative when the building was so converted rights of redemption in some states after sale pursuant to a deed of trust or foreclosure of a mortgage the borrower and certain foreclosed junior lienors are given a statutory period in which to redeem the property from the foreclosure sale in certain other states including california this right of redemption applies only to sales following judicial foreclosure and not to sales pursuant to a nonjudicial power of sale in most states where the right of redemption is available statutory redemption may occur upon payment of the foreclosure purchase price accrued interest and taxes in some states the right to redeem is an equitable right the effect of a right of redemption is to diminish the ability of the lender to sell the foreclosed property the exercise of a right of redemption would defeat the title of any purchaser at a foreclosure sale or of any purchaser from the lender subsequent to judicial foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust consequently the practical effect of the redemption right is to force the lender to retain the property and pay the expenses of ownership until the redemption period has run  pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th antideficiency legislation and other limitations on lenders certain states have imposed statutory restrictions that limit the remedies of a beneficiary under a deed of trust or a mortgagee under a mortgage in some states including california statutes limit the right of the beneficiary or mortgagee to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower following foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust a deficiency judgment is a personal judgment against the borrower equal in most cases to the difference between the amount due to the lender and the purchase price offered or paid for the property at the time of the foreclosure sale as a result of these prohibitions it is anticipated that in most instances the servicer will utilize the nonjudicial foreclosure remedy and will not seek deficiency judgments against defaulting mortgagors in some states exceptions to the antideficiency statutes are provided for in certain instances where the value of the lenders security has been impaired by acts or omissions of the borrower for example in the event of waste of the property some state statutes may require the beneficiary or mortgagee to exhaust the security afforded under a deed of trust or mortgage by foreclosure in an attempt to satisfy the full debt before bringing a personal action against the borrower in certain other states the lender has the option of bringing a personal action against the borrower on the debt without first exhausting such security however in some of these states the lender following judgment on such personal action may be deemed to have elected a remedy and may be precluded from exercising remedies with respect to the security consequently the practical effect of the election requirement when applicable is that lenders will usually proceed first against the security rather than bringing a personal action against the borrower in addition to antideficiency and related legislation numerous other federal and state statutory provisions including the federal bankruptcy laws the federal soldiers and sailors civil relief act of  and state laws affording relief to debtors may interfere with or affect the ability of the secured mortgage lender to realize upon its security for example in a proceeding under the federal bankruptcy code a lender may not foreclose on the mortgaged property without the permission of the bankruptcy court the rehabilitation plan proposed by the debtor may provide if the mortgaged property is not the debtors principal residence and the court determines that the value of the mortgaged property is less than the principal balance of the mortgage loan for the reduction of the secured indebtedness to the value of the mortgaged property as of the date of the commencement of the bankruptcy rendering the lender a general unsecured creditor for the difference and also may reduce the monthly payments due under such mortgage loan change the rate of interest and alter the mortgage loan repayment schedule the effect of any such proceedings under the federal bankruptcy code including but not limited to any automatic stay could result in delays in receiving payments on the mortgage loans underlying a series of certificates and possible reductions in the aggregate amount of such payments the mortgage loans are also subject to federal laws including i the federal truthinlending act and regulation z promulgated thereunder which require certain disclosures to the borrowers regarding the terms of the mortgage loans ii the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b promulgated thereunder which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age race color sex religion marital status national origin receipt of public assistance or the exercise of any right under the consumer credit protection act in the extension of credit iii the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the borrowers credit experience and iv the home ownership and equity protection act of  these and other federal and state consumer protection laws impose substantive requirements upon mortgage lenders in connection with the origination servicing and enforcement of mortgage loans violations of certain provisions of these laws may limit the ability of the master servicer to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on the mortgage loans may subject the master servicer to damages and administrative enforcement and in addition could be raised by borrowers as a recoupment or setoff in a collection or  pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th foreclosure action the federal tax laws provide priority to certain tax liens over the lien of a mortgage or secured party generally article  of the ucc governs foreclosure on cooperative shares and the related proprietary lease or occupancy agreement some courts have interpreted section  of the ucc to prohibit a deficiency award unless the creditor establishes that the sale of the collateral which in the case of a cooperative loan would be the shares of the cooperative and the related proprietary lease or occupancy agreement was conducted in a commercially reasonable manner environmental risks real property pledged as security to a lender may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks under the laws of certain states contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to assure the payment of the costs of cleanup in several states such a lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property in addition under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  cercla the united states environmental protection agency epa may impose a lien on property where epa has incurred cleanup costs however a cercla lien is subordinate to preexisting perfected security interests under the laws of some states and under cercla it is conceivable that a lender may be held liable as an owner or operator for costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a mortgaged property regardless of whether or not the environmental damage or threat was caused by a prior owner or operator cercla imposes liability on any and all responsible parties which includes inter alia the property owner and operator for the cost of cleanup of releases of hazardous substances however cercla excludes from the definition of owner or operator secured creditors who hold indicia of ownership for the purpose of protecting their security interest but without participating in the management of the facility that exclusion was substantially narrowed by a may  decision of the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in united states v fleet factors corp which held that a lender need not have involved itself in the daytoday operations of the facility or participated in decisions relating to hazardous waste management in order to be liable rather liability could attach to the lender if its involvement with the management of the facility is broad enough to support the inference that the lender could affect hazardous waste management practices if it so chose the court added that a lenders capacity to influence such decisions could be inferred from the extent of its involvement in the facilitys financial management in response to fleet factors epa promulgated regulations designed to clarify the range of activities a lender may engage in without losing the benefit of the statutory exclusion under the regulations which took effect in april  a lender is permitted to monitor the borrowers environmental practices in order to determine if the facility is in compliance with applicable law and to require the borrower to take measures necessary to achieve or maintain compliance or conduct necessary cleanups the lender may not however exercise control over or assume responsibility for the borrowers environmental practices such actions would be considered participation in the management of the facility also if the lender takes title to or possession of the property it might be deemed to have obviated the security interest exclusion and to be liable for cleanup costs pursuant to cercla the epa regulations allow lenders to take certain actions with respect to foreclosure without losing the benefit of the statutory exclusion essentially the regulations allow the lender to take actions consistent with protecting its security interest but not actions which demonstrate an intent to exercise longterm ownership interest in the property while the epa regulations offer some protection to lenders it must be noted that such protection may not be available under applicable state law furthermore the regulations are binding only on epa with respect to epas enforcement powers and cost recovery rights it has not yet been determined whether the federal courts will apply the regulations in cost recovery actions brought against lenders by other responsible parties although the regulations may well be considered persuasive by the courts two judicial challenges have been brought against the epa regulations in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the challenges both allege that the regulations are inconsistent with the statutory requirements of cercla and

costs associated with environmental cleanup may be substantial it is conceivable that such remedial costs arising from the circumstances set forth above would become a liability of the trust fund and occasion a loss to certificateholders court decisions have taken varying views of the scope of the securedcreditor exemption leading to administrative and legislative efforts to provide guidance to lenders on the scope of activities that would trigger cercla andor rcra liability until recently these efforts have failed to provide substantial guidance on october   however the president signed into law legislation intended to clarify the scope of the securedcreditor exemption under both cercla and rcra this legislation more explicitly defined the kinds of participation in management that would trigger liability under cercla and specified certain activities that would not constitute participation in management or otherwise result in a forfeiture of the securedcreditor exemption prior to foreclosure or during a workout period the legislation also clarifies the extent of protection against liability under cercla in the event of foreclosure the legislation also authorizes certain regulatory clarifications of the scope of the securedcreditor exemption for purposes of the recourse conservation and recovery act similar to the statutory protections under cercla however since the courts have not yet had the opportunity to interpret the new statutory provisions the scope of the additional protections offered by the asset conservation act is not fully defined it also is important to note that the asset conservation act does not offer complete protection to lenders and that the risk of liability remains except as otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement at the time the mortgage loans were originated no environmental assessment or a very limited environmental assessment of the mortgaged properties was conducted dueonsale clauses unless otherwise provided in the related prospectus supplement each conventional mortgage loan will contain a dueonsale clause which will generally provide that if the mortgagor or obligor sells transfers or conveys the mortgaged property the loan may be accelerated by the mortgagee in recent years court decisions and legislative actions placed substantial restriction on the right of lenders to enforce such clauses in many states for instance the california supreme court in august  held that dueonsale clauses were generally unenforceable however the garnst germain depository institutions act of  the garnst germain act subject to certain exceptions preempts state constitutional statutory and case law prohibiting the enforcement of dueonsale clauses as to loans secured by an owneroccupied residence the garnst germain act sets forth nine specific instances in which a mortgagee covered by the act may not exercise its rights under a dueonsale clause notwithstanding the fact that a transfer of the property may have occurred the inability to enforce a dueonsale clause may result in transfer of the related mortgaged property to an uncreditworthy person which could increase the likelihood of default or may result in a mortgage bearing an interest rate below the current market rate being assumed by a new home buyer which may affect the average life of the mortgage loans and the number of mortgage loans which may extend to maturity prepayment charges under certain state laws prepayment charges may not be imposed after a certain period of time following the origination of mortgage loans with respect to prepayments on loans secured by liens encumbering owneroccupied residential properties since many of the mortgaged properties will be owneroccupied it is anticipated that prepayment charges may not be imposed with respect to many of the mortgage loans the absence of such a restraint on prepayment particularly with respect to fixedrate mortgage loans having higher mortgage rates

between the portion of the prepaid principal amount of the mortgage loan that is allocable to the certificate and the portion of the adjusted basis of the certificate that is allocable to the mortgage

 shall be treated as ordinary income to the extent that it does not exceed the accrued market discount at the time of such payment the amount of accrued market discount for purposes of determining the tax treatment of subsequent principal payments or dispositions of the market discount bond is to be reduced by the amount so treated as ordinary income the code also grants the treasury department authority to issue regulations providing for the computation of accrued market discount on debt instruments the principal of which is payable in more than one installment the treasury department has not yet issued any such regulations however the relevant legislative history provides the best guidance applicable to this situation under certain analogous rules set forth in the code and pursuant to the legislative history the holder of such a market discount bond may elect to accrue market discount either on the basis of a constant interest rate or according to one of the following methods if a senior certificate is issued with original issue discount the amount of market discount that accrues during any accrual period would be equal to the product of i the total remaining market discount multiplied by ii a fraction the numerator of which is the original issue discount accruing during the period and the denominator of which is the total remaining original issue discount at the beginning of the accrual period for senior certificates issued without original issue discount the amount of market discount that accrues during a period is equal to the product of i the total remaining market discount multiplied by ii a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of stated interest paid during the accrual period and the denominator of which is the total amount of stated interest remaining to be paid at the beginning of the accrual period for purposes of calculating market discount under any of the above methods in the case of instruments such as the senior certificates which provide for payments which may be accelerated by reason of prepayments of other obligations securing such instruments the same prepayment assumption applicable to calculating the accrual of original issue discount will apply because the regulations described above have not yet been issued it is not possible to predict what effect those regulations might have on the tax treatment of a senior certificate purchased at a discount or premium in the secondary market a holder who acquires a senior certificate at a market discount also may be required to defer until the maturity date of such senior certificate or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction the deduction of a portion of the amount of interest that the holder paid or accrued during the taxable year on any indebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry the senior certificate in excess of the aggregate amount of interest including original issue discount includable in such holders gross income for the taxable year with respect to such senior certificate the amount of such net interest expense deferred in a taxable year may not exceed the amount of market discount accrued on the senior certificate for the days during the taxable year on which the holder held the senior certificate and in general would be deductible when such market discount is includable in income the amount of any remaining deferred deduction is to be taken into account in the taxable year in which the senior certificate matures or is disposed of in a taxable transaction in the case of a disposition in which gain or loss is not recognized in whole or in part any remaining deferred deduction will be allowed to the extent of gain recognized on the disposition this deferral rule does not apply if the

accounting method on a statement attached to their first timely tax return filed after august   the precise tax treatment of stripped coupon certificates is substantially uncertain the code could be read literally to require that original issue discount computations be made on a loan by loan basis certain irs guidance would appear to suggest that a stripped coupon certificate be treated as a single installment obligation subject to the original issue discount rules of the code under this characterization all payments on a stripped coupon certificate would be included in the certificates stated redemption price at maturity for purposes of calculating income on such certificate under the original issue discount rules of the code it is unclear under what circumstances if any the prepayment of mortgage loans will give rise to a loss to the holder of a stripped bond certificate purchased at a premium or a stripped coupon certificate if such certificate is treated as a single instrument rather than an interest in discrete mortgage loans and the effect of prepayments is taken into account in computing yield with respect to such senior certificate it appears that no loss may be available as a result of any particular prepayment unless prepayments occur at a rate faster than the assumed prepayment rate however if such certificate is treated as an interest in discrete mortgage loans or if no prepayment assumption is used then when a mortgage loan is prepaid the holder of such certificate should be able to recognize a loss equal to the portion of the adjusted issue

specifying whether the character of senior certificates issued in connection with the issuance of a multiple class of senior certificates will necessarily be treated the same as that of the underlying mortgage loans for purposes of these provisions for example while code section  treats a stripped obligation as a separate obligation for purposes of the code provisions addressing original issue discount as described above there is some uncertainty whether such characterization would necessarily apply with regard to other code sections nevertheless unless otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement as to each class of senior certificates kilpatrick stockton llp will render its opinion that although the issue is not free from doubt based on policy considerations each class of senior certificates should be considered to represent qualifying real property loans within the meaning of code section d real estate assets within the meaning of code section ca and loans    secured by an interest in real property which is    residential real property within the meaning of code section acv and interest income attributable to senior certificates should be considered to represent interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property within the meaning of code section cb provided that in each case the underlying mortgage loans and interest on such mortgage loans qualify for such treatment in addition such opinion will opine that senior certificates will be obligations including any participation or certificate of beneficial ownership therein which are principally secured by an interest in real property within the meaning of code section ga offered certificates representing interests in loans other than arms original issue discount on a senior certificate representing an interest in a mortgage loan must be included in the owners ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with a constant interest method that takes into account the compounding of interest in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to such income the amount of original issue discount required to be included in an owners income in any taxable year with respect to a senior certificate representing an interest in mortgage loans other than arms likely will be computed as described below under   accrual of original issue discount the following discussion is based in part on treasury regulations under code sections  through  and  the oid regulations and in part on the provisions of the tax reform act of  the  act in general under the code original issue discount is equal to the excess of a debt instruments stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price the issue price of a debt instrument as to any purchaser is generally equal to the price paid by such purchaser for the debt instrument the stated redemption price at maturity of a debt instrument is the sum of all payments to be made on such debt instrument other than payments that are treated as qualified stated interest payments the accrual of original issue discount on a senior certificate representing an interest in mortgage loans as described below under accrual of original issue discount will unless otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement utilize the original yield to maturity of the senior certificate to compute any original issue discount as calculated based on a reasonable assumed prepayment rate for the mortgage loans underlying the senior certificate the prepayment assumption and taking into account events that occur during the calculation period the prepayment assumption is required to be determined in the manner prescribed by regulations which regulations have not yet been issued the legislative history of the  act the legislative history provides however that the regulations will require that the prepayment assumption be the prepayment assumption that is used in determining the offering price of such certificate no representation is made that such certificate will prepay at the prepayment assumption or at any other rate although the existing authority literally only apply to debt instruments collateralized by mortgages that are subject to prepayment rather than direct ownership interests such as the senior certificates in mortgages because no other legal authority provides guidance with regard to the proper method for accruing original issue discount on obligations that are subject to prepayment until treasury regulations or other legal authority instructs  pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th otherwise the master servicer intends to calculate and report original issue discount under the method described below accrual of original issue discount generally the owner of a senior certificate must include in gross income the sum of the daily portions as defined below of the original issue discount on such senior certificate for each day on which it owns a senior certificate including the date of purchase but excluding the date of disposition in the case of an original owner the daily portions of original issue discount with respect to each component generally will be determined as follows under the existing authority a calculation will be made by the master servicer or such other entity specified in the related prospectus supplement of the portion of original issue discount that accrues during each successive monthly accrual period or shorter period from the date of original issue that ends on the day in the calendar year corresponding to each of the distribution dates on the senior certificate or the day prior to each such date this will be done in the case of each full month accrual period by adding i the present value at the end of the accrual period determined by using as a discount factor the original yield to maturity of the respective component under the prepayment assumption of all remaining payments to be received under the prepayment assumption on the respective component and ii any payments received during such accrual period and subtracting from that total the adjusted issue price of the respective component at the beginning of such accrual period the adjusted issue price of a senior certificate at the beginning of the first accrual period is its issue price the adjusted issue price of a senior certificate at the beginning of a subsequent accrual period is the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the immediately preceding accrual period plus the amount of original issue discount allocable to that accrual period reduced by the amount of any payment made at the end of or during that accrual period the original issue discount accruing during such accrual period will then be divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of original issue discount for each day in the period with respect to an initial accrual period shorter than a full monthly accrual period the daily portions of original issue discount must be determined according to an appropriate allocation under any reasonable method senior certificates representing interests in arm loans the oid regulations do not address the treatment of instruments such as the senior certificates which represent interests in mortgage loans with mortgage rates which adjust periodically arm loans additionally the irs has not issued guidance under the codes coupon stripping rules with respect to such instruments in the absence of any authority the master servicer will report original issue discount on senior certificates attributable to arm loans stripped arm obligations to holders in a manner it believes is consistent with the rules described above under the heading  senior certificates representing interests in loans other than arm loans and with the oid regulations in general application of these rules may require inclusion of income on a stripped arm obligation in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income further the addition of interest deferred by reason of negative amortization deferred interest to the principal balance of an arm loan may require the inclusion of such amount in the income of the senior certificateholder when such amount accrues furthermore the addition of deferred interest to the senior certificates principal balance will result in additional income including possibly original issue discount income to the senior certificateholder over the remaining life of such senior certificates because the treatment of stripped

in the case of an investor having a right to shares of the interest and principal payments on a mortgage loan where the share of interest is not substantially greater than the share of principal the

loan is more likely to be regarded as contingent if held by an investor that does not also hold a right to the related principal such an investor would not recover its capital through receipt of a principal payment at the time of the prepayment of the mortgage loan applying these principles to the senior certificates because the mortgage loans are subject to prepayment at any time payments on a class of senior certificates representing a right to interest on the mortgage loans could be considered to be contingent within the meaning of the oid regulations at least if the right is to interest only or if such senior certificate was issued at a premium the likelihood that such payments will be considered contingent increases the greater the amount of such premium the irs recently issued regulations the final contingent debt regulations governing the calculation of oid on instruments having contingent interest payments the final contingent debt regulations which apply to debt instruments issued on or after august   specifically do not apply similar to the proposed contingent debt regulations for purposes of calculating oid on debt instruments subject to principal acceleration under code section a such as the senior certificates likely represent in the event that payments on a senior certificate in respect of interest on the mortgage loans were considered contingent the holder would generally report income or loss as described above under  multiple classes of senior certificates  stripped bonds and stripped coupons except that the yield that would be used in calculating interest income would not be the actual yield but would instead equal the applicable federal rate the afr generally an average of current yields of treasury securities computed and published monthly by the irs in effect at the time of purchase of such senior certificate by such holder in addition once such holders adjusted basis in such senior certificate has been reduced by prior distributions or losses to an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the remaining noncontingent payments of the mortgage loans that are allocable to such senior certificate or to zero if such senior certificate does not share in principal payments then such holder would recognize income in each subsequent month equal to the full amount of interest on the mortgage loans that accrues in that month and is allocable to such senior certificate it is uncertain whether under the contingent payment rules any other adjustments would be made to take account of prepayments of the mortgage loans sale or exchange of a senior certificate sale or exchange of a senior certificate prior to its maturity will result in gain or loss equal to the difference if any between the amount received and the

discount are set forth in code sections  through  and  these rules require that the amount and rate of accrual of original issue discount be calculated based on a prepayment assumption and prescribe a method for adjusting the amount and rate of accrual of such discount where the actual prepayment rate differs from the prepayment assumption under the code the prepayment assumption is required to be determined in the manner prescribed by regulations which have not yet been issued the legislative history provides however that congress intended the regulations to require that the prepayment assumption be the prepayment assumption that is used in determining the initial offering price of such regular certificates the prospectus supplement for each series of regular certificates will specify the prepayment assumption to be used for the purpose of determining the amount and rate of accrual of original issue discount no representation is made that the regular certificates will prepay at the prepayment assumption or at any other rate in general each regular certificate will be treated as a single installment obligation issued with an amount of original issue discount equal to the excess if any of its stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price the issue price of a regular certificate will generally be the first price at which a substantial amount of regular certificates of that class are first sold to the public excluding bond houses brokers underwriters or wholesalers the issue price of a regular certificate also will include the amount paid by an initial regular certificateholder if any for accrued interest that relates to a period prior to the issue date of the regular certificate the stated redemption price at maturity of a regular certificate will equal all payments to be made on the certificate other than payments which constitute qualified stated interest under the oid regulations qualified stated interest generally means interest payable at a single fixed rate or qualified variable rate as described below provided that such interest payments are unconditionally payable at intervals of one year or less during the entire term of the regular certificate interest is payable at a single fixed rate only if the rate appropriately takes into account the length of the interval between payments distributions of interest on regular certificates with respect to which deferred interest will accrue will not constitute qualified stated interest payments in which case the stated redemption price at maturity of such regular certificates includes all distributions of interest as well as principal thereon where the interval between the issue date and the first distribution date on a regular certificate is either longer or shorter than the interval between subsequent distribution dates all or part of the interest foregone in the case of the longer interval and all of the additional interest in the case of the shorter interval will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity and tested under the de minimis rule described below the oid regulations suggest that all interest on a long first period regular certificate that is issued with nonde minimis oid may be treated as oid regular certificateholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the issue price and stated redemption price at maturity of a regular certificate under the de minimis rule original issue discount on a regular certificate will be considered to be zero if such original issue discount is less than  of the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the regular certificate for this purpose the weighted average maturity of the regular certificate is computed as the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the number of full years ie rounding down partial years from the issue date until each distribution in reduction of stated redemption price at maturity is scheduled to be made by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of each distribution included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate and the denominator of which is the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate although currently unclear it appears that the schedule of such distributions should be determined in accordance with the prepayment assumption the prepayment assumption with respect to a series of regular certificates will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement holders

the amount of original issue discount allocable to that accrual period and reduced by the amount of any payment other than a payment of stated periodic interest made at the end of or during that accrual period the original issue discount accrued during an accrual period will then be divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of original issue discount for each day in the accrual period the calculation of original issue discount under the method described above will cause the accrual of original issue discount to either increase or decrease but never below zero in a given accrual period to reflect the fact that prepayments are occurring faster or slower than under the prepayment assumption with respect to an initial accrual period shorter than a full accrual period the daily portions of original issue discount may be determined according to an appropriate allocation under any reasonable method a subsequent purchaser of a regular certificate issued with original issue discount who purchases the regular certificate at a cost less than the remaining stated redemption price at maturity will also be required to include in gross income the sum of the daily portions of original issue discount on that regular certificate in computing the daily portions of original issue discount for such a purchaser as well as an initial purchaser that purchases at a price higher than the adjusted issue price but less than the stated redemption price at maturity however the daily portion is reduced by the amount that would be the daily portion for such day

traded personal property certain proposed oid regulations  pbst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st would expand the definition of objective rate to include any rate other than a qualified floating rate that is determined using a single fixed formula and that is based on objective financial or economic information provided that such information is not i within the control of the issuer or a related party or ii unique to the circumstances of the issuer or a related party a qualified inverse floating rate is a rate equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate that inversely reflects contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds an inverse floating rate that is not a qualified inverse floating rate may nevertheless be an objective rate a class of regular certificates may be issued that does not have a variable rate under the foregoing rules for example a class that bears different rates at different times during the period it is outstanding such that it is considered significantly frontloaded or backloaded within the meaning of the oid regulations it is possible that such a class may be considered to bear contingent interest within the meaning of the oid regulations and the proposed oid regulations the proposed oid regulations as they relate to the treatment of contingent interest are by their terms not applicable to regular certificates however if final regulations dealing with contingent interest with respect to regular certificates apply the same principles as the proposed oid regulations such regulations may lead to different timing of income inclusion than would be the case under the oid regulations furthermore application of such principles could lead to the characterization of gain on the sale of contingent interest regular certificates as ordinary income under the remic regulations a regular certificate i bearing a rate that qualifies as a variable rate under the oid regulations that is tied to current values of a variable rate or the highest lowest or average of two or more variable rates including a rate based on the average cost of funds of one or more financial institutions or a positive or negative multiple of such a rate plus or minus a specified number of basis points or that represents a weighted average of rates on some or all of the mortgage loans including such a rate that is subject to one or more caps or floors or ii bearing one or more such variable rates for one or more periods or one or more fixed rates for one or more periods and a different variable rate or fixed rate for other periods qualifies as a regular interest in a remic accordingly unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement the depositor intends to treat regular certificates that qualify

regular certificate bearing a variable rate of interest will accrue in the manner described above under  original issue discount with the yield to maturity and future payments on such regular certificate generally to be determined by assuming that interest will be payable for the life of the regular certificate based on the initial rate or if different the value of the applicable variable rate as of the pricing date for the relevant class unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement the depositor intends to treat such variable interest as qualified stated interest other than variable interest on an interestonly or superpremium class which will be treated as nonqualified stated interest includable in the stated redemption price at maturity ordinary income reportable for any period will be adjusted based on subsequent changes in the applicable interest rate index unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement the depositor intends to treat regular certificates bearing an interest rate that is a weighted average of the net interest rates on mortgage loans as having qualified stated interest in the case of adjustable rate mortgage loans the applicable index used to compute interest on the mortgage loans in effect on the pricing date or possibly the issue date will be deemed to be in effect beginning with the period in which the first weighted average adjustment date occurring after the issue date occurs adjustments will be made in each accrual period either increasing or decreasing the amount of ordinary income reportable to reflect the actual passthrough rate on the regular certificates market discount a purchaser of a regular certificate may also be subject to the market discount provisions of code sections  through  under these provisions and the oid regulations market discount equals the excess if any of i the regular certificates stated principal amount or in the case of a regular certificate with original issue discount the adjusted issue price determined for this purpose as if the purchaser had purchased such regular certificate from an original holder over ii the price for such regular certificate paid by the purchaser a certificateholder that purchases a remic regular certificate at a market discount will recognize income upon receipt of each distribution representing stated redemption

market discount not previously included in income and to recognize ordinary income to that extent a certificateholder may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues rather than including it on a deferred basis in accordance with the foregoing if made such election will apply to all market discount bonds acquired by such certificateholder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which such election applies in addition the oid regulations permit a certificateholder using the accrual method of accounting to elect to accrue all interest discount including de minimis market or original issue discount and premium in income as interest based on a constant yield method if such an election were made with respect to a remic regular certificate with market discount the certificateholder is deemed to have made an election to include in income currently market discount with respect to all other debt instruments having market discount that such certificateholder acquires during the year of the election or thereafter similarly a certificateholder that makes this election for a certificate that is acquired at a premium is deemed to have made an election to amortize bond premium with respect to all debt instruments having amortizable bond premium that such certificateholder owns or acquires see  regular certificates  premium the election to accrue interest discount and premium on a constant yield method with respect to a certificate is irrevocable market discount with respect to a regular certificate will be considered to be zero if the amount allocable to the regular certificate is less than  of the regular certificates stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the regular certificates weighted average maturity remaining after the date of purchase if market discount on a regular certificate is considered to be zero under this rule the actual amount of market discount must be allocated to the remaining principal payments on the regular certificate and gain equal to such allocated amount will be recognized when the corresponding principal payment is made treasury regulations implementing the market discount rules have not yet been issued therefore investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules and the advisability of making any of the elections allowed under code sections  through  the code provides that any principal payment whether a scheduled payment or a prepayment or any gain on disposition of a market discount bond shall be treated as ordinary income to the extent that it does not exceed the accrued market discount at the time of such payment the amount of accrued market discount for purposes of determining the tax treatment of subsequent principal payments or dispositions of the market discount bond is to be reduced by the amount so treated as ordinary income the code also grants authority to the treasury department to issue regulations providing for the computation of accrued market discount on debt instruments the principal of which is payable in more than one installment until such time as regulations are issued by the treasury rules described in the legislative history will apply under those rules the holder of a market discount bond may elect to accrue market discount either on the basis of a constant interest rate or according to one of the following methods for regular certificates issued with original issue discount the amount of market discount that accrues during a period is equal to the product of i the total remaining market discount multiplied by ii a fraction the numerator of which is the original issue discount accruing during the period and the denominator of which is the total remaining original issue discount at the beginning of the period for regular certificates issued without original issue discount the amount of market discount that accrues during a period is equal to the product of a the total remaining market discount and b a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of stated interest paid during the accrual period and the denominator of which is the total amount of stated interest remaining to be paid at the beginning of the period for purposes of calculating market discount under any of the above methods in the case of instruments such as the regular certificates which provide for payments which may be accelerated by reason of prepayments of other obligations securing such instruments the same prepayment assumption applicable to calculating the accrual of original issue discount will apply a holder of a regular certificate that acquires such regular certificate at a market discount also may be required to defer until the maturity date of such regular

of market discount accrued on the regular certificate for the days during the taxable year on which the holder held the regular certificate and in general would be deductible when such market discount is includable in income the amount of any remaining deferred deduction is to be taken into account in the taxable year in which the regular certificate matures or is disposed of in a taxable transaction in the case of a disposition in which gain or loss is not recognized in whole or in part any remaining deferred deduction will be allowed to the extent of gain recognized on the disposition this deferral rule does not apply if the regular certificateholder elects to include such market discount in income currently as it accrues on all market discount obligations acquired by such regular certificateholder in that taxable year or thereafter premium a purchaser of a regular certificate that purchases the regular certificate at a cost not including accrued qualified stated interest greater than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity will be considered to have purchased the regular certificate at a premium and may elect to amortize such premium under a constant yield method it is not clear whether the prepayment assumption would be taken into account in determining the life of the regular certificate for this purpose however the legislative history states that the same rules that apply to accrual of market discount which rules require use of a prepayment assumption in accruing market discount with respect to regular certificates without regard to whether such certificates have original issue discount will also apply in amortizing bond premium under code section  the code provides that amortizable bond premium will be allocated among the interest payments on such regular certificates and will be applied as an offset against such interest payment deferred interest certain classes of regular certificates may provide for the accrual of interest when one or more arm loans are adding interest to their principal balance by reason of negative amortization deferred interest any deferred interest that accrues with respect to a class of regular certificates will constitute income to the holders of such certificates prior to the time distributions of cash with respect to such deferred interest are made it is unclear under the oid regulations whether any of the interest on such certificates will constitute qualified stated interest or whether all or a portion of the interest payable on the certificates must be included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the certificate and accounted for as original issue discount which could accelerate such inclusion interest on regular certificates must in any event be accounted for under an accrual method by the holders of such certificates and therefore applying the latter analysis may result only in a slight difference in the timing of the inclusion in income of interest on such regular certificates effects of defaults and delinquencies certain series of certificates may contain one or more classes of subordinate certificates and in the event there are defaults or delinquencies on the mortgage loans amounts that would otherwise be distributed on the subordinate certificates may instead be distributed on the senior certificates holders of subordinate certificates nevertheless will be required to report income with respect to such certificates under an accrual method without giving effect to delays and reductions in distributions on such subordinate certificates attributable to defaults and delinquencies on the mortgage loans except to the extent that it can be established that such amounts are uncollectible as a result the amount of income reported by a holder of a subordinate certificate in any period could significantly exceed the amount of cash distributed to such holder in that period the holder will eventually be allowed a loss or will be allowed to report a lesser amount of income to the extent that the aggregate amount of distributions on the subordinate certificate is reduced as a result of defaults and delinquencies on the mortgage loans however the law is unclear with respect to the timing and character of such losses or reductions in income and accordingly holders of subordinate certificates should consult their own tax advisors on this point sale exchange or redemption upon the sale exchange or redemption of a regular certificate the holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on such disposition and the holders adjusted basis in the regular certificate such adjusted basis generally will equal the cost of the regular certificate to the holder increased by any original issue discount and market discount included in the holders gross income with respect to the regular certificate and reduced but not below zero by payments included in the stated redemption price at maturity previously received by the holder and by any amortized premium except as provided in the following paragraph and as provided under market discount above  pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss provided that the regular certificate is held as a capital asset generally property held for investment within the meaning of code section  gain from the sale or other disposition of a regular certificate that might otherwise be capital gain will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that such gain does not exceed the excess if any of i the amount that would have been includable in such holders income with respect to the regular certificate had income accrued thereon at a rate equal to  of the afr as defined in code section d determined as of the date of purchase of such regular certificate over ii the amount actually includable in such holders income regular certificates will be evidences of indebtedness within the meaning of code section c so that gain or loss recognized from the sale or exchange of a regular certificate by a bank or a thrift institution to which such section applies will be ordinary income or loss the regular certificate information reports will include a statement of the adjusted issue price of the regular certificate at the beginning of each accrual period in addition the reports will include information necessary to compute the accrual of any market discount that may arise upon secondary trading of regular certificates because exact computation of the accrual of market discount on a constant yield method would require information relating to the holders purchase price which the remic may not have it appears that the information reports will only require information pertaining to the appropriate proportionate method of accruing market discount noninterest expenses of the remic under the remic regulations if the remic is considered to be a singleclass remic a portion of the remics servicing administrative and other noninterest expenses will be allocated as a separate item to those regular certificateholders that are

exempt from withholding distributions of interest including distributions in respect of accrued original issue discount such holder may be subject to a  withholding tax subject to reduction under any applicable tax treaty further it appears that a remic regular certificate would not be included in the estate of a nonresident alien individual and would not be subject to united states estate taxes however certificateholders who are nonresident alien individuals should consult their tax advisors concerning this question regular certificateholders who are nonus persons and persons related to such

remic to the residual certificates the remic will not be subject to federal income tax except with respect to income from prohibited transactions and certain other transactions see prohibited transactions and other taxes herein instead each original holder of a residual certificate will report on its federal income tax return as ordinary income its share of the taxable income of the remic for each day during the taxable year on which such holder owns any residual certificates the taxable income of the remic for each day will be determined by allocating the taxable income of the remic for each calendar quarter ratably to each day in the quarter such a holders share of the taxable income of the remic for each day will be based on the portion of the outstanding residual certificates that such holder owns on that day the taxable income of the remic will be determined under an accrual method and will be taxable to the residual certificateholders without regard to the timing or amounts of cash distributions by the remic ordinary income derived from residual certificates will be portfolio income for purposes of the taxation of taxpayers subject to the limitations on the deductibility of passive losses as residual interests the residual certificates will be subject to tax rules described below that differ from those that would apply if the residual certificates were treated for federal income tax purposes as direct ownership interests in the assets of the trust fund or as debt instruments issued by the remic a residual certificateholder may be required to include taxable income from the residual certificate in excess of the cash distributed for example a structure where principal distributions are made serially on regular interests that is a fastpay slowpay structure may generate such a mismatching of income and cash distributions this mismatching may be caused by the use of certain required tax accounting methods by the remic variations in the prepayment rate of the underlying mortgage loans and certain other factors depending upon the structure of a particular transaction the aforementioned factors may significantly reduce the aftertax yield of a residual certificate to a residual certificateholder investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the federal income tax treatment of a residual certificate and the impact of such tax treatment on the aftertax yield of a residual certificate a subsequent residual certificateholder also will report on its federal income tax return amounts representing a daily share of the taxable income of the remic for each day that such residual certificateholder owns such residual certificate those daily amounts generally would equal the amounts that would have been reported for the same days by an original residual certificateholder as described above the legislative history indicates that certain adjustments may be appropriate to reduce or increase the income of a subsequent holder of a residual certificate that purchased such residual certificate at a price greater than or less than the adjusted basis such residual certificate would have in the hands of an original residual certificateholder see sale or exchange of residual certificates below it is not clear however whether such adjustments will in fact be permitted or required and if so how they would be made the remic regulations do not provide for any such adjustments excess inclusions a portion of the income on a residual certificate referred to in the code as an excess inclusion for any calendar quarter will with an exception discussed below for certain thrift institutions be subject to federal income tax in all events thus for example an excess inclusion i may not except as described below be offset by any unrelated losses deductions or loss carryovers of a residual certificateholder ii will be treated as unrelated business taxable income within the meaning of code section  if the residual certificateholder is a pension fund or any other organization that is subject to tax only on its unrelated business taxable income see taxexempt investors below and iii is not eligible for any reduction in the rate of withholding tax in the case of a residual certificateholder that is a foreign investor see nonus persons below the exception for thrift institutions is available only to

certificateholder for that calendar quarter from its residual certificate over ii the sum of the daily accruals as defined below for all days during the calendar quarter on which the residual certificateholder holds such residual certificate for this purpose the daily accruals with respect to a residual certificate are determined by allocating to each day in the calendar quarter its ratable portion of the product of the adjusted issue price as defined below of the residual certificate at the beginning of the calendar quarter and  percent of the federal longterm rate in effect at the time the residual certificate is issued for this purpose the adjusted issue price of a residual certificate at the beginning of any calendar quarter equals the issue price of the residual certificate increased by the amount of daily accruals for all prior quarters and decreased but not below zero by the aggregate amount of payments made on the residual certificate before the beginning of such quarter the federal longterm rate is an average of current yields on treasury securities with a remaining term of greater than nine years computed and published monthly by the irs as an exception to the general rule described above the treasury department has authority to issue regulations that would treat the entire amount of income accruing on a residual certificate as excess inclusions if the residual certificates in the aggregate are considered not to have significant value under the remic regulations residual certificateholders that are thrift institutions described in code section  can offset excess inclusions with unrelated deductions losses and loss carryovers provided the residual certificates have significant value for purposes of applying this rule thrift institutions that are members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return together with their subsidiaries formed to issue remics are treated as separate corporations residual certificates have significant value if i the residual certificates have an aggregate issue price that is at least equal to  of the aggregate issue price of all residual certificates and regular certificates with respect to the remic and ii the anticipated weighted average life of the residual certificates is at least  of the anticipated weighted average life of the remic based on the anticipated principal payments to be received with respect thereto using the prepayment assumption and any required or permitted clean up calls or required liquidation provided for in the remics organizational documents except that all anticipated distributions are to be used if the residual certificate is not entitled to any principal payments or is entitled to a disproportionately small portion relative to interest payments thereon the principal amount will be considered disproportionately small if the issue price of the residual certificates exceeds  of their initial principal amount finally an ordering rule under the remic regulations provides that a thrift institution may only offset its excess inclusion income with deductions after it has first applied its deductions against income that is not excess inclusion income in the case of any residual certificates held by a real estate investment trust the aggregate excess inclusions with respect to such residual certificates reduced but not below zero by the real estate investment trust taxable income within the meaning of code section b excluding any net capital gain will be allocated among the shareholders of such trust in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders from such trust and any amount so allocated will be treated as an excess inclusion with respect to a residual certificate as if held directly by such shareholder regulated investment companies common trust funds and certain cooperatives are subject to similar rules payments any distribution made on a residual certificate to a residual certificateholder will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent it does not exceed the residual certificateholders adjusted basis in such residual certificate to the extent a distribution exceeds such adjusted basis it will be treated as gain from the sale of the residual certificate sale or exchange of residual certificates if a residual certificate is sold or exchanged the seller will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and its adjusted basis in the residual certificate except that the recognition of loss may be limited under the wash sale rules described below a holders adjusted basis in a residual certificate generally equals the cost of such residual certificate to such residual

distributions received thereon by such residual certificateholder in general any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss provided the residual certificate is held as a capital asset however residual certificates will be evidences of indebtedness within the meaning of code section c so that gain or loss recognized from sale of a residual certificate by a bank or thrift institution to which such section applies would be ordinary income or loss except as provided in treasury regulations yet to be issued if the seller of a residual certificate reacquires such residual certificate or

the remics basis therein is less than or greater than its principal balance respectively any such discount whether market discount or original issue discount will be includable in the income of the remic as it accrues in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to such income under a method similar to the method described above for accruing original issue discount on the regular certificates the remic expects to elect under code section  to amortize any premium on the mortgage loans premium on any mortgage loan to which such election applies would be amortized under a constant yield method it is not clear whether the yield of a mortgage loan would be calculated for this purpose based on scheduled payments or taking account of the prepayment assumption additionally such an election would not apply to any mortgage loan originated on or before september   instead premium on such a mortgage loan would be allocated among the principal payments thereon and would be deductible by the remic as those payments become due the remic will be allowed a deduction for interest and original issue discount on the regular certificates the amount and method of accrual of original issue discount will be calculated for this purpose in the same manner as described above with respect to regular certificates except that the  per annum de minimis rule and adjustments for subsequent holders described therein will not apply a residual certificateholder will not be permitted to amortize the cost of the residual certificate as an offset to its share of the remics taxable

retirement income act of  as amended erisa and the code which apply only to certificates of a series that are not divided into subclasses if certificates are divided into subclasses the related prospectus supplement will contain information concerning considerations relating to erisa and the code that are applicable to such certificates erisa imposes requirements on employee benefit plans subject to erisa and on certain other retirement plans and arrangements including individual retirement accounts and annuities keogh plans and collective investment funds and separate accounts in which such plans accounts or arrangements are invested subject to the requirement of erisa andor the code collectively plans and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to such plans generally erisa applies to investments made by plans among other things erisa requires that the assets of plans be held in trust and that the trustee or other duly authorized fiduciary have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of such plans erisa also imposes certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of plans under erisa any person who exercises any authority or control respecting the management or disposition of the assets of a plan is considered to be a fiduciary of such plan subject to certain exceptions not here relevant certain employee benefit plans such as governmental plans as defined in erisa section  and if no election has been made under section d of the code church plans as defined in erisa section  are not subject to erisa requirements accordingly assets of such plans may be invested in senior certificates without regard to the erisa considerations described above and below subject to the provisions of applicable state law any such plan which is qualified and exempt from taxation under code sections a and a however is subject to the prohibited transaction rules set forth in code section  on november   the united states department of labor labor issued final regulations concerning the definition of what constitutes the assets of a plan labor reg section  under this regulation the underlying assets and properties of corporations partnerships and certain other entities in which a plan makes an equity investment could be deemed for purposes of erisa to be assets of the investing plan in certain circumstances however the regulation provides that generally the assets of a corporation or partnership in which a plan invests will not be deemed for purposes of erisa to be assets of such plan if the equity interest acquired by the investing plan is a publiclyoffered security a publiclyoffered  pbrd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd security as defined in the labor reg section  is a security that is widely held freely transferable and registered under the securities exchange act of  as amended in addition to the imposition of general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification erisa prohibits a broad range of transactions involving plan assets and persons parties in interest having certain specified relationships to a plan and imposes additional prohibitions where parties in interest are fiduciaries with respect to such plan because the mortgage loans may be deemed plan assets of each plan that purchases certificates an investment in the certificates by a plan might be a prohibited transaction under erisa sections  and  and subject to an excise tax under code section  unless a statutory or administrative exemption applies pte  in prohibited transaction exemption  pte  which amended prohibited transaction exemption  labor exempted from erisas prohibited transaction rules certain transactions relating to the operation of residential mortgage pool investment trusts and the purchase sale and holding of mortgage pool passthrough certificates in the initial issuance of such certificates pte  permits subject to certain conditions transactions that might otherwise be prohibited between plans and parties in interest with respect to those plans related to the origination maintenance and termination of mortgage pools consisting of mortgage loans secured by first or second mortgages or deeds of trust on singlefamily residential property and the acquisition and holding of certain mortgage pool passthrough certificates representing an interest in such mortgage pools by plans if the general conditions discussed below of pte  are satisfied investments by a plan in certificates that represent interests in a mortgage pool consisting of mortgage loans representing loans for single family homes single family certificates will be exempt from the prohibitions of erisa sections a and  relating generally to transactions with parties in interest who are not fiduciaries if the plan purchases the single family certificates at no more than fair market value and will be exempt from the prohibitions of erisa sections b and  relating generally to transactions with fiduciaries if in addition the purchase is approved by an independent fiduciary no sales commission is paid to the pool sponsor the plan does not purchase more than  of all single family certificates and at least  of all single family certificates are purchased by persons independent of the pool sponsor or pool trustee pte  does not provide an exemption for transactions involving subordinate certificates accordingly unless otherwise provided in the related prospectus supplement no transfer of a subordinate certificate may be made to a plan the discussion in this and the next succeeding paragraph applies only to single family certificates the depositor believes that for purposes of pte  the term mortgage passthrough certificate would include i certificates issued in a series consisting of only a single class of certificates and ii offered certificates issued in a series in which there is only one class of offered certificates provided that the certificates in the case of clause i or the offered certificates in the case of clause ii evidence the beneficial ownership of both a specified percentage of future interest payments greater than  and a specified percentage greater than  of future principal payments on the mortgage loans it is not clear whether a class of certificates that evidences the beneficial ownership in a trust fund divided into mortgage loan groups beneficial ownership of a specified percentage of interest payments only or principal payments only or a notional amount of either principal or interest payments or a class of certificates entitled to receive payments of interest and principal on the mortgage loans only after payments to other classes or after the occurrence of certain specified events would be a mortgage passthrough certificate for purposes of pte  pte  sets forth three general conditions which must be satisfied for any transaction to be eligible for exemption i the maintenance of a system of insurance or other protection for the pooled mortgage loans and property securing such loans and for indemnifying certificateholders against reductions in passthrough payments due to property damage or defaults in loan payments in an amount not less than the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal balance of all covered pooled mortgage loans or the principal balance of the largest covered pooled mortgage loan ii the existence of a pool trustee who is not an affiliate of the pool sponsor and iii a limitation on the amount of the payment retained by the pool sponsor together with other  pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th funds inuring to its benefit to not more than adequate consideration for selling the mortgage loans plus reasonable compensation for services provided by the pool sponsor to the mortgage pool the depositor believes that the first general condition referred to above will be satisfied with respect to the certificates in a series issued without a subordination feature or the senior certificates only in a series issued with a subordination feature provided that the subordination and reserve fund subordination by shifting of interests the pool insurance or other form of credit enhancement described herein such subordination pool insurance or other form of credit enhancement being the system of insurance or other protection referred to above with respect to a series of certificates is maintained in an amount not less than the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans or the principal balance of the largest mortgage loan see description of the certificates herein in the absence of a ruling that the system of insurance or other protection with respect to a series of certificates satisfies the first general condition referred to above there can be no assurance that these features will be so viewed by labor the trustee will not be affiliated with the depositor each plan fiduciary who is responsible for making the investment decisions whether to purchase or commit to purchase and to hold single family certificates must make its own determination as to whether the first and third general conditions and the specific conditions described briefly in the preceding paragraph of pte  have been satisfied or as to the availability of any other prohibited transaction exemptions each plan fiduciary should also determine whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification an investment in the certificates is appropriate for the plan taking into account the overall investment policy of the plan and the composition of the plans investment portfolio underwriter exemptions labor has issued to various underwriters substantially similar individual exemptions each an underwriter exemption and collectively the underwriter exemptions which apply to certain sales and servicing of certificates that are obligations of a trust with respect to which such underwriters are the underwriter manager or comanager of an underwriting syndicate the underwriter exemptions provide relief which is generally similar to that provided by pte  but is broader in several respects the underwriter exemptions contain several requirements some of which differ from those in pte  the underwriter exemptions contain an expanded definition of certificate which includes an interest which entitles the holder to passthrough payments of principal interest andor other payments the underwriter exemptions contain an expanded definition of trust which permits the trust corpus to consist of secured consumer receivables including obligations secured by shares issued by a cooperative housing association the definition of trust however does not include private mortgagebacked securities like the private mortgagebacked securities and does not include any other investment pool unless inter alia i the investment pool consists only of assets of the type which have been included in other investment pools ii certificates evidencing interests in such other investment pools have been purchased by investors other than plans for at least one year prior to the plans acquisition of certificates pursuant to the underwriter exemptions and iii certificates in such other investment pools have been rated in one of the three highest generic rating categories of the four credit rating agencies noted below generally the underwriter exemptions hold that the acquisition of certificates by a plan must be on terms including the price for the certificates that are at least as favorable to the plan as they would be in an armslength transaction with an unrelated party the underwriter exemptions require that the rights and interests evidenced by the certificates held by a plan not be subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced by other certificates of the same trust further the underwriter exemptions require that certificates acquired by a plan have received a rating at the time of their acquisition that is in one of the three highest generic rating categories of standard and poors ratings services moodys investors service inc duff  phelps inc or fitch investors service inc the underwriter exemptions also specify that the pool trustee must not be an affiliate of the pool sponsor nor an affiliate of the underwriter the pool servicer any obligor with respect to mortgage loans included in the trust constituting more than five percent of the aggregate unamortized principal balance of the assets in the trust or any affiliate of such entities

following month payment will then be made by the respective depositary of the dtc participants account against delivery of the global securities after settlement has been completed the global securities will be credited to the respective clearing system and by the clearing system in accordance with its usual procedures to the cedel participants or euroclear participants account the securities credit will appear the next day european time and the cash debt will be backvalued to and the interest on the global securities will accrue from the value date which would be the preceding day when settlement occurred in new york if settlement is not completed on the intended value date ie the trade fails the cedel or euroclear cash debt will be valued instead as of the actual settlement date cedel participants and euroclear participants will need to make available to the respective clearing systems the funds necessary to process sameday funds settlement the most direct means of doing so is to preposition funds for settlement either from cash on hand or existing lines of credit as they would for any settlement occurring within cedel or euroclear under this approach they may take on credit exposure to cedel or euroclear until the global securities are credited to their accounts one day later as an alternative if cedel or euroclear has extended a line of credit to them cedel participants or euroclear participants can elect not to preposition funds and allow that credit line to be drawn upon the finance settlement under this procedure cedel participants or euroclear participants purchasing global securities would incur overdraft charges for one day assuming they cleared the overdraft when the global securities were credited to their accounts however interest on the global securities would accrue from the value date therefore in many cases the investment income on the global securities earned during that oneday period may substantially reduce or offset the amount of such overdraft charges although this result will depend on each cedel participants or euroclear participants particular cost of funds since the settlement is taking place during new york business hours dtc participants can employ their usual procedures for sending global securities to the respective european depositary for the benefit of cedel participants or euroclear participants the sale proceeds will be available to the dtc seller on the settlement date thus to the dtc participants a crossmarket transaction will settle no differently than a trade between two dtc participants trading between cedel or euroclear seller and dtc purchaser due to time zone differences in their favor cedel participants and euroclear participants may employ their customary procedures for transactions in which global securities are to be transferred by the respective clearing system through the respective depositary to a dtc participant the seller will send instructions to cedel or euroclear through a cedel participant or euroclear participant at least one business day prior to settlement in these cases cedel or euroclear will instruct the respective depositary as appropriate to deliver the global securities to the dtc participants account against payment payment will include interest accrued on the global securities from and including the last coupon payment to and excluding the settlement date on the basis of the actual number of days in such accrual period and a year assumed to consist of  days for transactions settling on the st of the month payment will include interest accrued to and excluding the first day of the following month the payment will then be reflected in the account of the cedel participant or euroclear participant the following day and receipt of the cash proceeds in the cedel participants or euroclear participants account will be backvalued to the value date which would be the preceding day when settlement occurred in new york should the cedel participant or euroclear participant have a line of credit with its respective clearing system and elect to be in debt in anticipation of receipt of the sale proceeds in its account the backvaluation will extinguish any overdraft incurred over that oneday period if settlement is not completed on the ii pbth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th intended value date ie the trade fails receipt of the cash proceeds in the cedel participants or euroclear participants account would instead be valued as of the actual settlement date finally day traders that use cedel or euroclear and that purchase global securities from dtc participants for delivery to cedel participants or euroclear participants should note that these trades would automatically fail on the sale side unless affirmative action were taken at least three techniques should be readily available to eliminate this potential problem a borrowing through cedel or euroclear for one day until the purchase side of the day trade is reflected in their cedel or euroclear accounts in accordance with the clearing systems customary procedures b borrowing the global securities in the us from a dtc participant no later than one day prior to settlement which would give the global securities sufficient time to be reflected in their cedel or euroclear account in order to settle the sale side of the trade or c staggering the value dates for the buy and sell sides of the trade so that the value date for the purchase from the dtc participant is at least one day prior to the value date for the sale to the
