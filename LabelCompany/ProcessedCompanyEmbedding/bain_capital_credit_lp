in  by bain  company partners mitt romney t coleman andrews iii and eric kriss after bill bain had offered romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn

company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by

individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its

made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the

offered romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the fastgrowing retail chain went public in  by  the company had grown to over  stores and as of fiscal year end january  staples reached over  billion in sales nearly b in net income  employees and

group which ended up returning a fold gain bain invested the  million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by  was generating an annualized return in excess of  percent by the end of the decade bains second fund raised in  had deployed  million into  investments as the firm began organizing around funds each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by the end of  bain had raised  million of capital and financed  companies with combined

included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in

bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the

head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the fastgrowing retail chain went public in  by  the company had grown to over  stores and as of fiscal year end january  staples reached over  billion in sales nearly b in net income  employees and  stores bain capital eventually

a fold gain bain invested the  million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by  was generating an annualized return in excess of  percent by the end of the decade bains second fund raised in  had deployed  million into  investments as the firm began organizing around funds each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by the end of  bain had raised  million of capital and financed  companies with combined revenues of  billion in july  bain

political legacyedit romney took a paid leave of absence from bain capital in february  when he became the head of the salt lake organizing committee for the  winter olympics the decision caused turmoil at bain capital with a power struggle ensuing some partners left and founded the audax group and golden gate capital other partners threatened to leave and there was a prospect of eightfigure lawsuits being filed romney was worried that the firm might be destroyed but the crisis ebbed romney was not involved in daytoday operations of the firm after starting the olympics position those were handled by a management committee consisting of five of the fourteen remaining active partners with the firm however according to some interviews and press releases during  romney said he was keeping a parttime function at bain during his leave of absence romney continued to be listed in filings to the us securities and exchange commission as sole shareholder sole director chief executive officer and president the sec filings reflected the legal reality and the ownership interest in the bain capital management company in practice former bain partners have stated that romneys attention was mostly occupied by his olympics position he did stay in regular contact with his partners and traveled to meet with them several times signing corporate and legal documents and paying attention to his own interests within the firm and to his departure negotiations bain capital fund vi in  was the last one romney was involved in investors were worried that with romney gone the firm would have trouble raising money for bain capital fund vii in  but in practice the  billion was raised without much trouble his former partners have said that romney had no role in assessing other new investments after february  nor was he involved in directing the company’s investment funds discussions over the final terms of romneys departure dragged on during this time with romney negotiating for the best deal he could get and his continuing position as ceo and sole shareholder giving him the leverage to do so although he had left open the possibility of returning to bain after the olympics romney made his crossover to politics in  his separation from the firm was finalized in early  romney negotiated a tenyear retirement agreement with bain capital that allowed him to receive a passive profit share and interest as a retired partner in some bain capital entities including buyout and bain capital investment funds in exchange for his ownership in the management company because the private equity business continued to thrive this deal would bring him millions of dollars in annual income romney was the first and last ceo of bain capital since his departure became final it has continued to be run by management committee bain capital itself and especially its actions and investments during its first  years came under press scrutiny as the result of romneys  and  presidential campaigns romneys leave of absence and the level of activity he had within the firm during the  period also garnered attention early sedit in  bain acquired burger king together with tpg capital and goldman sachs capital partners in  dic entertainment chairman and ceo andy heyward partnered with bain capital inc in a management buyout of dic from the walt disney co heyward continued as chairman

the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket

partnership—that included all bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by the end of  bain had raised  million of capital and financed

america how private equity is destroying jobs and killing the american economy josh kosman described bain capital as notorious for its failure to plow profits back into its businesses being the first large privateequity firm to derive a large fraction of its revenues from corporate dividends and other distributions the revenue potential of this strategy which may starve a company of capital was

dividends in at least some instances companies acquired by bain borrowed money in order to increase their dividend payments ultimately leading to the collapse of what had been financially stable

historyedit  founding and early historyedit bain capital was founded in  by bain  company partners mitt romney t coleman andrews iii and eric kriss after bill bain had offered romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply bains consulting techniques to improve operations in addition to the three founding partners the early team included fraser bullock robert f white joshua bekenstein adam kirsch and geoffrey s rehnert romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner or managing partner he later became referred to as managing director or ceo as well he was also the sole shareholder of the firm at the beginning the firm had fewer than ten employees in the face of skepticism from potential investors romney and his partners spent a year raising the  million in funds needed to start the new operation bain partners put in  million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals early investors included boston real estate mogul mortimer zuckerman and robert kraft the owner of the new england patriots football team they also included members of elite salvadoran families who fled the countrys civil war they and other wealthy latin americans invested  million primarily through offshore companies registered in panama while bain capital was founded by bain executives the firm was not an affiliate or a division of bain  company but rather a completely separate company initially the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower at copley place in boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations however the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the bain  company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest bain capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of bain  company the firm initially gave a cut of its profits to bain  company but romney later persuaded bill bain to give that up bain capital was an initial investor in staples inc the bain capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital by  things were going poorly enough that romney considered closing the operation returning investors money back to them and having the partners go back to their old positions the partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by  very few had been done at first bain capital focused on venture capital opportunities one of bains earliest and most notable venture investments was in staples inc the office supply retailer in  bain provided  million to two supermarket executives leo kahn and thomas g stemberg to open an office supply supermarket in brighton massachusetts the fastgrowing retail chain went public in  by  the company had grown to over  stores and as of fiscal year end january  staples reached over  billion in sales nearly b in net income  employees and  stores bain capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment and romney sat on the staples board of directors for over a decade another very successful investment occurred in  when  million was invested in medical equipment maker calumet coach which eventually returned  million a few years later bain capital made an investment in the technology research outfit the gartner group which ended up returning a fold gain bain invested the  million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by  was generating an annualized return in excess of  percent by the end of the decade bains second fund raised in  had deployed  million into  investments as the firm began organizing around funds each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all bain capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by bain capital inc the management company that romney had full ownership control of as ceo romney had a final say in every deal made sedit beginning in  the firm which began as a venture capital source investing in startup companies adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets partner with existing management to apply bain methodology to their operations rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios and sell them off in a few years existing ceos were offered large equity stakes in the process owing to bain capitals belief in the emerging agency theory that ceos should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals by the end of  bain had raised  million of capital and financed  companies with combined revenues of  billion in july  bain

them another study that looked at the eightyear period following  deals during the same time found that in  cases the company went bankrupt or out of business and in  cases bain capital lost all its investment but  deals were very successful and represented  percent of the total profits romney had two diversions from bain capital during the first half of the decade from january  to december  romney served as the ceo of bain  company where he led the successful turnaround of the consulting firm he remained managing general partner of bain capital during this time in november  he took a leave of absence for his unsuccessful  run for the us senate seat from massachusetts he returned the day after the election in november  during that time ampad workers went on strike and asked romney

political legacyedit romney took a paid leave of absence from bain capital in february  when he became the head of the salt lake organizing committee for the  winter olympics the decision caused turmoil at bain capital with a power struggle ensuing some partners left and founded the audax group and golden gate capital other partners threatened to leave and there was a prospect of eightfigure lawsuits being filed romney was worried that the firm might be destroyed but the crisis ebbed romney was not involved in daytoday operations of the firm after starting the olympics position those were handled by a management committee consisting of five of the fourteen remaining active partners with the firm however according to some interviews and press releases during  romney said he was keeping a parttime function at bain during his leave of absence romney continued to be listed in filings to the us securities and exchange commission as sole shareholder sole director chief executive officer and president the sec filings reflected the legal reality and the ownership interest in the bain capital management company in practice former bain partners have stated that romneys attention was mostly occupied by his olympics position he did stay in regular contact with his partners and traveled to meet with them several times signing corporate and legal documents and paying attention to his own interests within the firm and to his departure negotiations bain capital fund vi in  was the last one romney was involved in investors were worried that with romney gone the firm would have trouble raising money for bain capital fund vii in  but in practice the  billion was raised without much trouble his former partners have said that romney had no role in assessing other new investments after february  nor was he involved in directing the company’s investment funds discussions over the final terms of romneys departure dragged on during this time with romney negotiating for the best deal he could get and his continuing position as ceo and sole shareholder giving him the leverage to do so although he had left open the possibility of returning to bain after the olympics romney made his crossover to politics in  his separation from the firm was finalized in early  romney negotiated a tenyear retirement agreement with bain capital that allowed him to receive a passive profit share and interest as a retired partner in some bain capital entities including buyout and bain capital investment funds in exchange for his ownership in the management company because
