photography – part  lighting  background following up on last week’s post product photography part  – cameras today we’re taking a closer look at the lighting and background setup needed to get those perfect product pictures in my opinion this is actually the most important post in this product photography series and it’s something most sellers completely overlook but with just a little education on the subject you’ll be able to create a mini photo studio that helps you create stunning product pictures so without further ado let’s get started backgrounds to create beautiful product pictures you need to use some sort of background why well to get rid of distractions and background ‘noise’ and allow your product to be the only feature of your pictures okay if you’re selling something like a car you won’t need to put it on a white background lol but in most cases you’ll want to use it – be it for small medium or large products if you take a look on ebay you’ll find plenty of amateurish looking pictures of products on wrinkled bed sheets and while this may be okay if you’re just selling some unwanted items from around your house business sellers should really take more care in how they present their products and the key to this is a good background set up the first thing that comes to most people’s minds are so called lightboxes – you can get them on ebay and online shops in various sizes and settings – with the cheapest starting at just £ or so and the most expensive supersized versions costing several hundred pounds lightbox from tabletopstudiocom here’s the thing – you don’t need them that’s right you don’t need to purchase a lightbox to take outstanding product pictures i’d actually recommend you stay away from them as they will only complicate your life seriously theoretically they work ok but only if you have very powerful lights to get the box well exposed and even then i can’t see any reason why you would want to use a lightbox at all i have purchased several of them in the past and after some trial and error haven’t touched them have you ever seen any professional photo studio that uses lightboxes i haven’t either and there must be a reason why professionals don’t use them – they’re more harm than good with the wrinkles and shadows they create to create a seamless background for your product photography setup all you need is a large sheet of paper or fabric that’s it in most cases paper will work best as it has no wrinkles and is very cheap to buy  you can get any colour you want fabric can also be used but only if you want to create some sort of special effect like a textured background for small to medium sized items simply get as big a sheet of white paper as you can find most craft shops carry these in sizes up to a  cm x  cm and if you’re lucky you can even find a or a sheets which are gigantic but for most people a is all you really need and here’s what you need to do to create a quick studio setup – use a chair table surface with something behind it books dvds boxes – whatever so you can lay down half of the sheet on the surface and align the other half vertically to create a seamless transition from front to back secure the top side of the paper with paper clips or clamps it should look something like this background setup for small items there are special stands you can purchase online if you want but seriously you don’t need them if you put this little setup together from stuff that’s already in your house then you keep the cost down and most importantly can then customise your setup whenever it’s required that’s all there is to it really – this may look too simple to work well but trust me you don’t need anything more to take superb product images for your ebay or ecommerce shop the key elements are a pure white background no hard cornersedges and a seamless transition behind the item sample image taken with this small setup  for larger and bulkier items when a size paper is too small you will want to buy a larger paper roll this is the same thing used by professional photographers in their studios and can be freely purchased online expect to pay ££ for a roll that will last you decades various sizes and colours are available from online shops like photographybackgroundscouk and many others you’ll also find stand systems there which will make your life much easier when handling such large backgrounds or just search for them on ebay as prices will be cheaper if you can’t afford to buy a stand simply create one yourself all you really need is some way to attach the paper to your ceiling and then you can simply roll it out onto the floor to create that curved angle expandable curtain bars can be used for this as showed in this guide there are also vinyl and fabric rolls available but they will be more expensive and suitable more for people photography rather than products and again you don’t really need them unless you want to create a specific effect colour wise the rules are pretty simple for white goods and see through goods like glass  crystal use a black background for everything else – pure white this is a setup you can’t go wrong with obviously you’re not obligated to stick with this and if you really feel that you must use pink instead of a white background use it just be careful not to overdo it white still works best in  of cases so maybe it’s best to stick with what works in some niches though you may want to experiment a little bit to create a unique look for your images this can be especially worthwhile on ebay – for gallery images since no text and graphics are allowed in gallery images the background is something you can use to stand out from the crowd for example you sell widget x with  competing listings – all using a white background you could use a different colourmaterial background to make your pictures stand out in the search results but be careful – you definitely don’t want your item to get lost in the background – the product should still be clearly visible and the focus of your pictures here are some alternate background materials you can use  wood  glass  tile  fabric wood is perfect for emphasising the organicnatural feature of a product this could be organic food like in the example below or handmade jewellery tiles are perfect for creating an interesting reflection effect for example black glossshiny tiles are perfect for jewellery watches and other metallic products as it will create a reflection in the images all you need to achieve this is one large floor tile with a gloss finish an even more interesting effect can be achieved with stone materials or gloss tiles with stone designs these would be perfect for bathroom accessories and similar products so while white and black paper is your number one choice using other materials and colours can be great way to create unique product images that will stand out in ebay’s search results as well as feature your item in the environment which suits it best lighting so that’s the camera and background sorted what else is needed to create stunning product pictures light the more you can get the better up to a certain degree lighting is that one thing most newbie sellers don’t pay attention to at all and it’s the reason their product pictures turn out dull blurry and with lots of shadows not anymore by following this guide you’ll be able to setup your home studio in the same way professionals do just without the high price tag you’ll need to invest some money though as unless you’re ready to go for the free option taking pictures outside which we’ll cover later without buying some sort of equipment it will be very hard to achieve decent results most cameras come with a built in flash the bad news however is that they are not suitable for product photography at all particularly with smaller items built in flash systems simply don’t deliver as much light as you need in product photography  it distributes light unevenly creating shadows around your item – which is something you definitely want to avoid so what options are there that depends on your budget really so i’ll cover several solutions  flashstrobe kit ££ this is the best option if you can afford it these are similar systems to ones used by professional photographers obviously they use more expensive and more powerful branded kits but for product photography even these cheaper china made sets are perfectly fine the way these flash kits work is that you attach a receiver to your cameras flash mount shoe and it will “communicate” with all strobes simultaneously and fire them when needed this setup will only work if you have a dslr camera though as compact cameras usually don’t have hot shoe connectors for external flash units and even if they do some models chances are they won’t be able to communicate with such a complex setup the best place to buy such a kit is on ebay – you can get starter packs for as cheap as £ and more advanced kits for around £ what to look for in such a kit  how powerful is the flash output in watts the more the better really… w per flash head is ideal don’t worry – there’s no such thing as too much as these flash heads have variable power adjustment which lets you manually adjust the output power for close up pictures for example  how many flash heads there are in the kit you’ll need  right left and top  soft boxesumbrellas these help distribute the light evenly so are a must have accessory i like umbrellas more than soft boxes as they tend to give more light  stands ideally stands for the flash heads and soft boxesumbrellas should be included so you don’t have to buy them separately perfect kit for product photography click here for this ebay listing so this would be the perfect setup for any online seller this is a onetime investment in your business so think twice before opting for a cheaper alternative obviously for some people even £ is too much to spend on a lighting kit right now so what to do  use regular lighting fixtures with powerful daylight bulbs it can be a desk lamp or a clampon lamp – either will work just fine the bigger the reflective area of the lamp and the more powerful the bulb the better with bulbs be careful though – you need the “daylight” type of bulbs that produce k white light if you use traditional bulbs they’ll produce a yellowish colour light and many led bulbs will produce a slightly blueish tint just tell the sales person that you need daylight bulbs as powerful as you can get just read the label and make sure your fixtures can accommodate what you’re buying if you’re buying these online most sites will have the colour temperature in the product descriptions in total you’ll need  units – right left and top you’ll also need to figure out how to position them properly – so a cheap tripod or other stand is a must have we’ll talk more about positioning of lights in next week’s article if you shop smart you should be able to get all this done for less than  quid maybe even  quid if you already have some light fixtures you can use for this purpose it can’t get any cheaper right wrong there’s one more totally free option to explore…  the sun yep the last option would be to simply take your product pictures outside and use natural lighting you don’t even need a sunny day for this plenty of them in the uk right – as even on cloudy days there’s usually enough light outside to take good pictures and with a little editing you can get pretty decent results this way the downside to this is that you obviously have no control over your setup – if it rains you can’t take pictures i also wouldn’t want to do this in winter… but for some people this may work especially if you live somewhere else other than the uk you can actually use natural daylight without leaving your house what you do is simply position your photo studio nearby a window so that you get plenty of light from it this will work best on sunny days when it’s bright outside but unfortunately on cloudy days you just won’t get enough light coming into your room we’ll talk about this more in the editing lesson part  of this series but for now just so you know you don’t have to get your images looking perfect on your camera lots of things can be adjusted afterwards using photo editing software for example your lighting setup may create a slightly greyish look – that’s not a problem as in most cases that can be adjusted afterwards using levels and white balance functions whatever you do get lighting right as it will then be super easy to get good pictures even with cheaper cameras possibly even smartphones a good lighting setup means that the item is evenly lit with no shadows around it hence why we use three light units – right side left side and top as it will be difficult to remove shadows later on next week we’ll take a closer look at the actual product photography process how to allocate lighting units what settings to use how to handle your camera and much more thanks andrew leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name

using the same background technique as you describe with the white card i”m just using  desk lamps to light the subjects and have found some white k bulbs on ebay of various wattages could you advise of a suitable wattage for this type of work please reply andrew minalto says february   at  am hi ted the more the better you can always move lights further away from the object but i would say some  watt kit will be enough w each bulb – right left top thanks andrew reply paul bisiker says january   at  am hi andrew ive been given your blog from a fellow ebay  say your the best  to give me some advice 🙂 i sell clothing on ebay which are usually on a dummy or coat hanger heres my link to my ebay store httpwwwebaycoukschbritishemporiumclothingmhtmlitemhashitemabcertnctrksidpl ive just converted my xft garden shed into a photo roomive put white board all inside the framework  put a white lino on the floornow i need to know which lights to buy to lighten the room up  would it be better to get tube lighting or rounded spotlights as the ceiling is “v” shaped ive also got  softboxes is it best to have these furthest from the dummy at an angle in front facing the dummy as the shed is only ft wide and if i pit at each side on the dummy they look to close to it ive also got a canon d dlsr with basic lens as i was told this was sufficent i hope you can help as ive been trying to sort my pictures out for  years regards paul reply andrew minalto says february   at  am hi paul whatever lights work best for you as long as they’re “daylight” spec lamps yes you can use soft boxes that way but ideally you would have two moresmall ones you can use close to item on both sides to eliminate any shadowing andrew reply sunita shrestha says january   at  am thanks andrew for sharing all this its great to know has add value to my to be start business i will take all of the information in account reply andrew minalto says january   at  am you’re welcome sunita 🙂 reply chris says october   at  pm dear andrew thanks for all the above info – is plotter paper white paper gr suitable for product photography – is seamless paper different thanks in advance chris reply andrew minalto says october   at  am hi chris yes r paper should be fine as long as it’s pure white yes seamless paper would be better as it has nonreflective surface thanks andrew reply gerald zuckerwar says january   at  pm i finally figured out how to make the background of my product pictures pure white first it helps but is not required to set the white balance of your camera it really doesn’t matter what lighting you use i use about  cfl bulbs and over expose my shots by two steps so take a picture of a pure white background and set that as your white color then affter you take your picture analyze the actual color of your white background using the free and excellent colorcop software with this tool you you can place an eyedropper anywhere on the image and it will give you the exact rgb values pure white is  next open the image up with the free and excellent faststone image viewer this software has an “adjust colors” function move the cursor to the left of the screen for a popup menu simply increase each of the rgb values to get  for example if your rgb was  you would add  to red  to green and  to blue then save your image with the new adjustments your background will now be pure white reply andrew minalto says january   at  am thanks for sharing this gerald excellent tips andrew reply tim says december   at  am hello andrew first of all thanks for sharing this valuable information i’ve looked for a while for a detailed guide on how to take professional looking product pictures and you’ve done an amazing job  i started with a lightbox kit sold on amazon and quickly realized that the × watts lamps provided with the kit was a joke i bought  new lamps of × watts k but it still feels like it’s not enough  i’m shooting sunglasses and it’s a nightmare to shoot black models… never enough light so i ended up putting my × watts inside the box  after reading this post i’m seriously considering ditching that damn lightbox as you suggest 😉 i’m using a dslr nikon d with the original lens for a while i thought the issue might be with the lens… that maybe i needed a macro but the cost is just ridiculous… do you think it’s really necessary i’m considering going with strobes now and getting rid of that box… would you advise also getting these shooting tables or are they unnecessary anyways thanks again for the valuable and actionable information you are sharing on your website i wish i read you post sooner looking forward to your advise regards tim reply andrew minalto says december   at  am hi tim no your standard lens is not the problem lack of light is so you should get much better results with strobes and no – you don’t need a shooting table – just use a large piece of white paper just like in my example as a background and get decent lights thanks andrew reply oren says september   at  pm hello first of all thank you for sharing your knowledge … my name is oren and i am a seller in the jewelry field at the moment i takephotos of my products through the iphone without any accompanying accessories in order to improve the images i want to buy a better light accessories but i feel confused all the products that field i would love guidance for photography products that fits for shooting jewelry as well as your mind about the following product httpwwwebaycomitmprofessionalportableminiphotostudioboxphotographybackdropbuiltinlightptlhdefaultdomainhashitemcfbhtwt thank you reply andrew minalto says september   at  pm hi oren take a look  this company httpwwwtabletopstudiocomjewelryphotographyhtml they have various productsaccessories for jewellery photography as well as very detailed guides thanks andrew reply oren says september   at  pm thanks reply daniel reynolds says june   at  am i have found florescent bulbs k are the ones i am using are a little easier than strobes i had initially tested with strobes however had a hard time getting my camera settings right for shooting with the strobes through trial and error with my continuous florescent bulbs i was able to dial in the correct camera settings another thing your users might find useful that really helped me was a photography software by a company called iconasys that allow me to shoot my images through a computer it has been especially beneficial to my process time allowing me to increase my product photography throughput im shooting about  products a day for my ebay store reply andrew minalto says june   at  am thanks for your comment daniel i did try the soft that came with the camera – camera control pro to take pics using a pc it was ok but since i purchased the remote control i just started using it and it’s still quite convenient thanks andrew reply lianne says may   at  pm hi andrew thanks so much for your posts on product photography i have found them very useful i just have a question regarding lighting i am using regular lamps and before reading your article i was looking to purchase some k daylight bulbs that i found online but you mentioned to use bulbs that produce k white light please can you advise if k daylight bulbs would also be ok many thanks lianne reply andrew minalto says may   at  pm hi lianne k daylight bulbs should be ok too yes just make sure you set custom white balance in your camera before you take the shots but if you buy brand new bulbs better go for k thanks andrew reply lianne says may   at  pm hi andrew thanks for the fast response for now i am actually using the camera on my iphone s and the results haven’t been too bad even with the non daylight bulbs i have been using but this means i can’t adjust the white balance i will see how i get on with the daylight bulbs but after reading your articles i am toying with the idea of trying out one of the dslr cameras you mentioned as they look more affordable than i had expected im just unsure if the lenses they come with would be suitable for my product needs or if i’d end up needing a different more expensive one thanks again lianne reply andrew minalto says may   at  pm what kind of products you’re selling smallbig what material reply lianne says may   at  pm i sell wedding related products so table  venue decorations  other accessories  gifts also party accessories  decorations such as paper plates place cards  bunting to be honest most of my suppliers provide images which i am happy to use in most instances but a handful of their images are not good enough so i would like to take my own plus one supplier doesn’t provide images at all which means as yet i have been unable to stock their products their products are mainly small i would say ranging from cm to around cm they are vintage style products made from a variety of materials such as painted wood fabric ribbon card and porcelain with other materials such as string or metal wire for hanging on some of them andrew minalto says may   at  pm for products like these a macro lens really works best so if you buy a new dslr buy body only and purchase a separate macro or telezoom with macro function lens thanks andrew lianne says may   at  pm ok great thanks again for the advice it’s much appreciated 🙂 andrew minalto says may   at  am you’re welcome lianne judy says february   at  pm i read your post if my product is pretty large would it work if i taped two rolls of construction paper together to expand the width or would that create an unseamless paper does my white background material or paper have to be one complete piece by itself or can i tape things together reply andrew minalto says february   at  am hi judy you can try doing that but i would simply recommend you getting one roll of special background paper like this one httpwwwphotographybackgroundscoukphotographybackgroundpapershtml problem solved 🙂 thanks andrew reply james bradley says october   at  pm great post andrew i’d love to have a chat with you about
