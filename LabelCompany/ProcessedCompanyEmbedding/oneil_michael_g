kasowitz drink too much”  world of difference between the two the short answer is i have no clue  i don’t know the man  i haven’t even heard any gossip or rumors from people who do  but    let me go out on a limb here  if you are trying to convince people that nationally publicized reports of a drinking problem are false it is probably not a good idea to send profanity laced emails to a complete stranger late at night telling him to “watch your back bitch”   posted in law news  leave a comment another bill o’donnell moment posted on april   by michael bill o’donnell was the terror of my grade school or at least from grades one through three  he disappeared after that  i don’t know what became of him  i suspect he was sent to some kind of juvenile facility bill o’donnell would misbehave for no reason at all just as a matter of principle  his brazenness was breathtaking  it seems that he would say anything or do anything so long as it was something he was not supposed to do or say  on a near daily basis some nun would take bill into the cloakroom and whack his knuckles with a ruler  more than one ruler was broken across his hands which must have been made of steel  bill would laugh it off and go on misbehaving a cost of doing business  i call that a bill o’donnell moment that was back in the early ’s  fast forward to the present time  a sociopathic corporation is that a redundancy named wells fargo got caught doing something naughty namely opening  million bank and credit card accounts in the names of individuals who never asked for those accounts to be opened  for this indiscretion wells fargo was fined  million  that’s all of  per unauthorized account can you imagine  i’ve seen  year employees fired for much less  the case comes to mind of a long time bank manager who was fired for using the bank’s federal express account once or twice of personal purposes like that never happens in corporate america right  the real reason she was fired was because somebody wanted to get rid of her for illegal reasons  fortunately we were able to settle that case and avoid the risk of dismissal  the bank pretended that integrity was the most critical attribute expected of bank managers  except when it comes to duping its own customers apparently  note  my client was not given the opportunity of paying  per transgression and moving on but that’s not what this post is about  it’s just that there’s just so much hypocrisy in this whole wells fargo story that i can barely contain myself  i tend to get sidetracked it has been widely reported that wells fargo is “clawing back”  million from the two wayward executives most responsible for the bank’s aberrant behavior  for those of you naive enough to believe that this somehow foreshadows an era of executive responsibility for corporate crimes think again  first of all neither of the two executives in question former ceo john stumpf and former director of community banking whatever that means carrie tolstedt have to dig into their own pockets  there are no claws in the “clawback”  all that is happening is that the bank is not letting stumpf and tolstedt cash in on certain stock options for   in other words this is  million that they never received  they are not paying back a dime  they are laughing all the way to the bank or in their case from the bank bill o’donnell would be proud a couple of facts that i learned in connection with this story blew my mind  from  through  stumpf was paid  million  that’s about  million a year  tolstedt was paid  million last year and she was due to receive  million when she retired these are fortunes  i am not using the word in the hyperbolic or figurative sense  these sums are literally fortunes such that their heirs will lives of luxury for generations to come without having to lift a finger   but isn’t that what capitalism and the free market is all about  no  these people were employees  they never had a dime of their own money at risk and they didn’t build a business or discover the cure for cancer  but wells fargo wouldn’t pay them so much if they weren’t worth it right  wrong  they run but do not own wells fargo so they basically set their own salaries  what we are seeing here is organized thievery  whose money is being stolen  if you are covered by a pension plan have a k or own shares in a mutual or exchange traded fund yours and mine chances are pretty good that some portion of your money is invested in wells fargo there is something seriously wrong with our system  i have no problem with executives being well compensated even to the point where they would be considered wealthy or modestly rich if there is such a thing  the rules of society should be such that it’s hard and a relatively rare occurrence for a person to accumulate a fortune  it should be a reward for doing something remarkable and beneficial to society not bilking two million of your employer’s customers posted in business economics news society  comments off somebody help me out with this posted on april   by michael a few days ago the trump administration says and i’m paraphrasing “assad is here to stay deal with it”  a few days later assad drops some poison gas bombs on a village and kills  citizens or so  trump launches  tomahawk missiles on a syrian air base the part i don’t get is this assad already had “gasses citizens” on his resume when trump accepted him into the fold of recognized heads of state  so whence the indignation when assad does what assad has done before  to me it’s like this your wife asks you to invite your brother harry over for thanksgiving dinner  you remind your wife that harry has atrocious table manners and that she has said he is not fit to sit at anybody’s dinner table even at a soup kitchen  “but he’s your brother” she says “and i’m just going to accept that fact”  but when harry lets out a monster belch between courses your wife has a fit and throws her wine glass at harry so much for dealing with it mind you i’m not saying it’s a good thing or a bad thing to accept the “political reality” of assad  the man is clearly a monster of the first order  but what is knocking out one airbase going to accomplish  back in first grade there was a kid named o’donnell who was as much of a juvenile delinquent as a first grader could possibly be  the nuns used to rap o’donnell’s knuckles with a ruler when he misbehaved which was all the time  he would laugh it off  assad must be laughing now  russia will give him more planes destroying the airbase is like kicking the saddle because the mule won’t move  those six people whoever they were that were killed when the airbase was bombed didn’t wake up the other day and say “hey let’s go drop some sarin gas on such and such village”  assad told them to do it  now they are dead and assad is ordering new planes from russia  what’s the idea here that the syrian military is going to refuse to do the bad things that assad tells them to do because we might send some tomahawks their way  newsflash assad is a lot more scary than  tomahawk missiles  the missile will kill you instantly  assad might take weeks to kill you  and he’ll probably kill your family too by the way those missiles cost anywhere from  to  million each depending on whom you believe  with tax day looming i’m reminded that i worked a whole year to pay for just part of one of those missiles   launched  deaths  there’s a good chance that the missile with my name on it didn’t kill anybody  i’d hate to think that i worked all year to kill a portion of a syrian not named assad if we really wanted to punish assad for gassing civilians shouldn’t we aim those missiles at his home and not some air force base  it sobered up qaddafi pretty quickly there’s something else i need help understanding  i don’t mean to sound callous but why is it so much worse to gas civilians than to kill them in other ways  assad kills hundreds of civilians every month and we were willing to accept that as a “political reality”  in fairness to assad shouldn’t we have given him a checklist  torture ok  extrajudicial execution ok  cluster bombs ok  indiscriminate shelling ok  landmines ok  gas unthinkable i shouldn’t be surprised that i don’t quite understand all this  nothing about the syrian war makes any sense  who’s fighting whom and for what  we know there’s assad and isis and al qaeda and turkey and russia and hezbollah and a few dozen militia that go in and out of business more often than a times square clip joint  for such a tiny country that doesn’t have natural resources or make anything of any significance syria has managed to cause outsized problems for the rest of the world  all the rich and developed countries that are suffering a major syrian headache are powerless to do anything about it it is mind boggling   posted in news  comments off oops sorry ‘bout that posted on april   by michael i guess that’s what you say to your client after it has paid you well over  million in fees on a case that wouldn’t have been brought if somebody like you maybe had read the damn contract international cards co is a company based in jordan and for about  years it was a mastercard “member”  don’t ask me what it means to be a member of mastercard i assume it means you can issue mastercard credit cards  anyway icc and mastercard had a contract and the contract stated in section  that a customer ie member may be terminated as a customer by the corporation ie mastercard the termination is effective upon delivery or an inability to deliver after a reasonable attempt to do so of written or actual notice by the corporation to the customer on april   mastercard delivered a letter to icc which stated that mastercard had terminated the contract pursuant to section  pretty simple eh  member terminated  maybe it’s not a nice thing for mastercard to do but that was the agreement  shed no tears for icc  if you’re sophisticated enough to issue credit cards you should be able to read a simple contract way more simple than what is written in tiny letters on the back of my mastercard statement not so simple  after the provision quoted above the contract stated that mastercard could terminate the agreement without any prior notice for a number of reasons such as nonpayment of fees  apparently somebody at icc took that to mean mastercard could terminate the contract only for one of those reasons  since icc didn’t believe that any of the “without any prior notice” conditions were applicable and it sued mastercard for breach of contract  that was in april   as in four years ago the interpretation of a contract is a legal issue which means that a judge not a jury decides  technically this is only when the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous but guess who decides whether the language is clear and unambiguous  yep the judge  you might think that when mastercard got sued it showed the judge the contract and said “look your honor the contract said that we could terminate a member at any time so we can’t be sued for breach of contract”  in legal parlance this is done by a motion to dismiss which can be made at the very beginning of the case and often is in contract cases not here  for reasons unknown mastercard did not ask to have the case dismissed instead it and icc slugged it out for almost four years  then on the very eve of trial mastercard pointed out that it had the right to terminate the contract just by sending a letter and it asked for the case to be dismissed why did mastercard wait four years to ask to have the case thrown out of court  that remains to be seen  the judge was not amused  although she had no choice but to dismiss the case she invited icc to make a motion for the attorneys’ fees it was forced to pay because mastercard waited so long to make its motion to dismiss  icc filed its motion asking to be reimbursed its legal fees for bringing a case and losing  seppuku might be more appropriate here’s how icc’s motion starts off “following four years of litigation and millions of dollars in unnecessary fees and expenses on both sides the parties and the court system are all losers” ahem  not “all” are losers  icc’s lawyers seem to have done just fine having charged their client a cool  million for the extraordinary results they obtained now i don’t know about you but i’d be kinda embarrassed taking  million from a client for bringing a lawsuit that a first year law student probably could have seen through on a contracts exam  and not for nothing but what’s with the fees  really that is almost exactly  a month for four years  just for comparison purposes i added up the time my firm put in on the crane case which has been going on now for over eight years included a mistrial a trial that lasted a full year several appeals and a bankruptcy  our time on that case has come out to  million give or take a few dollars  admittedly i had cocounsel so double my time i don’t get paid by the hour so i have no incentive to run up time charges or inflate bills i’m not saying that anybody has done so here obviously i don’t know that but i’m just saying  that’s a lot of legal fees posted in law  comments off friday rant — traitors are not real americans posted on november   by michael you would think it an obvious point  not to this trump supporter quoted in the washington post here’s a little history lesson  the confederate states rebelled against the united states of america  in other words confederates did not want to be americans in the sense of citizens of the united states of america  they rejected this great country  the took up arms against this great country  anybody who wears a confederate uniform is

of michael g o’neill the types of cases we handle law office of michael g o’neill  vesey street third floor new york new york    a supreme court scandal how bad is the current supreme court that question is probably easier to ask than answer but make no mistake about it the current supreme court is squarely in the camp of political conservatives in case after case by razor thin  decisions this court is tearing up established legal precedent and by judicial fiat accomplishing a sea change in the nations laws in a way that could never be accomplished through the legislative process so much for judicial restraint on june   the supreme court issued two decisions in the area of employment discrimination one of them university of texas southwestern medical center v nassar decided the issue of the “causation” requirement for a claim of retaliation under title vii “title vii” refers to the section in the civil rights act of  that makes discrimination in employment based on race sex and religion illegal causation just like it sounds is the requirement that the retaliatory action actually cause some type of harm to the employee at this point you might be wondering why this is an issue now after all title vii became law in   years ago since causation is an essential element in any case what have the courts been doing all these years in fact that is an excellent question and the process of answering it shows just how bad the current supreme court is back in the early s a woman by the name of hopkins was denied partnership in price waterhouse a large accounting firm she sued claiming sex discrimination and at trial it was established that hopkins gender had played a role in pws denial of partnership as well as a number of other permissible considerations since both an unlawful consideration – the fact that hopkins was a woman – and lawful considerations had led to pws decision the question arose whether hopkins had been denied partnership “because of” her sex pw argued that the permissible factors alone would have led it to deny partnership to her therefore her gender was not the cause of the denial the argument really boiled down to who would have to prove what would hopkins have to prove that she would have been given the partnership “but for” her gender or did pw have to prove that it would have denied her partnership even if it had not taken her gender into consideration the case made its way to the supreme court which decided by a  vote that once hopkins had shown that her gender played a part in pws decision making process pw had the burden of proof to show that it would have made the same decision anyway even if it had not taken hopkins sex into consideration a few years later congress past the  amendments to the civil rights act of  and in so doing incorporated the rule made by the supreme court into the act but made it stronger under the rule made by the supreme court a defendant could escape all liability by proving that it would have taken the same employment action even if it did not discriminate congress modified this escape hatch so that the employer can avoid some but not all aspects of liability by so proving the key thing to remember is that congress made it clear that the supreme court got it right on the issue of causation and who had to prove what – but it felt that the court went too far in providing a way to let employers who discriminated off the hook the price waterhouse case involved discrimination title vii also prohibits retaliation and it uses the same “because of” language for outlawing retaliation as it does for discrimination in other words it is illegal to take some employment action “because of” the fact that the employee made a complaint about discrimination or opposed discriminatory conduct not surprisingly the courts have generally applied to same standards for proving cases of discrimination and retaliation fast forward to the present this week we learned that when congress approved the supreme courts interpretation of the words “because of” in the price waterhouse case involving discrimination it actually intended that the same “because of” language mean something different in cases involving retaliation in addition when congress strengthened the employees rights and remedies in cases involving discrimination it intended to weaken employees rights and remedies in cases involving discrimination how exactly did the supreme court reach this conclusion an irreverent and not wholly undeserved answer is “by pulling it out of its supreme a” a less flippant explanation is that the nassar decision can be explained only by changes in the makeup of the court when price waterhouse was decided the “hard right” block consisted of kennedy renquist and scalia today it is kennedy scalia thomas alito and roberts kennedy who dissented in price waterhouse wrote the majority opinion in nassar in simple terms in  when there were only three hard right justices the words “because of” meant one thing today because there are five hard right justices they mean something else this is the latest chapter in a slow moving scandal that seems to generate about as much interest as a tree falling in the woods we say that we are a nation of laws not men supreme court precedent is law when justices are appointed to the supreme court they are sworn to uphold the law and that includes existing supreme court precedent they are not free to overturn existing precedent simply because they disagree with it or would have voted differently if they had been on the court when the decision was originally made and yet that is exactly what happened in nassar and has been happening consistently with the current court this is a very ugly state of affairs and it is unlikely to change until one or more of the current hard right ideologues is replaced by a justice who takes the rule of law seriously the warning of justice thurgood marshall in his dissent in payne v tennessee was prescient power not reason is the new currency of this courts decisionmaking four terms ago a fivejustice majority of this court held that victim impact evidence of the type at issue in this case could not constitutionally be introduced during the penalty phase of a capital trial booth v maryland  us   by another  vote a majority of this court rebuffed an attack upon this ruling just two terms ago south carolina v gathers  us   nevertheless having expressly invited respondent to renew the attack  us   todays majority overrules booth and gathers and credits the dissenting views expressed in those cases neither the law nor the facts supporting booth and gathers underwent any change in the last four years only the personnel of this court did in dispatching booth and gathers to their graves todays majority ominously suggests that an even more extensive upheaval of this courts precedents may be in store renouncing this courts historical commitment to a conception of the judiciary as a source of impersonal and reasoned judgments moragne v states marine lines  us     us   the majority declares itself free to discard any principle of constitutional liberty which was recognized or reaffirmed over the dissenting votes of four justices and with which five or more justices now disagree the implications of this radical new exception to the doctrine of stare decisis are staggering the majority today sends a clear signal that scores of established constitutional liberties are now ripe for reconsideration thereby inviting the very type of open defiance of our precedents that the majority rewards in this case because i believe that this court owes more to its constitutional precedents in general and to booth and gathers in particular i

cases we handle law office of michael g o’neill  vesey street third floor new york new york    the tort reform debate the medical malpractice insurance crisis did you know how real is the medical malpractice insurance crisis we are being told that rising insurance rates are forcing doctors to stop practicing medicine jury verdicts are out of control frivolous lawsuits brought by greedy trial lawyers drive up the cost of medicine and this hurts everyone we need caps the usual proposal is  for pain and suffering and limitations and attorneys contingency fees is there any truth to this lets examine each and every one of these claims and see if we can make any sense out of all of it first lets break these claims into their individual components insurance rates are rising doctors are leaving the practice of medicine jury verdicts are out of control frivolous lawsuits drive up the cost of medicine caps on damages and contingency fees will solve the problem insurance rates are rising let us assume this to be true put aside the fact that the generality of the assertion makes it meaningless lets just assume it to be true what does this fact in itself mean insurance is a business while this seems self evident it implies a number of truths that seem to get lost in the rhetoric like any business insurance companies are driven by self interest ie to make as much money as possible they have no concern about the greater good of society directors and officers of corporations are duty bound to make decisions that maximize the profits to the shareholders of the corporation this is just a fundamental fact about corporations it is not disputed by anyone i invite anyone who disputes this fact to post his or her disagreement in the forum and well have an interesting debate on the subject since insurance companies are in business to make a profit they want to maximize their revenues there are two sources of revenues for an insurance company  insurance premiums and investments we hear about premiums all the time but we never hear about investments but if the revenues generated by investments fall then the insurance company must raise premiums to make up the difference again this is an accepted fact about insurance companies and you wont find any real disagreement on this point so we know that falling investment income can cause premiums to rise yet we hear nothing in the debate about this subject how important are investment revenues think about how insurance works in year one the doctor pays the premium in some states he can be sued years later for malpractice committed in year one in new york its generally two and a half years after the last treatment for the condition in question it can also takes years for the lawsuit to get to trial what this means is that the insurance company may collect the premium in year one but not pay any money out for claims incurred in year one for anywhere from three to ten years during all this time the insurance company is investing the money insurance companies therefore must make certain assumptions about the revenue generated by investments in order to predict the amount of money that will be available in the future to pay claims if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate the only quick fix is to raise insurance premiums another fact that is often obscured is the fact that insurance companies compete for business like all other business insurance is cyclical meaning it has good times and bad times in fact the insurance industry is notoriously cyclical and during good times insurance companies engage in fierce price competition to sell policies it is not unusual for an insurance company to sell insurance for less than the amount of claims they expect to pay they do this to generate cash flow and one way they justify this is to make exaggerated assumptions about the investment income they will earn on the premiums invariably when the cycle snaps the companies are in a bind and must raise premiums although this has occurred countless times i have never seen an insurance company attribute its increase in premiums to its own irresponsible business practices i can assure you that you will never see this who is going to buy insurance from a company that essentially engaged in speculation somebody has to be blamed and the greedy trial lawyers are an easy target where do insurance companies invest their money if they are based in the united states they are regulated by state insurance departments and must invest conservatively they are not allowed to invest heavily in the stock market and they typically buy safe interest rate securities such as government bonds insurance companies also are one of the largest sources of money for real estate loans since this is considered a safe type of investment activity well if you have any kind of saving or money market account you know what has happened to interest rates in the past five years they are at an all time low you can check this out but i believe interest rates have fallen by about fifty percent in the past five years for insurance companies this means a dramatic loss in investment revenue of course there are other factors too the stock market has tanked and we have been in a recession or stagnant economy for several years all of these factors have nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits trial lawyers out of control verdicts and the like now here is an interesting fact higher premiums mean higher profits for insurance companies this is rather self evident and you would think that insurance companies favor higher premiums but the insurance companies all favor the so called tort reform initiatives why is that well there can be only one reason they favor them and thats because they expect to make more money if those laws are passed its as simple as that the directors and officers of insurance companies are duty bound and legally obligated to promote the self interest of the insurance companies and that can only mean that they can support these laws only if they expect to make higher profits as a result you can be assured that insurance companies have a very effective lobby and do not hesitate to oppose laws that threaten their profits so if higher premiums mean higher profits why do insurance companies favor these proposed laws the answer is pretty obvious these proposed laws guarantee that insurance companies will pay out less money in claims but they dont require insurance companies to lower their premiums its as simple as that insurance companies are not forced to lower their premiums and doctors are not forced to lower their fees that would be unamerican it would violate the basic principals of our free market system to impose limits on prices and income of course its perfectly alright to limit the rights of those injured by mistakes of doctors and its perfectly alright to limit the income of the greedy trial lawyers but insurance companies and doctors should be free to charge whatever they can get and earn as much money as they can here you see a perfect illustration of one of the basic hypocritical tenets of the socalled conservative values it is not the business of government to solve problems for individuals but it is the business of government to solve problems for large businesses it is not a proper function of government to ensure that all americans have equal access to health care but it is the governments duty to protect the profits of insurance companies and the incomes of doctors doctors are leaving the practice of medicine because of malpractice rates where is the evidence of this that is all i ask where is there any evidence of this at all lets not rely on radio talk shows and sound bites from politicians has your doctor stopped practicing medicine is it because of malpractice insurance have you or anyone you know been unable to find a doctor because weve just run out of doctors we have all this hysteria in the news and media but i have yet to find a single individual who can say i cant get medical care because of the so called malpractice insurance crisis the amazing thing to me is that it is a documented fact that we have millions of americans who have no or limited access to health care because they cannot afford it but the idea of a few dozen doctors not being able to afford malpractice insurance gives rise to a federal initiative to regulate malpractice lawsuits this notion violates multiple principles of so called conservative values  free markets small government individualism self reliance states rights etc but as we see over and over again there is enough hypocrisy in the so called conservative values to choke an elephant the federal government mobilizes its forces to help doctors and insurance companies but ordinary individuals get left out in the cold i have a proposal why not have the government hire any doctor who cannot afford malpractice insurance to provide health care to the public on a means tested fee basis the doctor would be indemnified against lawsuits by the federal government this solves the problem of the doctor and ensures that we dont lose any medical practitioners to the malpractice crisis and it avoids punishing the victims of medical malpractice the only problem it doesnt solve is the problem of the insurance companies so it will never be seriously considered plus it reeks of socialism because it provides government benefits to individuals so instead of providing benefits directly to individuals we provide benefits to large insurance companies and we call it capitalism well in fact its really capitalist socialism these are the true conservative values jury verdicts are out of control again i have to ask where is the evidence of this in fact i dont even know what this means what is an out of control jury verdict i suppose its one you disagree with what would an in control jury verdict be these are just nonsensical terms really theyre just rhetoric propaganda there is no such thing as an out of control jury verdict every jury verdict is under the control of the trial judge if a defendant believes that a verdict is unreasonable or outlandish it can ask the judge to reduce or set aside the verdict and if the defendant is unsatisfied with the trial judges decision it can take that decision to appeal therefore before any defendant has to pay any verdict the trial judge and the appeals court typically three to seven judges has to approve the reasonableness of that verdict as every trial lawyer knows jury verdicts are often reduced sometimes i think it is the judges who are out of control so i have to ask with these safeguards in place where are the out of control verdicts of course we have all read reports of unbelievable verdicts in the newspapers these verdicts are never paid they are reduced they are such an unbelievable minority of verdicts that is what makes them newsworthy every day hundreds if not thousands of verdicts are rendered in courts across the country how many verdicts make the news can you imagine the headline that reads jury reaches fair verdict or jury awards modest damages for severe injury you will not read about this but it happens every day so yes it is true that every once in a while there is a report of a jury verdict that baffles the reader even i am baffled from time to time by these stories but these verdicts are never paid and when they are reduced or reversed or settled for a modest amount of money they dont make the news so you may be left with the impression that there are out of control jury verdicts and this is the impression that the huge propaganda effort of the insurance and medical lobby is reinforcing when it talks about out of control jury verdicts but there are no out of control jury verdicts frivolous lawsuits drive up the cost of medicine the truth is that if all so called frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits were eliminated it would not change the cost of medicine at all this is because total malpractice premiums make up a very small percentage of the cost of medicine and frivolous malpractice lawsuits make up a very small percentage of malpractice lawsuits lets start with the concept of the cost of medicine for most purposes the cost of medicine is the cost of medical insurance since that is how the majority buy health care so where does the health care dollar go well about half of the money spent on medical insurance actually goes to health care itself thats right about half the other half goes to the insurance brokers who sell the insurance and to the administrative costs and profits of the insurance companies themselves now im talking about health care insurance not medical malpractice insurance we havent even gotten to that yet the medical malpractice insurance is paid by doctors and hospitals out of the fifty cents of the health care dollar that they get so right away you can see that the half of the money spent on health care just goes to insurance companies and brokers if you doubt me just ask an insurance broker in new york the cost of medical insurance for family coverage is around  to  per month for a pretty basic type of coverage how much of that goes to the broker would you be surprised to know that it is not uncommon for  or  a month or more to go to the broker this is a huge amount of money and there are a lot of insurance brokers making fortunes selling health insurance brokers commissions are not regulated in many cases the broker itself can add whatever amount to the cost of the insurance that he wants in order to maximize his commission there is no initiative to lower broker commissions that would be unamerican so out of the fifty percent of the health care dollar that actually goes to health care how much is spent on malpractice insurance premiums this is a hard number to get to there is just so much misinformation out there and both sides of the debate spin the numbers to bolster their arguments for example the insurance and medical lobby likes to include the cost of defensive medicine as part of the cost of malpractice suits what is defensive medicine its generally defined as tests or procedures whose primary purpose is not to advance the health of the patient but to defend against allegations of malpractice well this is awfully subjective its also a very convenient way for the industry to deflect criticism against the high cost of medicine lets take the case of obstetricians most of the malpractice horror stories are about obstetricians i have seen reports of obstetricians in some states paying as high as  per year for malpractice insurance case closed you might think well lets look at this worst case scenario and you can be sure its being reported because it is the worst case scenario and not the typical situation faced by most doctors how many babies does an obstetrician delivery per year do you think one per day or about five per week is about right it seems about right to me im trying to get some accurate information on this so if anyone can point me to some reliable sources i would be grateful i estimate that at five per week an obstetrician would see about  woman a day for office visits at one half hour per visit thats five hours a day for prenatal care and one delivery per working day intuitively this seems reasonable to me but if im wrong email me or post something in the forum home page read the oneillaw blog contact info one click contact first name  last name  email  phone number  doing

do you should be inspired and inspire others we don’t do anything that we don’t believe in nobody works in my office who does not believe in what we do handle every case like it’s our only case lawyers like to brag about the big cases they handle it makes them feel important big case  important case lawyer handling big case  important lawyer everyone likes to feel important i get that there’s an assumption that if a lawyer has a big case he or she must be a good lawyer not always true but that’s a different story altogether i want to brag about a small case that i handled my client was a hard working immigrant from kenya working in the security department of a large chain discount department store in addition to his full time job he was going to college at night and he and his wife were working very hard to make a better life for themselves and their young child his complaint was that he kept getting passed over for a promotion and he had reason to believe that his race was the reason the promotion in question was very modest and would have increased my client’s pay by little more than a dollar an hour but to him and his family it would have made a big difference in their tight budget i took his case and filed a lawsuit on his behalf after a while we managed to work out a settlement to my client’s satisfaction it was a small case and a small settlement but i will never forget how grateful my client was he told me how much it had meant to him that i believed in him and took his case and fought for him he didn’t talk about the money at all which was certainly modest enough but just the fact that i had cared when nobody else did and how he was able to get some measure of justice against this huge corporation even though this was almost  years ago i think about this client often there are times when i have to tell a client that his or her case might be too small to justify a lawsuit but i never for a minute think that i am too important to take that or any other meritorious case i know that the real injury caused by discrimination is not to the bank account but to the human soul and that injury doesn’t feel any different in a big case or a small case i would be an idiot to pretend that i don’t like or want big cases of course i do but sometimes it’s the small cases that really move me and inspire me to go that extra distance for a client home

who wont abuse your trust or drain your finances you have to make the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle the more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with

accidents trip and falls medical malpractice dangerous and defective products wrongful death labor and worker rights unpaid wages unpaid overtime wage and hour claims unfair union representation whistleblower claims i am often asked if i handle cases on a contingency fee basis the answer is yes in fact virtually every case i handle is on a contingency fee basis the fact of the matter is that very few people can afford to pay the legal fees of a top flight lawyer corporations can and do and this gives them a huge advantage its no accident that the overwhelming majority of individuals who sue corporations without the assistance of a lawyer lose their cases the contingency fee levels the playing field this is why business interests have mounted such a concentrated attack against contingency fees they call this tort reform this is hypocrisy at its height corporations pay their lawyers up to  per hour but they want to prevent individuals from hiring quality lawyers home page
