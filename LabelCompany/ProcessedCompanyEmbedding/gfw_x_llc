championship wrestling wcw ended in  bob ryder jeff jarrett and jerry jarrett went on a fishing trip and contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business only one wrestling product remained on united states national television the world wrestling federation wwf later wwe ryder felt that this situation led many television stations to regard professional wrestling as bad for business so he suggested a company not reliant on television but rather one going straight to payperviewin july  vince russo joined jeff and jerry jarretts nwatna promotion as a creative writer and would assist in the writing and production of the shows russo states that he coined the name total nonstop action the initials of the company tna being a play on ta short for tits and ass the original intention as they were exclusive to payperview was to be viewed as an edgier product than wwe the jarretts found the financial backing they needed and the company put on its first show on june   that night however in a dark match just before they went on the air a  lb wrestler named cheex hit the ropes with so much force that one of them broke the estimated repair time was – minutes which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes whether the ring was ready or not backstage the producers shuffled the schedule so that some nonwrestling segments went first to give the ring crew some more time but they did not have many of them the ring crew fixed the rope with the help of ron and don harris and everyone went live hoping for the best initially tnas

contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business only one wrestling product remained on united states national television the world wrestling federation wwf later wwe ryder felt that

much force that one of them broke the estimated repair time was – minutes which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes whether the ring was ready or not

force wrestling has worked with several international wrestling promotions with championships from those promotions sometimes having been defended at gfw events among the organizations gfw has worked with are mexicos consejo mundial de lucha libre cmll japans inoki genome federation igf new japan prowrestling njpw wrestle w and americas evolve wrestling tnas relationship with njpw lasted from  to  and included tna sending wrestlers to participate in njpws annual wrestle kingdom event as well as njpw sending future iwgp heavyweight champion kazuchika okada on a training excursion to tna however the relationship soured in  when iwgp tag team champions team d were held off of a new japan tour in favor of appearing on impact wrestling and okada was given a green hornetinspired gimmick on march   tna collaborated with wrestle in producing the kaisen outbreak supershow in tokyo japan where three tna championships were defended in may  it was reported that the relationship between tna and

omega championship wrestling owned by matt hardy jeff hardy and gregory helms featuresedit for most of its history gfw has used a hexagonal ring x divisionedit main article x division highflying high risk moves are a centerpiece of the x division since its origin gfw has featured a highflying high risk style of wrestling known as its x division rather than emphasizing the fact that most wrestlers who perform this style are under  lb  kg by calling it a cruiserweight division gfw then tna decided to emphasize the high risk nature of the moves that these wrestlers perform removing all restraints on its wrestlers allowing them to perform almost stunt like wrestling movescitation needed originally there was no weight limit on the x division or its title though in practice most of the wrestlers in this division have been cruiserweights with samoa joe billed at  lb  kg kurt angle billed at  lb  kg and abyss billed at  lb  kg being notable exceptionscitation needed to further emphasize this point the slogan its not about weight limits its about no limits was used to describe the divisioncitation needed although it was deemphasized throughout  the x division is generally regardedwho as one of the key attractions of gfw and was replicated in several other promotionscitation needed in august  a  lb  kg weight limit was introduced this was quietly repealed in march  changes introduced in march  including a weight limit of  lbs and making all matches triple threat matches were repealed in august six sided ringedit from the promotions first show in june  until june  tna used a standard foursided wrestling ring in  with the premier of impact tna switched to a sixsided ring as seen occasionally in the mexican promotion aaa tna used the sixsided ring until  a fanvoted poll to

regularly for various promotions on the independent circuit in addition to gfw weekly shows in  gfw then tna changed policy preventing its talent from appearing at any independent events that are later released on dvd however this was later altered due to the lack of tna shows in late  and many tna wrestlers appeared at independent events but were not allowed to appear on any tv or payperview tapingscitation needed the top gfw wrestlers have guaranteed contracts but the majority of gfw wrestlers are paid on a per appearance basis gfw wrestlers are classified as independent contractors and

some to be the secondlargest professional wrestling promotion in the united states after wwe while others list it third behind ring of honor roh founded by jeff and jerry jarrett in  the promotion was initially known as nwa total nonstop action nwatna and was associated with the national wrestling alliance nwa it withdrew from the nwa in  and became known as total nonstop action wrestling tna but it continued to use the nwa world heavyweight and the nwa world tag team championships as part of an agreement after the agreement ended in  the company created its own tna world heavyweight and tna

of tna originated shortly after world championship wrestling wcw ended in  bob ryder jeff jarrett and jerry jarrett went on a fishing trip and contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business only one wrestling product remained on united states national television the world wrestling federation wwf later wwe ryder felt that this situation led many television stations to regard professional wrestling as bad for business so he suggested a company not reliant on television but rather one going straight to payperviewin july  vince russo joined jeff and jerry jarretts nwatna promotion as a creative writer and would assist in the writing and production of the shows russo states that he coined the name total nonstop action the initials of the company tna being a play on ta short for tits and ass the original intention as they were exclusive to payperview was to be viewed as an edgier product than wwe the jarretts found the financial backing they needed and the company put on its first show on june   that night however in a dark match just before they went on the air a  lb wrestler named cheex hit the ropes with so much force that one of them broke the estimated repair time was – minutes which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes whether the ring was ready or not backstage the producers shuffled the schedule so that some nonwrestling segments went first to give the ring crew some more time but they did not have many of them the ring crew fixed the rope with the help of ron and don harris and everyone went live hoping for the best initially tnas weekly payperview show operated as the companys main source of revenue in place of monthly payperview events used by other promotions these shows took place mostly at the tennessee state fairground sports arena in nashville tennessee nicknamed the tna asylum after  months and  payperview events tna began holding a weekly television show and monthly

contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business only one wrestling product remained on united states national television the world wrestling federation wwf later wwe ryder felt that

vince russo joined jeff and jerry jarretts nwatna promotion as a creative writer and would assist in the writing and production of the shows russo states that he coined the name total nonstop action the initials of the company tna being a play on ta short for tits and ass the original intention as they were exclusive to payperview was to be viewed as an edgier product than wwe the jarretts found

much force that one of them broke the estimated repair time was – minutes which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes whether the ring was ready or not

of tna originated shortly after world championship wrestling wcw ended in  bob ryder jeff jarrett and jerry jarrett went on a fishing trip and contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business only one wrestling product remained on united states national television the world wrestling federation wwf later wwe ryder felt that this situation led many television stations to regard professional wrestling as bad for business so he suggested a company not reliant on television but rather one going straight to payperviewin july  vince russo joined jeff and jerry jarretts nwatna promotion as a creative writer and would assist in the writing and production of the shows russo states that he coined the name total nonstop action the initials of the company tna being a play on ta short for tits and ass the original intention as they were exclusive to payperview was to be viewed as an edgier product than wwe the jarretts found the financial backing they needed and the company put on its first show on june   that night however in a dark match just before they went on the air a  lb wrestler named cheex hit the ropes with so much force that one of them broke the estimated repair time was – minutes which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes whether the ring was ready or not backstage the producers shuffled the schedule so that some nonwrestling segments went first to give the ring crew some more time but they did not have many of them the ring crew fixed the rope with the help of ron and don harris and everyone went live hoping for the best initially tnas weekly payperview show operated as the companys main source of revenue in place of monthly payperview events used by other promotions these shows took place

the pattern of payperview shows that continued until  dixie carter was president of tna from – the television contract with fox sports expired in may  and was not renegotiated leaving tna without

known as its x division rather than emphasizing the fact that most wrestlers who perform this style are under  lb  kg by calling it a cruiserweight division gfw then tna decided to emphasize the high risk nature of the moves that these wrestlers perform removing all restraints on its wrestlers allowing them to perform almost stunt like wrestling movescitation needed originally there was no weight limit on the x division or its title though in practice most of the wrestlers in this division have been cruiserweights with samoa joe billed at  lb  kg kurt angle billed at  lb  kg and abyss billed at  lb  kg being notable exceptionscitation needed to further emphasize this point the slogan its not about weight limits its about no limits was used to describe the divisioncitation needed although it was deemphasized throughout  the x division is generally regardedwho as one of the key attractions of gfw and was replicated in several other promotionscitation needed in august  a  lb  kg weight limit was introduced this was quietly repealed in march  changes introduced in march  including a weight limit of  lbs and making all matches triple threat matches were repealed in august six sided

contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business only one wrestling product remained on united states national television the world wrestling federation wwf later wwe ryder felt that this situation led many television stations to regard professional wrestling as bad for business so he suggested a company not reliant on television but rather one going straight to payperviewin july  vince russo joined jeff and jerry jarretts nwatna promotion as a creative writer and would assist in the writing and production of the shows russo states that he coined the name total nonstop action the initials of the company tna being a play on ta short for tits and ass the original intention as they were exclusive to payperview was to be viewed as an edgier product than wwe the jarretts found
