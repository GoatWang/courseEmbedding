leadership forum kim kw rucker of avon products inc delivered a speech on the subject of legal organization in the corporate sector moving forward rucker began with a brief overview of avon its history its ethos and its strategy avon she said was an  billion company and was the world’s single largest seller of beauty products avon she said took advantage of the directsell channel which helped them to navigate the changing and sometimes negative economic landscape they sold to  million women in over a hundred countries which made them one of the world’s largest consumer products firms the firm she said had a deceptively complex business model despite the prevailing opinion that the business dealings of a makeup company must be fairly simple “we’re creating a thousand new products a year so lipstick sounds pretty simple until you put it in that complex mix let’s go back to the mission of avon the company for women without being politically incorrect the studies will show  our fastest growth is in emerging and developing markets  you give a woman a dollar she invests it in her family her children her extended family and her community” rucker believed that the high volume of women employed by her firm made it a more successful firm at investing its money as male investors she said would only spent money on “women liquor and tobacco” a big part of the mission of avon she said was to empower women and her mission as avon’s chief legal officer was to create as organized and effective a legal system as possible to this end rucker claimed that she reorganize the company as a kind of matrix which would match a similar grid system used for the business end of the company creating a uniform system that was mutually intelligible between the legal and business sides of the company was essential next rucker said that she made another organized list of where all of the meetings in the firm were held which quickly dispelled the notion that the firm’s power was at its offices in new york the power rucker said was in the field where people were out every day doing the legwork that made the company run the goal of the legal department she said was to create a situation in which the legal team with their wide variety of expertise could enable the business end of the firm “instill in your lawyers the ability to think and not feel like a cost center but to say that we are a business enabler we can be a profit center and we are the buscrash avoider department what i noticed is that we didn’t have a way of capturing all of those value adds that were happening all over the legal department in translating them to the business case for the business people so good things would be happening all over the company all over the world but it was never getting translated and captured” related articles a ford motor company executive’s take on the constitution – david g leitch group vice president and general counsel ford motor company intellectual
