after observing archipelago holdings be acquired by the new york stock exchange and instinet be acquired by nasdaq within a week of each other in  after the launch of bats other brokerage firms hedge funds and other clients became involved with the company cummings publicized the bats service by sending emails to companies highlighting the niche that could be carved out by trading on platforms other than the big two—nasdaq and nyse the niche that he sought for the company was for it to be a neutral private brokerdealer owned semiprofitable utility with no party owning more than  percent he noted that the consolidation of the new york stock exchange and nasdaq eliminated competition and they raised prices for their services the bats system was intended to charge less among the items it did to draw customers was to offer free listings to companies with shares that traded a certain amount each day cummings stepped down in  and was replaced by joe ratterman who had been associated with the company from the start cummings said in his resignation as bats prepares to become an exchange my ownership of a brokerdealer precludes me from serving in management cummings returned to his position as ceo at tradebot european expansionedit under the leadership of joe ratterman in march  bats entered the european equities markets by establishing a multilateral trading facility mtf to compete on a paneuropean basis against the incumbent securities exchanges bats europe was formally launched in october  in february  bats global markets agreed to buy chix europe a competitor and largest paneuropean mtf at the time for  million the deal was referred by the office of fair trading to the competition commission in june  for further investigation to determine whether a substantial lessening of competition is probable as a result of the anticipated merger however the competition commission approved the transaction in late november  leading to bats closing the deal on  november  in april  bats global markets confirmed that mark hemsley ceo of bats europe will be appointed ceo of the combined entity following bats’ acquisition of chix europe by april  the technology integration between the two platforms was complete and chix europe customers were migrated onto the bats europe platform initial public offeringedit the company attempted to go public on march   as the first listing on its own exchange but later withdrew the ipo the same day due to a disastrous glitch in the companys trading systems the glitch resulted in bats’ stock price falling from the

canceled bats halted stocks on its exchange that were affected by the glitch and included stocks with ticker symbols beginning with letters a to bfzzz it later reopened trading in the affected symbols

was announced that bats was to be acquired by cboe holdings in early  and will pay about us billion for it the transaction closed on march    operationsedit united statesedit in the united states bats operates two stock exchanges the bzx exchange and the byx exchange the bats exchanges which as of  accounted for about  of all us equity trading on a daily basis bzx and byx are different chiefly

joined as general counsel in january  in  company president william obrien disputed assertions in the book flash boys a wall street revolt he was quoted in the new york times as saying about the books author michael lewis clearly has a blind side as we’ve just discovered obrien was referring to a previous work by the journalist the paper reported obriens twitter account was active and he engaged in a heated debate on live tv with lewis on cnbc in the first days of the books release and after an appearance by lewis on  minutes in the exchange with lewis and iex ceo brad katsuyama he denied that direct edge used low speed data sources for public pricing of trades a point katsuyama noted would support his own assertion that markets such as direct edge were structured to favor highfrequency
