mobile view alphabet alphabet is for google as sergey and i wrote in the original founders letter  years ago “google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one” as part of that we also said that you could expect us to make “smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses” from the start we’ve always strived to do more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have more we did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time many of those crazy things now have over a billion users like google maps youtube chrome and android and we haven’t stopped there we are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about we’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing just making incremental changes but in the technology industry where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant our company is operating well today but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable so we are creating a new company called alphabet i am really excited to be running alphabet as ceo with help from my capable partner sergey as president what is alphabet alphabet is mostly a collection of companies the largest of which of course is google this newer google is a bit slimmed down with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in alphabet instead what do we mean by far afield good examples are our health efforts life sciences that works on the glucosesensing contact lens and calico focused on longevity fundamentally we believe this allows us more management scale as we can run things independently that aren’t very related alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence in general our model is to have a strong ceo who runs each business with sergey and me in service to them as needed we will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well we’ll also make sure we have a great ceo for each business and we’ll determine their compensation in addition with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our q results where google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of alphabet businesses as a whole this new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of google a key part of this is sundar pichai sundar has been saying the things i would have said and sometimes better for quite some time now and i’ve been tremendously enjoying our work together he has really stepped up since october of last year when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses sergey and i have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company and it is clear to us and our board that it is time for sundar to be ceo of google i feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations i have been spending quite a bit of time with sundar helping him and the company in any way i can and i will of course continue to do that google itself is also making all sorts of new products and i know sundar will always be focused on innovation—continuing to stretch boundaries i know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world’s information recent launches like google photos and google now using machine learning are amazing progress google also has some services that are run with their own identity like youtube susan is doing a great job as ceo running a strong brand and driving incredible growth sergey and i are seriously in the business of starting new things alphabet will also include our x lab which incubates new efforts like wing our drone delivery effort we are also stoked about growing our investment arms ventures and capital as part of this new structure alphabet inc will replace google inc as the publiclytraded entity and all shares of google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of alphabet with all of the same rights google will become a whollyowned subsidiary of alphabet our two classes of shares will continue to trade on nasdaq as googl and goog for sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of google—the birth of alphabet we liked the name alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanity’s most important innovations and is the core of how we index with google search we also like that it means alpha‑bet alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for i should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products—the whole point is that alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands we are excited about… getting more ambitious things done taking the longterm view empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see improving the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing making google even better through greater focus and hopefully… as a result of all this improving the lives of as many people as we can what could be better no wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the alphabet family don’t worry we’re still getting used to the name too alphabet inc

galaxy s htc u lg g here are the nine companies under alphabet inc january    written by kishalaya kundu in an unexpected move back in midaugust google announced a major restructuring of the company whereby all its noncore businesses were spun off as distinct entities that are separate from google’s bread and butter internet and related assets such as search ads adsense google maps google apps deepmind artificial intelligence research unit google atap research and of course android – all of which will continue to remain under the google brand a new holding company called alphabet inc was created which functions as the parent company for the new streamlined google as well as all other diverse and often unwieldy businesses most of the top management meanwhile kept their old designations at the new entity once the new structure became functional last october after getting the necessary regulatory clearances what that means in essence is that the two google cofounders larry page and sergey brin are now the ceo and the president respectively at alphabet having held those two exact positions at the old google at the time of the restructuring eric schmidt and david drummond have transitioned from being the chairman and chief counsel respectively at google to functioning in the exact same capacities at alphabet the thencfo at google ruth porat has assumed duties as the new cfo of both google and alphabet post restructuring meanwhile the thenvp of products at google sunder pichai has since taken over as the ceo of the single most valuable entity within the alphabet setup – google inc while there are as many as nine distinct companies currently within the alphabet fold another one is widely expected to join the list anytime now that would be the autonomous car project that has thus far been a part of google x google – and alphabet – however have been maintaining a studied silence regarding the issue thus far the current list of alphabet companies include google of course along with nest the home automation company and makers of the eponymous thermostat the company was acquired by google back in january  but continues to be headed by its celebrated cofounder and exapple employee tony fadell then there is access and energy – the company that’s responsible for the gigabit broadband service fiber verily the company that was known as google life sciences comes next followed by calico google’s biotech venture that looks to combat aging and associated illnesses next comes sidewalk labs an alphabetowned company that looks to improve urban living by tackling issues such as pollution energy usage and transportation coming to alphabet’s investment arm google capital is an equity fund that’s headed by david lawee whereas the venture capital division of the company gv formerly google ventures is led by bill maris last but definitely not the least is google x which is a hotbed for wacky and outthere research including project wing a drone delivery service project loon a service that aims to provide internet connectivity via balloons in the stratosphere and google glass – the controversial augmented reality eyewear that never quite caught on with mainstream consumers the way google would have wanted it to while the robotics unit of the company – replicant – was initially a separate company under alphabet it was recently incorporated within
