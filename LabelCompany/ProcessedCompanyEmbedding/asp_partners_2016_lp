statements made during this call and with that ill turn it over to jim a james teague  enterprise products partners lp thank you randy for the third quarter of  enterprise generated  billion in distributable cash flow our distributable cash flow was reduced by approximately  million because of precommissioning fees for our pdh plant and ethane export terminal and estimated expenses and lost revenues at our pascagoula gas processing plant which is expected to be up in the fourth quarter we increased our distribution by  during the quarter and retained  million of distributable cash flow yeartodate weve retained over  million of cash to reinvest in the business for the quarter we transported over  million barrels a day through our liquids pipelines and handled over  million barrels a day of liquids at our marine terminals our volumes were hurt somewhat by weak ethane recoveries industrywide lower volumes on our eagle ford crude oil pipeline down time and repairs at our pascagoula natural gas processing plant increases in gross operating margin from many of our feebased businesses partially offset these lower volumes while some things like ethane economics are beyond our control and did impact our volumes we continue to be very aggressive in keeping volumes moving through our system the third quarters typically our weakest but our people using our integrated system continued to perform at what are still tough market conditions signs continue to point to improved fundamentals crude oil prices have nearly doubled since february the us oil rig count is up over  or  since may theres signs that global inventories will balance in the second half of next year and there appears to be discussions by opec to freeze their output since august ethane has gone from  to  a gallon propane from  to  butane from  to  and natural gasoline from  to  the value of an ngl barrel in south texas has gone from  in early august to over  today while the move up in oil from the mids in february has been impressive theres also been improvement in natural gas prices where the calendar strip for  has gone from  to over  since march these types of oil gas and ngl prices put a lot of basins in the us in the black and have given us producers the ability to hedge  drilling programs as to projects in september we placed our ethane export terminal in service at morgans point projects like this truly are exciting and were extremely proud our people were able to complete a world scale project of this size on time and under budget we also announced that we added propylene export capabilities to our houston ship channel facility after we complete our pdh plant early next year enterprise will have the capability to produce  billion pounds per year of propylene and we fully expect the enterprise will play an increasing role in the global propylene trade during the third quarter we began service at our delaware basin gas processing facility where volumes are currently ramping this plant is on  with oxy we also built an ngl take away line from the plant that connects to our chaparral pipeline and given our focus on value chain moves the liquids to our mont belvieu facility our texas intrastate gas pipeline is providing the natural gas take away at the tailgate of the plant this is the second major plant we placed into service in the delaware basin this year weve started construction on our third plant in the permian a  a day plant in the delaware supported by our long term contracts with major producers with startup projected to be in the second quarter of  were not finished adding assets to serve this basin all in we have  billion of projects under construction and we have several major projects under development some that we hope to announce before year end you cant ignore whats been happening in our industry over the last six months the announcement around a potential opec production freeze is certainly encouraging but weve had very positive momentum since march that had nothing to do with the freeze at enterprise we really dont focus on what opec does we focus on what we do global demand continues to increase by over  million barrels a day per year and us producers continue to reduce their costs of finding and producing while frankly weaker producing nations are struggling to compete the reality is that while it feels like bad news comes all at once the path to recovery is never smooth we are optimistic but we are also realists we believe we are at the inflection point of a recovery phase it wont be fast it will be volatile over at enterprise weve never feared volatility we embrace it with that ill turn it over to bryan bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp thank you jim i will discuss a few notable income items for the third quarter provide an update on our growth and sustaining capital spending during the quarter along with expectations for the remainder of the year and close with an overview of our balance sheet metrics and capital raising activities for the quarter net income attributable to limited partners for the third quarter of  was  million or  per unit on a fully diluted basis compared to  million or  per unit on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of  asset impairment charges were  million for the third quarter  which is a  million decrease when compared to the same period in  we recognized a  million gain from the sale of our reno and rockland propane terminals in the third quarter of  versus a  million loss taken from the disposition of our offshore business in the third quarter of  ga expenses decreased  million this quarter primarily due to lower compensation and legal expenses total capital spending in the third quarter of  was  million which included  million for sustaining capital expenditures we expect organic growth capital expenditures for  to be approximately  billion and sustaining capital expenditures to come in around  million this year it should be noted the  billion second and final installment payment for the efs midstream assets made in july of  is excluded from the aforementioned capital spending figures at september   our total debt principal outstanding was  billion the average life of our debt portfolio was  years and our effective average cost of debt was  adjusted ebitda for the  months ended september   was  billion and our consolidated leverage ratio was slightly under  times after adjusting debt for the  equity treatment ascribed by the rating agencies for the hybrid debt securities and to further reduce per cash and cash equivalents this peak level of leverage is consistent with the guidance weve provided during the last several earnings conference calls as well as the peak metrics we presented to the rating agencies at the beginning of the year during our regularly scheduled annual review an important item to note and was referenced in last quarters earnings call is that we had approximately  billion of incremental debt or an incremental  times of leverage this is associated with working capital tied to marketing opportunities across commodities that are scheduled to liquidate over the fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of  further we anticipate modestly lower leverage metrics over the next several quarters as latestage growth projects come into service the aforementioned shortterm marketing inventory positions liquidate and an increasing contribution from completed projects with a contractual ramp in cash flows such as but not limited to our ethane export facility our aegis pipeline our efs midstream assets and our atex pipeline our disciplined approach towards appropriately managing the leverage over the long term has not changed where we continue to target leverage metrics at  to  times our leverage metrics remain in this range when adjusting for debt associated with growth projects under construction and applying their proportional contracted cash flow in addition to the  million of retained distributable cash flow during the third quarter we raised  million in net equity proceeds through our distribution reinvestment program our employee unit purchase program and the atthemarket or atm program as mentioned earlier in the year we largely prefunded the majority of our  equity needs during the first four months of  as a result and similar to my earlier comments on leverage and jims comments regarding an improving commodity price environment dcf coverage is typically at its lowest level during the seasonally weaker third quarter and should improve over the next few quarters finally our consolidated liquidity was approximately  billion at september   which included available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash i will now turn the call back over to randy john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp thank you bryan jennifer were ready to take questions from our participants – our audience questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of brian zarahn with mizuho brian zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc good morning everyone a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning brian brian zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc given the recent uptick in rig count activity in the permian any high level views of the impact to your asset base and any potential updates on the midlandtosealy pipe a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well i think the fact that we are starting construction on our third plant out there and the fact that my comments i said were not through obviously whats going on were paying a close attention to it and were pretty excited about it as to our midlands houston pipeline brian the pipe is purchased the rightofway is all but done over  of the rightofway i think were looking at aprilmay of  and were going to build the pipe and we think itll be full its initial capacity is  barrels a day and laurie weve got one two three contracts so its going to be a success i think its a project we needed and its a project that report to us and were going to expand brian zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc on the crude pipe any this incremental more interest in signing up capacity or its still under discussion a james teague  enterprise products partners lp say that again brian im sorry brian zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc i think your last update was about  of the pipe was contracted i guess any updates or any color on conversations with shipper is given the crude price recovery the rig count activity ma activity in the basin a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah were having more discussions on that pipe and its not going to surprise me if were not full when it comes up brian zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc okay and then the i guess my second question would be any broad strokes on some of the projects youre looking at any update on centennial a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah were pretty excited about the projects that i mentioned we have a handful that – when crude prices are in the s and gas prices are  organic projects gaining traction is kind of difficult what weve seen is weve got a handful of projects that were working on that are very exciting and i think well pull at least a couple of them if not three of them across the finish line and certainly centennial could be one of those brian zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc do you think centennial will be one of those by the end of the year that could be announced a james teague  enterprise products partners lp keep trying brian brian zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc i know youre cracking the whip jim i dont doubt that operator your next question comes from brian gamble with simmons  company brian gamble  simmons  company international that enthusiastic chuckle was a great little breather jim im sure youre doing a great job the question i wanted to focus on was on the ngl market you talked about the ethane economics and how its impacted volumes clearly theres still a pretty decent slate of crackers scheduled to come online by the end of  but jim can you walk us through anything thats changed in your mind or from a timing standpoint of balancing out that market as economics have been shifting clearly theyve been very volatile and you noted the upticks since august but when you look longer term maybe a few just opinions and broad strokes about where you see the industry and any changes that have developed in your mind over the past month or quarters a james teague  enterprise products partners lp when you have this much capacity come on things happen if you listen to tony and i do and these crackers come on and they run it right then youve got an appetite for ethane that cannot be supplied satisfied on the gulf coast so its got to attract volume from other places like the northeast or out of the rockies or out of the midcontinent if youre sitting in the permian or the eagle ford youre probably in pretty good shape from a margin perspective however those crackers come on and their ethylene margins compress and they dont run at the rates we expect them to then the appetite will be less ultimately they will run and they will attract ethane barrels from the northeast and from the rockies but it really doesnt hurt their competitiveness when you think about it because its still about the gas to crude spread so you can have ethane prices go up so that it supports transport out of the northeast or the rockies and the ethylene plant still be advantaged here relative to the rest of the world ill ask tony if he wants to add to that anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp jim ive got nothing to add thank you brian gamble  simmons  company international great and then my follow up i guess best place to just focus on that particular point when you guys mentioned your ethane export levels for q you note the year end  and year end  levels as well can you remind us of a how much additional capacity there is beyond those quoted rates and then b what sort of ebitda impact that could be by the end of next year a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i dont have the ebitda impact but joseph  weve got about   barrels a day of additional capacity to sell unknown speaker thats correct the total capacity is  barrels a day a james teague  enterprise products partners lp and were at about   in that range unknown speaker were probably around  a james teague  enterprise products partners lp  and i dont know pick a number   a gallon i screwed up your negotiation on your next deal but unknown speaker sure pick a number a james teague  enterprise products partners lp we say when joseph says our capacity is  barrels a day thats what we feel like our operational capacity is our instantaneous capacity is  barrels an hour or  barrels a day were going to be a little conservative in what we contract to until we get some experience under our belt but if the ethane facility has anything like our lpg facility well run that thing at over  operating rate and in my background i always thought  was fully utilized here we go over  and if we did that on ethane then weve got more to sell brian gamble  simmons  company international great thanks jim operator your next question comes from the line of brandon blossman with tudor pickering holt brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning everyone a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning brandon brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc right someones going to have to ask this question jim so ill be that person ma thoughts as you sit currently kind of balance of strategy versus valuation if something came in the door what would you rank one over the other and is there anything missing from your portfolio today as you look out over the next five years that youd like to add just from a commodity or a business line a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think randall whispered brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc i can add more if thats not enough a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah randall whispered in my ear that the answer to your question is yes yeah i think it – we may as well look at the elephant in the room we had some discussions along the lines of williams and obviously one of the things that we liked about that were their longhaul natural gas pipelines personally i dont think you build your way into that but if that was something that came available wed probably look at it but i think people – i mean we made some acquisitions recently and i think folks were looking at things almost every day from little to big but one of the things that excites us right now is seeing more organic projects that have darn good returns that we are in control of from the get go and while acquisitions could make sense price matters and were not going to chase them brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc all right well that is a comforting answer i think easier much easier question midlandsealy inch pipe current capacity  youve talked about being able to go up to  question is is that the absolute capacity  and what would capex requirements be to move up higher than that a james teague  enterprise products partners lp thats pretty much the absolute capacity isnt it laurie  and i dont know what the capex requirements are and i doubt id tell you if i did brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc just order of magnitude relatively minor a james teague  enterprise products partners lp its not that much no its incremental and its pumps brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thats expected and then just real quick in the prepared comments or actually in the news release some comments around eagle ford and haynesville signs of life any incremental color on that that you can provide anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yeah so lets start – this is tony brandon lets start with the haynesville where were seeing a significant change in operators new operators coming in acreage being sold applying new science – i shouldnt say new science applying science that has not been applied in that acreage and the results that were seeing generally are exceeding even what the new producers told us they were going to do so theyre very happy with their results relative to the eagle ford the eagle ford acreage is largely held by production you have im going to call it a hand full of major players down there that largely arent drilling because their acreage is held and they have an interest in holding acreage in other areas so we think some of that acreage is going to change hands just like weve seen starting in haynesville except the deals are going to be larger we feel very good about the eagle ford rock as we always have its now developed at what we believe is a commercial lean gas window and it sits probably in the best place in the whole country relative to markets so we believe that youll see acreage turn over in the eagle ford and drilling begin and  could well be the year that you see that process starting brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay perfect thank you tony operator your next question comes from the line of darren horowitz with raymond james darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc morning guys jim if i could i want to go back to reference the comment that you made about ethylene cracking capacity ramping into next year and i think weve got a pretty good idea of incremental ethane demand but more importantly from an ethylene production or supply perspective with the amount of polyethylene thats entering the market and the headwind that could have for ethylene prices when do you think we get to a point where it starts to impact economics back to the wellhead and maybe it starts to challenge this ethane recovery incentive that weve been seeing to the extent that it swings ethane frac spreads regionally into a more negative position or does it not anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp darren ill take that a james teague  enterprise products partners lp darren we give all the hard questions to tony anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp so if you just do the balances youre adding about  ethylene capacity in the us and its along the us gulf coast so do we see regional differences in netbacks in the future we absolutely do because if youre going to run all these plants youre going to need supplies from areas that have what ill call stranded ethylene ethane at the current time so that ethane is going to have to have a strong price signal for producers to plan on drilling it processing it and shipping it to the us i think thats the bottom line if ethane prices get too high then weve said before that its our anticipation that the merchant players are going to be ill call it the odd man out because they dont have the value chain to produce polyethylene and the other derivatives so i hope that answers your question darren but thats summarily how we see it darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc it does tony and i appreciate it im just curious as a followup and we expect it the same way as you see i think more volatility in regional ethane frac spreads we see a tremendous amount over the next  months to  months of arbitrage opportunity and when you start talking about the value chain incremental equity ngl barrels to be produced lets just say at a – the piceance you went to meeker and those plants how do you see the biggest regional margin capture opportunity is it conway to belvieu is it possibly belvieu to south or even west texas or maybe even more leverage referencing an earlier question on an arbitrage opportunity between the marcellus and utica in the gulf coast a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think its all of the above darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of kristina kazarian with deutsche bank kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc morning guys a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning kristina kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc so a quick followon i know you talked about the eagle ford and the haynesville but when i was thinking about the press release talking about green shoots of producer activity are there any other regions you guys want me to be thinking about where you maybe are seeing a little more than you were expecting at first anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp were seeing some acreage turning over in the rockies and were seeing signs that people that are players in the rockies are committed to the area in more ways than one so i would call some of the activity were seeing in the rockies a green shoot kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then a clarification on the ethane side as well i know youve gotten a lot of questions here but can you touch on a bit what you guys are seeing if any of the chem companies maybe like stepping up and wanting to lock in some ethane capacity on your system as theyre trying to secure supply for their facilities coming online any good updates on the margin there a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i dont know that – i tell you i dont see that weve seen a heck of a lot of that the us ethylene companies i mean i think they act like – they know that mont belvieu is a pretty liquid supply i guess one place where they definitely stepped up was on our aegis pipeline because the subscriptions on that pipeline if im not mistaken are all petrochemicals so they stepped up and subscribed to our aegis pipeline and its fully committed so i guess thats one example where they did step up kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc and anything on the margin more recently in terms of inbound requests a james teague  enterprise products partners lp not that i recall doug  no kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc all right thanks guys thats it for me operator your next question comes from the line of shneur gershuni with ubs shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc hi good morning guys a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning shneur shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc just had a couple of some follow ups to some of the earlier questions in particular the first two brians just with midlandtosealy and i know weve been beating this to a dead horse here but basically at what point do you need to decide in the construction process whether you go at  versus  is that a decision that you can make while construction is underway to actually upsize the pipe and then secondly the discussion about ethane potentially needing to come from other regions and so forth have you been looking at an atex expansion and is that something that we can hear about in relatively short order graham w bacon  enterprise products partners lp yes this is graham and regarding to midlandtosealy when you look at the design and layout of a pipeline you plan for the expansion and the layout so that youre not doing that after the fact so thats incorporated into our planning for that particular pipeline a james teague  enterprise products partners lp we could make the decision fairly quickly graham w bacon  enterprise products partners lp we can make the decision at any time a james teague  enterprise products partners lp okay in terms of your ethane out of the marcellus we could put projects in place to bring more ethane out of the marcellus shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc is it something that you are looking at doing or evaluating to do something in relatively short order or is that something that would take longer you would have to see the crackers come up and see where the market balance is at a james teague  enterprise products partners lp it would take  months from the time of decision shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc okay fair enough and there was a discussion i think it was with darren about ethylene and what would happen if the prices fell and so forth and maybe this is a question for tony to opine on but is there a scenario where the us would even if ethane was to go up would still continue to move forward because of the fact that their worldscale crackers and potentially close or force other crackers around the world to actually shut i was just wondering if you can talk about that dynamic as to when it really would impact production on the merchant side in the us a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yes there are advantages of gas to crude so if you believe that gas is going to sell at a low relationship to crude then ethane can go up and theyre still cost advantaged to nab the crackers in other parts of the world tony anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp completely agree unknown speaker and we publish our breakevens we think natural gas in the us is going to be extremely competitive for a long time it has been and we believe it will continue to be shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc okay fair enough and then one earnings question some pretty strong results in the crude segment any specific color on the strong performance i realize its sort of consistent with last year but its a pretty large step up from the prior quarter i was wondering if you can give us a little color as to why we saw that kind of strong performance there bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp hey shneur this is bryan some of that shift if you recall from last quarter was marktomarket movement so you had a kind of reversal of that and then you have improvement as well with respect to our efs midstream assets shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc cool great thank you very much guys really appreciate the color operator your next question comes from the line of jean ann salisbury with bernstein jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc morning just a couple about ngl exports so thirdparty reports suggest that overall gulf coast ngl exports had a really big rebound since the august lows but enterprises volumes have actually kind of gone in the other direction i know it doesnt impact earnings heavily because of the takeorpay but was wondering if you had any comment to why this could be do your competitors maybe just have different contract structures a james teague  enterprise products partners lp our competitors have a lot fewer contracts so i dont know if the ratios different we could have more cancellations and still have a lower ratio of cancellations to contracts joseph you got any thoughts unknown speaker yeah i mean weve seen the arb improve as weve gone through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue and volumes to reflect that i think were fairly happy and pretty proud of our third quarter export numbers actually jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay and then some of your takeorpay for lpg exports does begin to roll off in  and  are you actively remarketing that capacity and can it actually be remarketed as pgp or even other products a james teague  enterprise products partners lp the answer is we are always trying to – we try to go out as far as we can we dont wait for them to roll off so joseph continues to push forward and believe me he gets a lot of help around here on continuing to push for more contracts further out i think were realistic were not going to sleep at  to  but one of the advantages we have for us weve been doing this a long time and people recognize that we deliver on what we say well do and we continue to have discussions and we sign people up as far as the propylene yeah we put the capability to export propylene out at the ship channel because we believe in it and weve seen our cargos weve seen a steady growth in our propylene exports and surprising to me weve even seen some go to europe cory  unknown speaker yes thats correct a james teague  enterprise products partners lp so we sit back and say hey this is another opportunity youre going to have a lot of propylene in the us were going to have crackers i believe in other parts of the world that arent going to run it right so not run at all that typically were producing a lot of propylene and we think therell be a draw on what we have here jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc great thanks thats really helpful one last one is on that  or so of ethane that you have – and i get you started up and then start to sell it but is there any opportunity for a spot ethane market so to speak or is it more like you would sell it for a cracker that would take a couple of years to convert to be able to take it a james teague  enterprise products partners lp its pretty much point a to point b at this point in time im not saying that it wont develop into a traded commodity but its going to be a while all of our customers are petrochemical customers jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc great okay thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ted durbin with goldman sachs theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co thanks weve seen a lot of activity in the permian and actually on the delaware have you considered expanding midlandtosealy all the way out to the delaware a james teague  enterprise products partners lp no its a good question ted and we looked long and hard im looking over to brent  to help me here we looked long and hard at building upstream of midland and frankly theres a lot of pe projects that i guess could use leverage returns randy and we looked at the return we would have to accept and we said no thank you the reality is we really believed this we believe this is where cushing is concerned we believe that we do our jobs right on the gulf coast given our connectivity to every refinery in texas city houston beaumont and port arthur and given our access to water and given the amount of storage we have if we do our job right there were going to pull barrels through because the gulf coast is where a lot of these barrels want to be theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful and then on centennial i think you said you can move  a day can you talk to us just about how much volume you would need to get contracted up to make that project to go is it half of that and remind us if thats just propane or youre thinking about maybe an et mix there a james teague  enterprise products partners lp were thinking about a lot of things that were probably not going to talk about right now i got a partner that we have a high regard for a lot of respect for and weve been in discussions and were going to continue discussing a lot of ideas with marathon the one thing ill say is that marathon and enterprise given their position in the marcellus are very much aligned in what a solution might be theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay great and then if i can sneak one more in can you just give us a sense as youre looking ahead to  how the capex budget is lining up is it close to where we are with the  growth capital budget and then how do you think about distribution growth as you balance the need for financing the capex versus the halfpenny increase youve done for many quarters in a row bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp hi ted its bryan as far as  expectations were really in the early stages of our  budgeting process so id prefer to give you a qualified response than a wide estimate range so more to come on that but i dont think youll see any changes from what youve seen in the past with respect to distribution growth theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay thanks ill leave it at that bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp and the way weve financed ourselves theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co yep understood thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jeremy tonet with jpmorgan jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc good morning a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning jeremy jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc jim it seems like were facing a brave new world of pipeline buildout these days given the regulatory and environmental concerns out there i was just wondering if you could walk me through how you think about construction risk these days and how it plays into your business model a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think a pipe in the ground is going up in value dramatically because of a lot of whats going on today i think as you look at constructing new pipe you hope its in texas and louisiana and you probably put a little fudge factor in if its anywhere else jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc got you but at this point would it dissuade you from doing projects outside of kind of the areas you laid or are you just kind of risking it more a james teague  enterprise products partners lp were going to risk adjust the thing were probably going to take a hard look at our capital but i dont think its going to stop us from building where we want to build and where we need to build where people want services jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks and then just one more if i could i just want to followup on what you were talking about with the eagle ford as far as maybe land changing hands there and i was just thinking back with the pioneer acreage just using that as an example if that was to be sold to private equity or something like that would the contracts move with that would pioneer still be on the other side or how do you think about that type of scenario or that type of risk a james teague  enterprise products partners lp depends on the kind of deal that someone like a pioneer would do whether theyd wear it or the other person would assume it but the contracts stay intact and we continue to get paid and move the barrels jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thats it for me thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael blum with wells fargo michael blum  wells fargo securities llc hi thank you just had one question on the earnings for the quarter in the press release you talked about lower ngl volumes across midamerica seminole dixie a whole bunch of the smaller ngl pipelines can you talk about exactly whats driving that is that purely ethane or is there other factors thats sort of driving those yearoveryear declines in volume thanks a james teague  enterprise products partners lp ill try it and then throw it at bryan and anyone else who wants to but i think we saw a lot of ethane rejection by enterprise tug in the third quarter and if you think about it with our variable economics if were in rejection its pretty bad so i think that was a lot of it bryan john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp michael this is randy the other thing ill throw out too is we had dixie on hydro test on some of the segments there and that impacted some of the volumes on the dixie pipe michael blum  wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you guys operator your next question comes from nick raza with citigroup research nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you good morning guys just a quick couple of questions on centennial specifically do you think thered be any sort of regulatory hurdles in getting that project done assuming you lined up all the shippers and all the interest a james teague  enterprise products partners lp no i dont think itd be any regulatory hurdles that im aware of nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker okay so wed still be targeting sort of an month turnaround for that project that i think we had sort of loosely discussed in prior quarters or prior earnings calls a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think youre looking at  months nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker okay a james teague  enterprise products partners lp graham is that about right graham w bacon  enterprise products partners lp thats in the ballpark a james teague  enterprise products partners lp grahams going to say  months to  months graham w bacon  enterprise products partners lp you were reading my mind nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker fair enough what level of commitment would you guys need before you start moving forward with that project do you need to have  of the pipeline   all signed up and secure before you move forward a james teague  enterprise products partners lp theres a level – probably im not going to say but theres a level of commitment that wed want that equated to an accretive return that had upside nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker okay fair enough and the last question i had really was about the ethane exports you sort of commissioned the facility in september and the press release says that you had a  million loss was that just – are we to assume thats just a onetime scenario specifically i guess what im really asking is what level of ships do you guys need to sort of breakeven a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well let me put it like this this thing ramps – i dont think the first really big ship comes in until december joseph so this thing is going to ramp throughout next year if im not mistaken so its crawling right now before it walks but its just kind of a natural normal ramp that were going to go through over the next year before it really gets loaded is that right a year unknown speaker  nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker im sorry i didnt catch that a james teague  enterprise products partners lp this project ramps up over a year so our volume will be small until all of the contracts are starting up and i think theyll probably start up by the first of the year and then ramp throughout the year joseph unknown speaker that is correct yes nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker fair enough okay and last question guys in terms of the ethylene exports opportunity has there been sort of a movement forward on that if you can just give us a little bit of color a james teague  enterprise products partners lp weve gained some traction with some people i think well see i think some of these people recognize they need a – theyd like to have access to more markets i think theyre looking at asia and we feel pretty good about the project and personally i dont think this is going to go fast but i think it will go i think we have a location we can put it that as far as exporting ethylene we can probably build it cheaper than anyone else and you can imagine we do it at morgans point were sticking it right next to our ethane export so it kind of ties together nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker got you thanks guys thats all i had john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp jennifer this is randy well take one more question operator and our final question comes from john edwards with credit suisse john edwards  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah good morning everybody thanks for including me in the last question just in – jim you were talking in your preliminary comments in terms of uplift on ethane pricing its gone from  to  im just – this is probably a tony question just where do you think the next couple of years that price is going are you thinking  to  range or if thats wrong if you could correct our thinking a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah i dont look at it in terms of price i look at it in terms of margin john but ill let tony answer it anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp i think its very difficult to call price especially on something like ethane when youre looking at plants of this magnitude ramping up and the amount of rejection that we have today so its – thatd be a hard price to forecast were not as jim said thats a trade thats just not – its not what were about but with that said you know theres a fair amount of contango in the market today so the market is trying to price in in contango and give producers a price signal john edwards  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp out in the curve john edwards  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay so then youre thinking about it in terms of margins how – whats kind of your thought along

for second quarter   business wire enviva partners lp reports strong financial results for second quarter  august    am eastern daylight time bethesda mdbusiness wireenviva partners lp nyseeva the “partnership” or “we” today reported financial and operating results for the second quarter of  highlights for the second quarter of  generated net income of  million and adjusted ebitda of  million up from  million and  million respectively for the second quarter in  declared a quarterly distribution of  per unit a  percent increase from the distribution paid for the first quarter of  updated fullyear  guidance for net income to a range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda to a range of  million to  million excluding any impact of potential dropdowns or other acquisitions “our strong operating and financial performance through the second quarter coupled with our increased outlook for the remainder of  put us solidly on the path toward our previously announced fullyear distribution expectation of at least  per unit for  excluding the impact of any potential dropdowns or other acquisitions” said john keppler chairman and chief executive officer “in addition our market position enabled us to capitalize on dislocations in the market this quarter and optimize deliveries to our growing customer base” financial results for the second quarter of  we generated net revenue of  million an increase of  percent or  million from the corresponding quarter of  included in net revenue was product sales of  million on volume of  thousand metric tons of wood pellets product sales increased from the corresponding quarter of last year due to higher wood pellet sales volumes as a result of shipment timing partially offset by a higher percentage of “free on board” shipments which exclude shipping from revenue and cost of goods sold for the second quarter we generated net income of  million compared to  million for the corresponding quarter in  adjusted ebitda improved to  million in the second quarter of  a  percent increase compared to the corresponding period in  the increases in net income and adjusted ebitda were driven by higher wood pellet sales volumes under our longterm takeorpay contracts increased other revenue primarily derived from shipments purchased from and sold to third parties and lower general and administrative expenses partially offset by contract pricing mix the cost position of our delivered wood pellets primarily driven by plant utilization and raw material costs was consistent between periods the partnership’s distributable cash flow net of amounts attributable to incentive distribution rights increased from  million for the second quarter of  to  million for the second quarter of  resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of  times distribution as announced yesterday the board of directors of the partnership’s general partner declared a distribution of  per common and subordinated unit for the second quarter of  this distribution is  percent higher than the first quarter  distribution the second quarter distribution will be paid monday august   to unitholders of record as of the close of business monday august   outlook and guidance the partnership updated its fullyear  guidance the guidance amounts provided below do not include the impact of any potential acquisitions from the partnership’s sponsor or others the partnership now expects fullyear  net income to be in the range of  million to  million which reflects higher noncash compensation expense and noncash asset impairment and disposal charges than previously anticipated and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million which reflects the partnership’s betterthanexpected performance during the first half of  the partnership expects to incur maintenance capital expenditures of  million and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of  million in  as a result the partnership expects fullyear distributable cash flow to be in the range of  million to  million prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights paid to the general partner which reflects the expected improvement in fullyear adjusted ebitda for fullyear  we expect to distribute at least  per common and subordinated unit market and contracting update our sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the partnership we are fully contracted for  and our current capacity is matched with a portfolio of offtake contracts that has a weightedaverage remaining term of  years from july   including the partnership’s recently announced  year contract to supply  metric ton per year “mtpy” to lynemouth power limited but excluding potential sales under the partnership’s year contract to supply mgt power’s teesside renewable energy plant in the uk which continues to proceed towards financial close as we disclosed june   subsidiaries of graanul invest group “graanul” announced that they had purchased the shares of the company which owns the langerlo power station in genk belgium and intend to convert the power station from coal to biomass the langerlo power station has already received a subsidy from the flemish government to support the conversion is a systemrelevant production asset for the belgium power grid and its conversion is a critical component of belgium’s plan for meeting binding european union renewable energy consumption requirements we are in discussions with graanul in regards to potentially supplying a portion of the langerlo power station’s wood pellet fuel needs which are expected to be  million mtpy commencing in the second half of  we had previously entered into an offtake contract to supply wood pellets to an affiliate of german pellets gmbh that intended to use our product at the langerlo power station as a result of the sale to graanul however we believe it is unlikely that our contract counterparty will perform its obligations under this contract and although we intend to preserve all of our rights against our counterparty we do not expect our counterparty to take deliveries of wood pellets under it in the netherlands the government awarded several biomass cofiring dedicated biomass heat and combined heat and power projects a total of  billion euros in subsidies in the first of two rounds of applications for the  renewable incentive program biomass cofiring projects owned by rwe and engie were among the initial recipients the budget for the program had already been substantially increased to  billion euros for  from  billion euros in  and the budget for the second round of applications open from september through october  was increased further from  billion euros to  billion euros “in light of our contracting activity this quarter our sales book and production capacity are substantially balanced through early  and include contracts that extend out to  additional growth will be driven by demand continuing to materialize in our core european market and the developing asian market which we believe can be supplied costcompetitively from our assets in the southeastern us due to its advantaged fiber basket” said mr keppler “as the market leader we are excited about the opportunities to further extend our contracted position and diversify our customer base and the opportunities our sponsor may have to build substantial new fullycontracted production capacity that would add to its inventory of potential dropdown assets” sponsor activity construction of the  mtpy production plant in sampson county north carolina the “sampson plant” and deepwater marine terminal in wilmington north carolina the “wilmington terminal” is nearing completion our sponsor’s operations team expects to assume full operational control of the sampson plant later this month and for the first vessel to load at the wilmington terminal in october the partnership expects to have the opportunity to acquire the sampson plant along with our sponsor’s tenyear offtake contract with an affiliate of dong energy in late  and the wilmington terminal in  due to the relatedparty nature of such transactions the board of directors of the partnership’s general partner has formed a conflicts committee comprised solely of independent directors in anticipation of evaluating such opportunities in addition our sponsor has executed an agreement with the jackson county port authority granting our sponsor an option to build and operate a marine export terminal at the port of pascagoula mississippi conference call we will host a conference call with executive management related to our second quarter  results and to discuss our outlook guidance and a more detailed market update at  am eastern time on thursday august   information on how interested parties may listen to the conference call is available in the investor relations page

city florida to learn more about enviva partners lp please visit our website at wwwenvivabiomasscom nongaap financial measures we use adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance adjusted gross margin per metric ton we define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold we believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our offtake pricing to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense early retirement of debt obligations noncash unit compensation expense asset impairments and disposals and certain other items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks and research analysts to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure distributable cash flow we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount we use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare cash generating performance of the partnership from period to period and to compare the cash generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions if any that are expected to be paid to our unitholders we do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations our nongaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measures you should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our definitions of these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing their utility the
