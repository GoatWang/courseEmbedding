fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions nondiversification of investments means that more assets are potentially invested in fewer securities than if investments were diversified so risk is increased because each investment has a greater effect on performance the fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility investing in small and midcap companies may entail greater risk than largecap companies due to shorter operating histories less seasoned management or lower trading volumes if interest rates rise the value of convertible securities usually falls convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not pay interest or dividends and their market value may change based on their credit rating or the perception of their creditworthiness a convertible security also is subject to the same risks as common stock performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so
