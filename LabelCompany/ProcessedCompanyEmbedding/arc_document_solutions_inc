performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these measures are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income income from operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flows from operating investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity ebitda represents net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda margin is a nongaap measure calculated by dividing ebitda by net sales we have presented ebitda and related ratios because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity we believe investors may also find these measures meaningful given how our management makes use of them the following is a discussion of our use of these measures we use ebitda to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments our operating segments financial performance includes all of the operating activities except debt and taxation which are managed at the corporate level for us operating segments we use ebitda to compare the performance of our operating segments and to measure performance for determining consolidatedlevel compensation in addition we use ebitda to evaluate potential acquisitions and potential capital expenditures ebitda and related ratios have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are as follows they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures because of these limitations ebitda and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in business growth or to reduce our indebtedness we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda and related ratios only as supplements our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda over certain periods is an attempt to provide meaningful comparisons to our historical performance for our existing and future investors the unprecedented changes in our end markets over the past several years have required us to take measures that are unique in our history and specific to individual circumstances comparisons inclusive of these actions make normal financial and other performance patterns difficult to discern under a strict gaap presentation each nongaap presentation however is explained in detail in the reconciliation tables above specifically we have presented adjusted net income attributable to arc and adjusted earnings per share attributable to arc shareholders for the three and six months ended june   and  to reflect the exclusion of loss on extinguishment of debt goodwill impairment restructuring expense trade secret litigation costs and changes in the valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets and other discrete tax items this presentation facilitates a meaningful comparison of our operating results for the three and six months ended june   and  we believe these charges were the result of the then current macroeconomic environment our capital restructuring or other items which are not indicative of our actual operating performance we have presented adjusted ebitda in the three and six months ended june   and  to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt goodwill impairment trade secret litigation costs restructuring expense and stockbased compensation expense the adjustment of ebitda for these items is consistent with the definition of adjusted ebitda in our credit agreement therefore we believe this information is useful to investors in assessing our financial performance arc document solutions consolidated statements

interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebit margin is a nongaap measure calculated by dividing ebit by net sales ebitda margin is a nongaap measure calculated by dividing ebitda by net sales we have presented ebit ebitda and related ratios because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity we believe investors may also find these measures meaningful given how our management makes use of them the following is a discussion of our use of these measures we use ebit and ebitda to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments our operating segments financial performance includes all of the operating activities except debt and taxation which are managed at the corporate level for us operating segments as a result we believe ebit is the best measure of operating segment profitability and the most useful metric by which to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments we use ebitda to measure performance for determining consolidatedlevel compensation in addition we use ebit and ebitda to evaluate potential acquisitions and potential capital expenditures ebit ebitda and related ratios have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are as follows they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures because of these limitations ebit ebitda and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in business growth or to reduce our indebtedness we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebit ebitda and related ratios only as supplements our presentation of adjusted net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted cash flows from operations over certain periods is an attempt to provide meaningful comparisons to our historical performance for our existing and future investors the unprecedented changes in our end markets over the past several years have required us to take measures that are unique in our history and specific to individual circumstances comparisons inclusive of these actions make normal financial and other performance patterns difficult to discern under a strict gaap presentation each nongaap presentation however is explained in detail in the reconciliation tables above for more information see our  annual report on form k specifically we have presented adjusted net income attributable to arc and adjusted earnings per share attributable to arc shareholders for the three and twelve months ended december   and  to reflect the exclusion of loss on extinguishment of debt restructuring expense trade secret litigation costs and changes in the valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets and other discrete tax items we have presented adjusted cash flows from operating activities for the three and twelve months ended december   and  to reflect the exclusion of cash payments related to trade secret litigation costs and cash payments related to restructuring expenses this presentation facilitates a meaningful comparison of our operating results for the three and twelve months ended december   and  we believe these charges were the result of the current macroeconomic environment our capital restructuring or other items which are not indicative of our actual operating performance we have presented adjusted ebitda for the three and twelve months ended december   and  to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt trade secret litigation costs stockbased compensation expense and restructuring expense the adjustment of ebitda for these items

to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and
