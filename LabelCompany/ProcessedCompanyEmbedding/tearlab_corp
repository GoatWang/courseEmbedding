tearlab add datato yourinsights contact us tearlab is an objective and quantitative pointofcare diagnostic test that provides precise and predictive information  the tearlab osmolarity system is intended to measure the osmolarity of human tears to aid in the diagnosis of dry eye disease in patients suspected of having dry eye disease in conjunction with other methods of clinical evaluation tearlab is for professional in vitro diagnostic use only cme symposia optimizing ocular surface diagnosis available on eyeworld education hub httpbitlyaokud   osmolarity what the numbers reveal tearlab adds data to a doctors insight by guiding the diagnosis and management of the ocular surface abnormal osmolarity is defined by   an elevated reading  mosml indicating loss of homeostasis†   or when the intereye difference is  mosml indicating instability of the tear film† osmolarity is an important biomarker of ocular surface health   how it works the tearlab osmolarity test card in conjunction with the tearlab osmolarity system provides a quick and simple method for determining tear osmolarity using nanoliter nl volumes of tear fluid collected directly from the eyelid margin the test card is held by the osmolarity test pen for safe collection the tearlab osmolarity test utilizes a temperaturecorrected impedance measurement to provide an indirect assessment of osmolarity after applying a lotspecific calibration curve osmolarity is calculated and displayed as a quantitative numerical value to learn how to perform the test see our training videos how to perform the testpatient information   precise and predictive results  at the pointofcare space precise more precise than other universally accepted pointofcare tests such as cholesterol and glucose the science of tearlab is predictive tearlab has a positive predictive value of  positive predictive value is the probability that subjects with a positive test truly have the disease variability is the hallmark of
