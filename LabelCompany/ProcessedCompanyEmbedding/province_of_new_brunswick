brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests new brunswick changed from more than twothirds rural before  to predominantly urban by  education and health care were poorly funded and in the s and s the rates of illiteracy and infant mortality were among the highest in canada during the period –  of new brunswicks small farms disappeared as the agroindustry took root the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers who lived in the south of the province the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the ambitious equal opportunity plan in which education rural road maintenance and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province county councils were abolished and the rural areas came under direct provincial jurisdiction the  official languages act made french an official language geographyedit main article geography

brunswickers making up roughly twothirds of the population and the acadien or francophone new brunswicker population representing over  of the population people whose mother tongue is an officially recognized first nations languages or nonofficial language together make up about  of new brunswickers as a comparison the minority language communities of ontario and quebec francoontarians and anglophone quebeckers respectively make up less than  of those provinces populations with both official language communities so strongly represented new brunswick is home to both french and english language hospitals and healthcare networks school systems universities and media the province also has a relatively high proportion of people who state that they can speak both official languages with about  people or  of the population reporting the ability to speak both english and french though francophones make up twothirds of those who are bilingual language policy remains a perennial issue in new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and freedoms has a number of new brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of new brunswick in each section relating to language ex section  has two paragraphs the first regarding bilingual publication of the canadian parliaments work and laws the second specifying that new brunswicks legislature will publish its work in both french and english of particular interest is article  which declares that the french and english speaking communities of new brunswick have equal rights and privileges including community specific educational and cultural institutions this specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific

different from those of other canadian provinces the lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province in

fredericton see also education in new brunswick and list of schools in new brunswick public education in the province is administered by the department of education a department of the government of new brunswick according to a forest of legislation because of segmentation by age and purpose private education apprenticeships and occupational training in the province are also strictly regulated to the extent that it constitutes a provincial offence to offer courses with no licence new brunswick has a comprehensive parallel system of anglophone and francophone public schools providing education to both the primary and secondary levels these schools are segregated by government decree the english system developed out of a mixture of the british and american systems reflecting the loyalist background of so many early settlers there are also secular and religious private schools in the province the new brunswick community college system has campuses in all regions of the province although they are legislated separately by official language this comprehensive trade school system offers roughly parallel programs in various campuses anglophone students from the northern part of the province must travel south to obtain education whereas francophone students have no courses offered in the southwest each campus however tends to have areas of concentration to allow for specialization there are also a number of private colleges for specialized training in the province such as the moncton flight college one of the top pilottraining academies in canada there are four

culture was aboriginal in flavour influenced by the native populations who made their home along the coast and riverbanks until the arrival of frenchspeaking in the early th century and englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of glooscap began to emerge as described by the political historian arthur doyle an invisible line separated the two founding european cultures beginning on the eastern outskirts of moncton and running diagonally across the province northwest towards grand falls franconew brunswick acadie lay to the northeast of this divide and anglonew brunswick lay to the southwest doyles characterization was made not long after government reforms by former premier louis j robichaud had significantly improved the status of frenchspeaking acadians within the province and initiated their journey towards cultural recognition and equality with their englishspeaking counterparts the capitol theatre in moncton early new brunswick was influenced by its colonial ties to france england scotland and ireland as well as by its geographical proximity to new england and the arrival of about  loyalists in  as local society was founded in forestry and seaborne endeavours a tradition of lumber camp songs and sea shanties prevailed acadian cloggers and irish and scots step dancers competed at festivals to expressive fiddle and accordion music the art of storytelling wellknown to the native populations passed on to the early settlers and poetry—whether put to music or not—was a common form of commemorating shared events as the voice of a masterful poet or soulful musician easily conquered the provinces language barriers one of the greatest celebrated holidays in new brunswick is canada day this is because new brunswick was one of the first four provinces of confederation joining on july   another holiday that is of great importance is new brunswick day which is on the first monday of august and has been celebrated annually since  this statutory holiday gives the people of new brunswick an opportunity to celebrate their provincess history culture natural beauty and community relations families can enjoy large meals entertainment and other fun activities together other cultural expressions were found in family gatherings and the church both french and english cultures saw a long and early influence of ecclesiastical architecture with western european and american influences dominating rather than a particular vernacular sense poets produced the first important literary contributions in the province cousins bliss carman and sir charles gd roberts found inspiration in the landscape as would later writers as well in painting individual artists such as anthony flower worked in obscurity either through design or neglect while others such as edward mitchell bannister left the province before ever developing a local influence few thcentury artists emerged but those who did often benefited from fine arts training at mount allison university in sackville which began offering classes in  the program came into its own under john a hammond who served from  to  alex colville and lawren harris later studied and taught art there and both christopher pratt and mary pratt were trained at mount allison the university’s art gallery – which opened in  and is named for its patron john owens of saint john – is canada’s oldest in frenchspeaking new brunswick it would not be until the s that a comparable institution was founded the université de moncton then a cultural renaissance occurred under the influence of acadian historians and such teachers as claude roussel and through coffeehouses music and protest an outpouring of acadian art literature and music has pressed on unabated since that time popular exponents of modern acadian literature and music

proximity to the united states affects the everyday life of people that live close to the line new brunswick shares more border crossings with the us state of maine than any other provincestate share in north america furthermore the wellknown maritime dialect so recognizable in nova scotia and pei becomes watered down the further west and north you move in the province while some areas like saint john strongly share in the maritime cultural experience a number of population centres in new brunswick have more in common with communities in maine than they do with halifax or charlottetown new

brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island

separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard

constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry

the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the

new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and

hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of

capital greater moncton currently the largest metropolitan cma area and the most populous city and the port city of saint john which was the first incorporated city in canada and largest in the province for  years until citation needed in the canada  census statistics canada estimated the provincial population to have been  down very slightly from  in  on an area of almost  km the majority of the population is englishspeaking of anglo and celtic heritage but there is also a large francophone minority  chiefly of acadian origin it was created as a result of the partitioning of the british colony of nova scotia in  and was originally named new ireland with the capital to be in saint john the name was soon replaced with new brunswick by king george iii the provincial flag

brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests new brunswick changed from more than twothirds rural before  to predominantly urban by  education and health care were poorly funded and in the s and s the rates of illiteracy and infant mortality were among the highest in canada during the period –  of new brunswicks small farms disappeared as the agroindustry took root the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers who lived in the south of the province the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the ambitious equal opportunity plan in which education rural road maintenance and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province county councils were abolished and the rural areas came under direct provincial jurisdiction the  official languages act made french an official language geographyedit main article geography of new brunswick see also geology of new brunswick map of the province showing major cities new brunswick is bordered on the north by quebecs gaspé peninsula and by chaleur bay the eastern boundary is formed by the gulf of saint lawrence and northumberland strait the southeast corner of the province is connected to the nova scotia peninsula by the narrow isthmus of chignecto the south of the province is bounded by the bay of fundy coast which with a rise of  m  ft has amongst the highest tides in the world the us state of maine forms the western boundary new brunswick differs from the other maritime provinces physiographically climatologically and ethnoculturally both nova scotia and prince edward island are either surrounded by or are almost completely surrounded by water oceanic effects therefore tend to define their climate economy and culture on the other hand new brunswick although having a significant seacoast is sheltered from the atlantic ocean proper and has a large interior that is removed from oceanic influences as a result the climate tends to be more continental in character than maritime the major river systems of the province include the st croix river saint john river kennebecasis river petitcodiac river magaguadavic river miramichi river nepisiguit river and the restigouche river although smaller the bouctouche river richibucto river and kouchibouguac river are also important the settlement patterns and the economy of new brunswick are based more on the provinces river systems than its seacoasts because of this new brunswicks population centres tend to be less centralized than in prince edward island and nova scotia fredericton saint john and moncton all sit on rivers that have played a significant role in their economic

recognized first nations languages or nonofficial language together make up about  of new brunswickers as a comparison the minority language communities of ontario and quebec francoontarians and

language hospitals and healthcare networks school systems universities and media the province also has a relatively high proportion of people who state that they can speak both official languages with about  people or  of the population reporting the ability to speak both english and french though francophones make up twothirds of those who are bilingual language policy remains a perennial issue in new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and freedoms has a number of new brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of new brunswick in each section relating to language ex section  has two paragraphs the first regarding bilingual publication of the canadian parliaments work and laws the second specifying that new brunswicks legislature will publish its work in both french and english of particular interest is article  which declares that the french and english speaking communities of new brunswick have equal rights and privileges including community specific educational and cultural institutions this specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific

to time other parties such as the confederation of regions party have held seats in the legislature but only on the strength of a strong protest vote the dynamics of new brunswick politics are different from those of other canadian provinces the lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province in

culture was aboriginal in flavour influenced by the native populations who made their home along the coast and riverbanks until the arrival of frenchspeaking in the early th century and englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of glooscap began to emerge as described by the political historian arthur doyle an invisible line separated the two founding european cultures beginning on the eastern outskirts of moncton and running diagonally across the province northwest towards grand falls franconew brunswick acadie lay to the northeast of this divide and anglonew brunswick lay to the southwest doyles characterization was made not long after government reforms by former premier louis j robichaud had significantly improved the status of frenchspeaking acadians within the province and initiated their journey towards cultural recognition and equality with their englishspeaking counterparts the capitol theatre in moncton early new brunswick was influenced by its colonial ties to france england scotland and ireland as well

landscape as would later writers as well in painting individual artists such as anthony flower worked in obscurity either through design or neglect while others such as edward mitchell bannister left

capital greater moncton currently the largest metropolitan cma area and the most populous city and the port city of saint john which was the first incorporated city in canada and largest in the province for  years until citation needed in the canada  census statistics canada estimated the provincial population to have been  down very slightly from  in  on an area of almost  km the majority of the population is englishspeaking of anglo and celtic heritage but there is also a large francophone minority  chiefly of acadian origin it was created as a result of the partitioning of the british colony of nova scotia in  and was originally named new ireland with the capital to be in saint john the name was soon replaced with new brunswick by king george iii the provincial flag

brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests new brunswick changed from more than twothirds rural before  to predominantly urban by  education and health care were poorly funded and in the s and s the rates of illiteracy and infant mortality were among the highest in canada during the period –  of new brunswicks small farms disappeared as the agroindustry took root the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers who lived in the south of the province the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the ambitious equal opportunity plan in which education rural road maintenance and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province county councils were abolished and the rural areas came under direct provincial jurisdiction the  official languages act made french an official language geographyedit main article geography

other maritime provinces physiographically climatologically and ethnoculturally both nova scotia and prince edward island are either surrounded by or are almost completely surrounded by water oceanic effects therefore tend to define their climate economy and culture on the other hand new brunswick although having a significant seacoast is sheltered from the atlantic ocean proper and has a large interior that is removed from oceanic influences as a result the climate tends to be more continental in character than maritime the major river systems of the province include the st croix river saint john river kennebecasis river petitcodiac river magaguadavic river miramichi river nepisiguit river and the restigouche river although smaller the bouctouche river richibucto river and kouchibouguac river are also important the settlement patterns and the economy of new brunswick are based more on the provinces river systems than its seacoasts because of this new brunswicks

acadians who were deported to louisiana are often referred to as cajuns in english much of the english canadian population of new brunswick is descended from loyalists who fled the american revolution

       languagesedit new brunswick is canadas only officially bilingual province and it is the only province where both official language communities are heavily represented with anglophone new brunswickers making up roughly twothirds of the population and the acadien or francophone new brunswicker population representing over  of the population people whose mother tongue is an officially recognized first nations languages or nonofficial language together make up about  of new brunswickers as a comparison the minority language communities of ontario and quebec francoontarians and anglophone quebeckers respectively make up less than  of those provinces populations with both official language communities so strongly represented new brunswick is home to both french and english language hospitals and healthcare networks school systems universities and media the province also has a relatively high proportion of people who state that they can speak both official languages with about  people or  of the population reporting the ability to speak both english and french though francophones make up twothirds of those who are bilingual language policy remains a perennial issue in new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and freedoms has a number of new brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of new brunswick in each section relating to language ex section  has two paragraphs the first regarding bilingual publication of the canadian parliaments work and laws the second specifying that new brunswicks legislature will publish its work in both french and english of particular interest is article  which declares that the french and english speaking communities of new brunswick have equal rights and privileges including community specific educational and cultural institutions this specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific

culture was aboriginal in flavour influenced by the native populations who made their home along the coast and riverbanks until the arrival of frenchspeaking in the early th century and englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of glooscap began to emerge as described by the political historian arthur doyle an invisible line separated the two founding european cultures beginning on the eastern outskirts of moncton and running diagonally across the province northwest towards grand falls franconew brunswick acadie lay to the northeast of this divide and anglonew brunswick lay to the southwest doyles characterization was made not long after government reforms by former premier louis j robichaud had significantly improved the status of frenchspeaking acadians within the province and initiated their journey towards cultural recognition and equality with their englishspeaking counterparts the capitol theatre in moncton early new brunswick was influenced by its colonial ties to france england scotland and ireland as well as by its geographical proximity to new england and the arrival of about  loyalists in  as local society was founded in forestry and seaborne endeavours a tradition of lumber camp songs and sea shanties prevailed acadian cloggers and irish and scots step dancers competed at festivals to expressive fiddle and accordion music the art of storytelling wellknown to the native populations passed

landscape as would later writers as well in painting individual artists such as anthony flower worked in obscurity either through design or neglect while others such as edward mitchell bannister left the province before ever developing a local influence few thcentury artists emerged but those who did often benefited from fine arts training at mount allison university in sackville which began

the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests new brunswick changed from more than twothirds rural before  to predominantly urban by  education and health care were poorly funded and in the s and s the rates of illiteracy and infant mortality were among the highest in canada during the period –  of new brunswicks small farms disappeared as the agroindustry took root the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers who lived in the south of the province the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the ambitious equal opportunity plan in which education rural road maintenance and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province county councils were abolished and the rural areas came under direct provincial jurisdiction the  official languages act made french an official language geographyedit main article geography

language hospitals and healthcare networks school systems universities and media the province also has a relatively high proportion of people who state that they can speak both official languages with about  people or  of the population reporting the ability to speak both english and french though francophones make up twothirds of those who are bilingual language policy remains a perennial issue in new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and freedoms has a number of new brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of new brunswick in each section relating to language ex section  has two paragraphs the first regarding bilingual

declares that the french and english speaking communities of new brunswick have equal rights and privileges including community specific educational and cultural institutions this specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific

different from those of other canadian provinces the lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province in

new brunswick according to a forest of legislation because of segmentation by age and purpose private education apprenticeships and occupational training in the province are also strictly regulated to the extent that it constitutes a provincial offence to offer courses with no licence new brunswick has a comprehensive parallel system of anglophone and francophone public schools providing education to both the primary and secondary levels these schools are segregated by government decree the english system developed out of a mixture of the british and american systems reflecting the loyalist background of so many early settlers there are also secular and religious private schools in the province the new brunswick community college system has campuses in all regions of the province although they are legislated separately by official language this comprehensive trade school system offers roughly parallel programs in various campuses anglophone students from the northern part of the province must travel south to obtain education whereas francophone students have no courses offered in the southwest each campus however tends to have areas of concentration to allow for specialization there are also a number of private colleges for specialized training in the province such as the moncton flight college one of the top pilottraining academies in canada there are four

culture was aboriginal in flavour influenced by the native populations who made their home along the coast and riverbanks until the arrival of frenchspeaking in the early th century and englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of glooscap began to emerge as described by the political historian arthur doyle an invisible line separated the two founding european cultures beginning on the eastern outskirts of moncton and running diagonally across the province northwest towards grand falls franconew brunswick acadie lay to the northeast of this divide and anglonew brunswick lay to the southwest doyles characterization was made not long after government reforms by former premier louis j robichaud had significantly improved the status of frenchspeaking acadians within the province and initiated their journey towards cultural recognition and equality with their englishspeaking counterparts the capitol theatre in moncton early new brunswick was influenced by its colonial ties to france england scotland and ireland as well as by its geographical proximity to new england and the arrival of about  loyalists in  as local society was founded in forestry and seaborne endeavours a tradition of lumber camp songs and sea shanties prevailed acadian cloggers and irish and scots step dancers competed at festivals to expressive fiddle and accordion music the art of storytelling wellknown to the native populations passed on to the early settlers and poetry—whether put to music or not—was a common form of commemorating shared events as the voice of a masterful poet or soulful musician easily conquered the provinces language barriers one of the greatest celebrated holidays in new brunswick is canada day this is because new brunswick was one of the first four provinces of confederation joining on july   another holiday that is of great importance is new brunswick day which is on the first monday of august and has been celebrated annually since  this statutory holiday gives the people of new brunswick an opportunity to celebrate their provincess history culture natural beauty and community relations families can enjoy large meals entertainment and other fun activities together other cultural expressions were found in family gatherings and the church both french and english cultures saw a long and early influence of ecclesiastical architecture with western european and american influences dominating rather than a particular vernacular sense poets produced the first important literary contributions in the province cousins bliss carman and sir charles gd roberts found inspiration in the landscape as would later writers as well in painting individual artists such as anthony flower worked in obscurity either through design or neglect while others such as edward mitchell bannister left the province before ever developing a local influence few thcentury artists emerged but those who did often benefited from fine arts training at mount allison university in sackville which began offering classes in  the program came into its own under john a hammond who served from  to  alex colville and lawren harris later studied and taught art there and both christopher pratt and mary pratt were trained at mount allison the university’s art gallery – which opened in  and is named for its patron john owens of saint john – is canada’s oldest in frenchspeaking new brunswick it would not be until the s that a comparable institution was founded the université de moncton then a cultural renaissance occurred under the influence of acadian historians and such teachers as claude roussel and through coffeehouses music and protest an outpouring of acadian art literature and music has pressed on unabated since that time popular exponents of modern acadian literature and music

in a number of ways because of the provincess sizeable french speaking population frenchcanadian culture specifically acadian permeates many parts of new brunswick society likewise new brunswicks proximity to the united states affects the everyday life of people that live close to the line new brunswick shares more border crossings with the us state of maine than any other provincestate share in north america furthermore the wellknown maritime dialect so recognizable in nova scotia and pei becomes watered down the further west and north you move in the province while some areas like saint john strongly share in the maritime cultural experience a number of population centres in new brunswick have more in common with communities in maine than they do with halifax or charlottetown new brunswick has been coined by many as canadas drivethru province while this title is used in jest there is truth behind the fact that the sheer distances between major population centres in new

brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard

constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry

the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the

new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and

englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of

capital greater moncton currently the largest metropolitan cma area and the most populous city and the port city of saint john which was the first incorporated city in canada and largest in the province for  years until citation needed in the canada  census statistics canada estimated the provincial population to have been  down very slightly from  in  on an area of almost  km the majority of the population is englishspeaking of anglo and celtic heritage but there is also a large francophone minority  chiefly of acadian origin it was created as a result of the partitioning of the british colony of nova scotia in  and was originally named new ireland with the capital to be in saint john the name was soon replaced with new brunswick by king george iii the provincial flag

brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests new brunswick changed from more than twothirds rural before  to predominantly urban by  education and health care were poorly funded and in the s and s the rates of illiteracy and infant mortality were among the highest in canada during the period –  of new brunswicks small farms disappeared as the agroindustry took root the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers who lived in the south of the province the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the ambitious equal opportunity plan in which education rural road maintenance and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province county councils were abolished and the rural areas came under direct provincial jurisdiction the  official languages act made french an official language geographyedit main article geography of new brunswick see also geology of new brunswick map of the province showing major cities new brunswick is bordered on the north by quebecs gaspé peninsula and by chaleur bay the eastern boundary is formed by the gulf of saint lawrence and northumberland strait the southeast corner of the province is connected to the nova scotia peninsula by the narrow isthmus of chignecto the south of the province is bounded by the bay of fundy coast which with a rise of  m  ft has amongst the highest tides in the world the us state of maine forms the western boundary new brunswick differs from the other maritime provinces physiographically climatologically and ethnoculturally both nova scotia and prince edward island are either surrounded by or are almost completely surrounded by water oceanic effects therefore tend to define their climate economy and culture on the other hand new brunswick although having a significant seacoast is sheltered from the atlantic ocean proper and has a large interior that is removed from oceanic influences as a result the climate tends to be more continental in character than maritime the major river systems of the province include the st croix river saint john river kennebecasis river petitcodiac river magaguadavic river miramichi river nepisiguit river and the restigouche river although smaller the bouctouche river richibucto river and kouchibouguac river are also important the settlement patterns and the economy of new brunswick are based more on the provinces river systems than its seacoasts because of this new brunswicks population centres tend to be less centralized than in prince edward island and nova scotia fredericton saint john and moncton all sit on rivers that have played a significant role in their economic history northern new brunswick is dominated by the appalachian mountains within the eastern canadian forests ecoregion with the northwestern part of the province consisting of the remote and rugged

about  people or  of the population reporting the ability to speak both english and french though francophones make up twothirds of those who are bilingual language policy remains a perennial issue in new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and freedoms has a number of new brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of new brunswick in each section relating to language ex section  has two paragraphs the first regarding bilingual

declares that the french and english speaking communities of new brunswick have equal rights and privileges including community specific educational and cultural institutions this specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific

to time other parties such as the confederation of regions party have held seats in the legislature but only on the strength of a strong protest vote the dynamics of new brunswick politics are different from those of other canadian provinces the lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province in

culture was aboriginal in flavour influenced by the native populations who made their home along the coast and riverbanks until the arrival of frenchspeaking in the early th century and englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of glooscap began to emerge as described by the political historian arthur doyle an invisible line separated the two founding european cultures beginning on the eastern outskirts of moncton and running diagonally across the province northwest towards grand falls franconew brunswick acadie lay to the northeast of this divide and anglonew brunswick lay to the southwest doyles characterization was made not long after government reforms by former premier louis j robichaud had significantly improved the status of frenchspeaking acadians within the province and initiated their journey towards cultural recognition and equality with their englishspeaking counterparts the capitol theatre in moncton early new brunswick was influenced by its colonial ties to france england scotland and ireland as well

acadian settlers augmented by french canadians from quebec and it is concentrated in the northern and eastern counties descendants of the province’s first inhabitants the indians first nations remain in small numbers on federally administered reserves reservations along the east coast or in the st john valley or they have integrated into neighbouring communities there are several thousand blacks largely descendants of loyalist slaves in the province as well in the th century small contingents of eastern european dutch german italian and asian immigrants added a multicultural dimension mostly in the larger urban areas roman catholics outnumber protestants who are mostly of the baptist united church of canada anglican pentecostal and presbyterian denominationssettlement patternssettlement began on the coastline and rivers where early settlers followed fishing and agricultural pursuits small towns tended to spring up along the river systems which supported sawmills and general stores saint john an allseason ocean port situated at the mouth of the st john river has been the largest city from earliest times moncton in the southeast emerged in the late th century as a railroad and distribution centre fredericton the capital and an administrative educational and commercial city is near the geographic centre of the province miramichi located on the river of the same name is an industrial city that produces paper and other forest products bathurst campbellton and edmundston small bilingual cities in the north with frenchspeaking majorities all developed on the basis of the pulp and paper industry in the s the canadian armed forces established base gagetown covering several thousand acres between fredericton and saint john and they built the modern town of oromocto for army personneldemographic trendspopulation growth was relatively slight in the early st century many young adults drawn by the employment opportunities and higher salaries of central canadian cities and western oil fields continued to migrate out of new brunswick within the province cities became the employment centres although the common practice of commuting from rural homes or from suburban areas prevented significant urban population growtheconomynew brunswick has a resourcebased economy dependent largely on forestry mining and fishing tourism agriculture smallscale manufacturing and a growing service sector provide balance and diversity real economic growth tends to be at or above the regional average for the atlantic provinces region reflecting expansion in oil refining telecommunications computer software development and natural gas distributionagriculture forestry and fishingonly about onefifth of the landmass of the province is suitable for agriculture and less than onethird of that is actually under cultivation floodplains which represent only a tiny percentage of the provincial landmass possess the richest soils they are suitable for truck farming which is concentrated near the southern cities notably in the lower st john river valley small family farms remain the most numerous type among the province’s approximately  farms but their numbers are dwindling and thousands of acres of previously cultivated land are returning to forest the largest farms specialize in the leading cash crops dairy products and potatoes the former concentrated in southcentral and southeastern areas and the latter in the upper st john valley both benefit from largescale foodprocessing plants in their respective areas poultry cattle hogs eggs maple products and blueberries represent other significant commodities provincial policy focuses on soil conservation and new product developmentabout fourfifths of the provincial landmass is forested and the forest industry is the province’s largest pulp and paper production represents the industry’s largest single component several cities and towns mostly in the north depend on large pulp and paper mills as their major employers sawmills are widespread as well and other forest products include lumber plywood chipboard fuel and christmas trees the forests also provide a wide range of jobs in related fields about half of the forested land is in the public domain although large corporate users are responsible for reforestation and management of assigned districts wood supply and fluctuating foreign markets emerged as major challenges in the early st centurythe fishing and fishprocessing industry continues to be important in the provincial economy it employs numerous workers in the main fishing areas including the bay of fundy the northumberland strait and the gulf of st lawrence lobster crab scallops herring cod mackerel and a variety of other north atlantic species make up the bulk of the catch the industry is a volatile one subject to seasonal and longerterm shifts in fish stocks foreign competition weather conditions and credit availability it has thus become highly dependent on

slightly higher than the rates in canada as a whole nevertheless rates of employment showed improvement over past decades trends in the previous century had kept unemployment rates fairly high a lack of diversification in the resourcebased economy high transportation costs and a decline in manufacturing had reduced opportunities and contributed to significant outmigrationthe province derives the overwhelming majority of its revenue from various taxes these include corporate and personal income taxes capital taxes a valueadded sales tax a real property tax gasoline and fuel taxes and a tobacco

its present boundariesseal of new brunswick canencyclopædia britannica inccoat of arms of new brunswick canencyclopædia britannica incthe first englishspeaking settlers from new england moved into the st john river valley and founded the town of maugerville in  but it was the influx of some  loyalist refugees from the american revolution mostly from new york and its vicinity that created the pressure for separate provincehood the loyalist city of saint john became canada’s first incorporated city in  and smaller settlements were established in the st john and st croix valleysafter early problems of adjustment the loyalist communities of new brunswick began to prosper underlying the improved economy was the british decision in  to grant preferential tariffs to the timber resources of its north american colonies a move made when napoleon i’s blockade cut off the baltic supply of shipbuilding materials to the british for new brunswick with its limited agricultural lands but widespread forests this historical incident provided an opportunity that helped usher in the socalled age of wood wind and water an era of prosperity based on timber exports and shipbuilding the reciprocity treaty with the united states in  and the demand created by the american civil war further stimulated tradepolitically the province moved slowly toward a more democratic system government in the first generation was dominated by a loyalist elite supported by british imperial authority responsible home government government in which the executive branch is drawn from and answerable to an elected legislative branch was granted by britain in  political parties organized largely along ethnic and religious lines and prompted by the prohibition issue emerged in the s with its economic success and political independence new brunswick entered confederation with canada in  somewhat reluctantlyconfederation however coincided with the collapse of the age of wooden ships and new brunswickers found themselves scrambling over the next  years to rebuild their economy on a new foundation railroads and national tariffs helped in the development of manufacturing such as that of cotton textiles but the province suffered from the pull of the urban growth areas of quebec and ontario by the th century new brunswick required federally subsidized freight rates and it argued along with other maritime provinces for federal financial assistance which after the mids it obtainedmeanwhile a modern party system emerged in which until the s the old elements of ethnicity and religion continued to be significant liberals and progressive conservatives alternated in government at fairly regular intervals in the midth century both parties sought economic development based on new electrical power facilities in the s a liberal equal opportunity program revolutionized the delivery of health justice education and social services by abolishing counties as administrative units and by centralizing funding and administration at the provincial level unique in canada the system met strong early resistance but it continued under the subsequent conservative government and won acceptance especially in lessprosperous rural and northern areas as a means of equalizing services in all parts of the province since the late s both liberal and conservative governments have emphasized fiscal restraint balanced budgets the restructuring of public services and a reduction in dependence on federal financial support in the s and early st century governments continued to pursue economic selfsufficiencynew brunswickers think of their province with its two languages and cultures as a microcosm of canada moreover the province’s small size tends to promote support for canadian federalism among members of both linguistic groups even at the beginning of the st century the province retained qualities of its rural and smalltown paststephen e patterson additional media

st john river valley and founded the town of maugerville in  but it was the influx of some  loyalist refugees from the american revolution mostly from new york and its vicinity that created the pressure for separate provincehood the loyalist city of saint john became canada’s first incorporated city in  and smaller settlements were established in the st john and st croix valleysafter early problems of adjustment the loyalist communities of new brunswick began to prosper underlying the improved economy was the british decision in  to grant preferential tariffs to the timber resources of its north american colonies a move made when napoleon i’s blockade cut off the baltic supply of shipbuilding materials to the british for new brunswick with its limited agricultural lands but widespread forests this historical incident provided an opportunity that helped usher in the socalled age of wood wind and water an era of prosperity based on timber exports and shipbuilding the reciprocity treaty with the united states in  and the demand created by the american civil war further stimulated tradepolitically the province moved slowly toward a more democratic system government in the first generation was dominated by a loyalist elite supported by british imperial authority responsible home government government in which the executive branch is drawn from and answerable to an elected legislative branch was granted by britain in  political parties organized largely along ethnic and religious lines and prompted by the prohibition issue emerged in the s with its economic success and political independence new brunswick entered confederation with canada in  somewhat reluctantlyconfederation however coincided with the collapse of the age of wooden ships and new brunswickers found themselves scrambling over the next  years to rebuild their economy on a new foundation railroads and national tariffs helped in the development of manufacturing such as that of cotton textiles but the province suffered from the pull of the urban growth areas of quebec and ontario by the th century new brunswick required federally subsidized freight rates and it argued along with other maritime provinces for federal financial assistance which after the mids it obtainedmeanwhile a modern party system emerged in which until the s the old elements of ethnicity and religion continued to be significant liberals and progressive conservatives alternated in government at fairly regular intervals in the midth century both parties sought economic development based on new electrical power facilities in the s a liberal equal opportunity program revolutionized the delivery of health justice education and social services by abolishing counties as administrative units and by centralizing funding and administration at the provincial level unique in canada the system met strong early resistance but it continued under the subsequent conservative government and won acceptance especially in lessprosperous rural and northern areas as a means of equalizing services in all parts of the province since the late s both liberal and conservative governments have emphasized fiscal restraint balanced budgets the restructuring of public services and a reduction in dependence on federal financial support in the s and early st century governments continued to pursue economic selfsufficiencynew brunswickers think of their province with its two languages and cultures as a microcosm of canada moreover the province’s small size tends to promote support for

inccoat of arms of new brunswick canencyclopædia britannica incthe first englishspeaking settlers from new england moved into the st john river valley and founded the town of maugerville in  but it was the influx of some  loyalist refugees from the american revolution mostly from new york and its vicinity that created the pressure for separate provincehood the loyalist city of saint john became canada’s first incorporated city in  and smaller settlements were established in the st john and st croix valleysafter early problems of adjustment the loyalist communities of new brunswick began to prosper underlying the improved economy was the british decision in  to grant preferential tariffs to the timber resources of its north american colonies a move made when napoleon i’s blockade cut off the baltic supply of shipbuilding materials to the british for new brunswick with its limited agricultural lands but widespread forests this historical incident provided an opportunity that helped usher in the socalled age of wood wind and water an era of prosperity based on timber exports and shipbuilding the reciprocity treaty with the united states in  and the demand created by the american civil war further stimulated tradepolitically the province moved slowly toward a more democratic system government in the first generation was dominated by a loyalist elite supported by british imperial authority responsible home government government in which the executive branch is drawn from and answerable to an elected legislative branch was granted by britain in  political parties organized largely along ethnic and religious lines and prompted by the prohibition issue emerged in the s with its economic success and political independence new brunswick entered confederation with canada in  somewhat reluctantlyconfederation however coincided with the collapse of the age of wooden ships and new brunswickers found themselves scrambling over the next  years to rebuild their economy on a new foundation railroads and national tariffs helped in the development of manufacturing such as that of cotton textiles but the province suffered from the pull of the urban growth areas of quebec and ontario by the th century new brunswick required federally subsidized freight rates and it argued along with other maritime provinces for federal financial assistance which after the mids it obtainedmeanwhile a modern party system emerged in which until the s the old elements of ethnicity and religion continued to be significant liberals and progressive conservatives alternated in government at fairly regular intervals in the midth century both parties sought economic development based on new electrical power facilities in the s a liberal equal opportunity program revolutionized the delivery of health justice education and social services by abolishing counties as administrative units and by centralizing funding and administration at the provincial level unique in canada the system met strong early resistance but it continued under the subsequent conservative government and won acceptance especially in lessprosperous rural and northern areas as a means of equalizing services in all parts of the province since the late s both liberal and conservative governments have emphasized fiscal restraint balanced budgets the restructuring of public services and a reduction in dependence on federal financial support in the s and early st century governments continued to pursue economic selfsufficiencynew brunswickers think of their province with its two languages and cultures as a microcosm of canada moreover the province’s small size tends to promote support for canadian federalism among members of both linguistic groups even at the beginning of the

its present boundariesseal of new brunswick canencyclopædia britannica inccoat of arms of new brunswick canencyclopædia britannica incthe first englishspeaking settlers from new england moved into the st john river valley and founded the town of maugerville in  but it was the influx of some  loyalist refugees from the american revolution mostly from new york and its vicinity that created the pressure for separate provincehood the loyalist city of saint john became canada’s first incorporated city in  and smaller settlements were established in the st john and st croix valleysafter early problems of adjustment the loyalist communities of new brunswick began to prosper underlying the improved economy was the british decision in  to grant preferential tariffs to the timber resources of its north american colonies a move made when napoleon i’s blockade cut off the baltic supply of shipbuilding materials to the british for new brunswick with its limited agricultural lands but widespread forests this historical incident provided an opportunity that helped usher in the socalled age of wood wind and water an era of prosperity based on timber exports and shipbuilding the reciprocity treaty with the united states in  and the demand created by the american civil war further stimulated tradepolitically the province moved slowly toward a more democratic system government in the first generation was dominated by a loyalist elite supported by british imperial authority responsible home government government in which the executive branch is drawn from and answerable to an elected legislative branch was granted by britain in  political parties organized largely along ethnic and religious lines and prompted by the prohibition issue emerged in the s with its economic success and political independence new brunswick entered confederation with canada in  somewhat reluctantlyconfederation however coincided with the collapse of the age of wooden ships and new brunswickers found themselves scrambling over the next  years to rebuild their economy on a new foundation railroads and national tariffs helped in the development of manufacturing such as that of cotton textiles but the province suffered from the pull of the urban growth areas of quebec and ontario by the th century new brunswick required federally subsidized freight rates and it argued along with other maritime provinces for federal financial assistance which after the mids it obtainedmeanwhile a modern party system emerged in which until the s the old elements of ethnicity and religion continued to be significant liberals and progressive conservatives alternated in government at fairly regular intervals in the midth century both parties sought economic development based on new electrical power facilities in the s a liberal equal opportunity program revolutionized the delivery of health justice education and social services by abolishing counties as administrative units and by centralizing funding and administration at the provincial level unique in canada the system met strong early resistance but it continued under the subsequent conservative government and won acceptance especially in lessprosperous rural and northern areas as a means of equalizing services in all parts of the province since the late s both liberal and conservative governments have emphasized fiscal restraint balanced budgets the restructuring of public services and a reduction in dependence on federal financial support in the s and early st century governments continued to pursue economic selfsufficiencynew brunswickers think of their province with its two languages and cultures as a microcosm of canada moreover the province’s small size tends to promote support for

inccoat of arms of new brunswick canencyclopædia britannica incthe first englishspeaking settlers from new england moved into the st john river valley and founded the town of maugerville in  but it was the influx of some  loyalist refugees from the american revolution mostly from new york and its vicinity that created the pressure for separate provincehood the loyalist city of saint john became canada’s first incorporated city in  and smaller settlements were established in the st john and st croix valleysafter early problems of adjustment the loyalist communities of new brunswick began to prosper underlying the improved economy was the british decision in  to grant preferential tariffs to the timber resources of its north american colonies a move made when napoleon i’s blockade cut off the baltic supply of shipbuilding materials to the british for new brunswick with its limited agricultural lands but widespread forests this historical incident provided an opportunity that helped usher in the socalled age of wood wind and water an era of prosperity based on timber exports and shipbuilding the reciprocity treaty with the united states in  and the demand created by the american civil war further stimulated tradepolitically the province moved slowly toward a more democratic system government in the first generation was dominated by a loyalist elite supported by british imperial authority responsible home government government in which the executive branch is drawn from and answerable to an elected legislative branch was granted by britain in  political parties organized largely along ethnic and religious lines and prompted by the prohibition issue emerged in the s with its economic success and political independence new brunswick entered confederation with canada in  somewhat reluctantlyconfederation however coincided with the collapse of the age of wooden ships and new brunswickers found themselves scrambling over the next  years to rebuild their economy on a new foundation railroads and national tariffs helped in the development of manufacturing such as that of cotton textiles but the province suffered from the pull of the urban growth areas of quebec and ontario by the th century new brunswick required federally subsidized freight rates and it argued along with other maritime provinces for federal financial assistance which after the mids it obtainedmeanwhile a modern party system emerged in which until the s the old elements of ethnicity and religion continued to be significant liberals and progressive conservatives alternated in government at fairly regular intervals in the midth century both parties sought economic development based on new electrical power facilities in the s a liberal equal opportunity program revolutionized the delivery of health justice education and social services by abolishing counties as administrative units and by centralizing funding and administration at the provincial level unique in canada the system met strong early resistance but it continued under the subsequent conservative government and won acceptance especially in lessprosperous rural and northern areas as a means of equalizing services in all parts of the province since the late s both liberal and conservative governments have emphasized fiscal restraint balanced budgets the restructuring of public services and a reduction in dependence on federal financial support in the s and early st century governments continued to pursue economic selfsufficiencynew brunswickers think of their province with its two languages and cultures as a microcosm of canada moreover the province’s small size tends to promote support for canadian federalism among members of both linguistic groups even at the beginning of the

march   by doug varty md i don’t know about you but i for one am sick and tired of the defeatist approach to the concept of multiple emr vendors in this province   sometimes it seems that the parade of excuses goes on forever we can do without the negative thinking  pessimists and naysayers need to stop obstructing progress and make way for others with vision and a “can do” attitude there are those who believe emr vendor’s just can’t make it in this province unless they sign up  clients and have a secret contract to hobble the competition  these same people note that there are fifteen vendors currently supplying doctors in this province    even though these vendors only have a handful of clients they seem to be doing just fine despite being undermined by the data sharing agreement   velante’s claim that their product can only survive by cutting the legs out from under the competition speaks volumes to the weakness of their business plan a well planned business should stand on it’s own two legs and not need to be propped up by government handouts and secret deals which foul the waters for competitors play fair or get off the field nobody wanted the velante system to fail but fail it has the minister of health says the province may step in to bail out the sinking velante vessel  ironically that may result in another plan just as expensive and centralized as the current one which will compel doctors to use a “one size fits all” emr   that’s a scenario which is to be avoided here is my plan  it’s cost effective provides for freedom of choice for doctors and will improve health care outcomes admit the velante plan has failed   let’s cut our losses and disband or remodel the company  cut accreon out of it   intrahealth should be able to continue to provide support to the  doctors currently using their software tear up the data sharing agreement allow any vendor who is prepared to pay the cost of interconnecting with doh computers to do so   any vendor who cannot pay the cost can still function under current conditions just as they have been all along establish a system of “sentinals”   by this i mean a group of doctors selected from all parts of new brunswick who are advanced emr users each with practices of over  patients who are making full use of their emr’s including the use of standard icd disease coding  employ a provincial health statistician whose job it will be to collect data from the sentinel physicians in order to provide statistics on disease prevalence and control medication use immunization rates and utilization of health care resources – all on a quarterly basis   with even a dozen doctors participating you will have a sample of  or more which should be adequate to provide reliable figures for the province to use sentinal physicians would receive a monthly stipend to compensate them for the additional time and effort required to keep their records in a state which permits easy data mining this plan would accomplish several important goals physicians would be free to choose the emr which best suits their needs or continue to use a paper based system   over the next  or  years the proportion of doctors using emrs is going to grow with out any help as new doctors don’t want paper charts and are part of a more techsavvy generation physicians could choose an emr which interconnects with doh databases if they wish or a simpler system – which is likely to be the choice of many specialists – with more limited capabilities  physicians who do not interconnect can still access the provincial ehr as they can now using the existing portal the department of health would benefit from access to data from a representative sample of the population which if designed properly by a competent statistician would give very accurate and usable information early adopters could take on the role they should have had all along as the greatest supporters and promoters of emr technology the it industry would receive a boost by having the opportunity to write software packages which could perform functions such as data migration for patients who move from another province and are able to bring their electronic medical file with them   we will need people to develop apps and provide security and data encryption programs for tablets and laptops maybe even smartphones the only downside to this plan is that accreon would lose one of its cash cows   even this might not be much of a loss as that cow is currently producing sour milk and not much of it this system implemented properly would realize tremendous savings to the province while still providing the data the department needs   doctor buyin and satisfaction would rocket upward   the it sector for small local players would get a huge boost the time has come for nb emr  are you in or out keeping an open mind… posted on march   by doug varty md   benoit essiambre is a monctonbased software developer with a keen interest in seeing an end to the velante monopoly   his vision of the future of electronic medical records in new brunswick stands in stark contrast to the exclusionary “take it or leave it” philosophy of the new brunswick medical society and their wealthy business associate accreon   essiambre would like to dismantle the information silos that have been cobbled together for private profit and foresees a day when we are free from barriers to open yet secure exchange of health care information here’s what he has to say as a software developer there is one aspect i feel qualified to comment on which didn’t get much attention and may explain nbms’s mistakes with velante to software guys like me it is obvious that when choosing software one of the most important aspect to look at is vendor lockin this has been well known in the software world for a long time non technical organisations are starting to realize it too for example the uk government has a guide httpswwwgovukservicemanualmakingsoftwarechoosingtechnology warning of lockin when choosing software in the private world companies are quite averse to lockin from other companies that is why open source is gaining so much popularity in the tech business world one area where it is particularly critical to not bestow control is core data infrastructure by this i mean the systems that holds the most important data and that controls how and what other systems interface and communicate with it medical records are one of the most important documents in the medical world so it makes absolutely no sense to stash them in a single system controlled by a single private company and let them charge for access this doesn’t mean that proprietary software is always bad i have created many closed source applications myself but these systems are better as addon components or for tasks that require special and unique proprietary technology not to hold and process your core data the risk that your data will be held hostage and that you will have to pay inflated prices for continued proper access is too high  you can add clauses to contracts to try to keep access rights to your data however this ignores technological limitations information and data complexity is a fundamental even mathematical property of software systems it is nearly impossible to make independent and closed systems data formats compatible with each others in changing and evolving applications at the very least if you have to migrate to a different system you will have high costs a difficult transition period and a situation where you will require help from the company you are leaving which will have no incentives make things easier in your departure there are better alternatives some people have suggested allowing multiple emr systems and thus some competition which is certainly an improvement over a monopoly however even better some type of systems are developed under the “open source” model this means that companies working on the system are required to make public the source code used to build the system it means multiple companies can work on the system improve it and compete on offering support and services for it developers usually cooperate publicly on forums as you can see here httposcarmcmasterxnabblecom for the oscar emr used by thousands of doctors accross the country i was recently part of the implantation of oscar emr in a new clinic in moncton for five doctors the installation was easy and took less than a day the cost for support is about  month per doctor and i estimated that our  year cost for the clinic will be about   had we signed up for the intrahealth system in the same time frame we would have paid   upfront   in monthly fees and the government would have put up   for a total of   or  times the price of our current more open and more compatible and in my opinion more future proof system  you can clearly see the effect that competition amongst multiple companies has on price sure you can find vendors charging high prices but that is usually because they already have a large user base lockedin their legacy system and they wouldn’t want to set a lower price precedent for these users here are some important questions that need answers has nbms properly evaluated the risk of letting a single private company’s closed software intrahealth control every newbrunswicker’s medical record if the exclusivity contract was necessary to lower prices why is the price  times that of a competing leading edge system shouldn’t the price be lower not higher if it is so difficult and costly to make multiple systems connect to hospital data why did velante have to contractually forbid others from this connectivity to prevent it i personally talked to developers and got very reasonable prices to do the work a few tens of thousands of dollars lower than the price difference between just a few installation of intrahealth and oscar it’s not as if you have to provide different connection protocols for each system you only need to provide a single type of connection based on the secure standards defined by canada health infoway and make it the responsibility of the different emrs to adhere to this standard the standardization work on this communication channel has already been performed by other provinces why has velante been trying to push our small clinic into a   system when we were able to get a better one for   catch of the day… posted on march   by doug varty md last september in moncton a few of us gathered at the local moncton restaurant to celebrate the approval of my resolution which directed the leadership of the nbms not to impede emr users from connecting with department of health computers one of those present said he had seen one of the velante team members in a serious pout  walking down the sidewalk and saying petulantly “it’s not fair  i worked so hard on this” it’s a fact of life that hard work is not a guarantee of success  i could work really hard at trying to grow pineapples in my backyard or catch a tuna in killarney lake but it ain’t gonna happen sometimes it is not the person who is to blame   it’s not that the velante marketer didn’t work hard enough   it’s just that the plan was faulty from the outset   more research should have been done to determine how many doctors wanted an emr which product was acceptable to them and what they would be prepared to pay    now unfortunately velante is heading down a road to nowhere with no easy way to turn back  there simply are not sufficient numbers of doctors in this province with enough interest in the velante plan to make it work to the credit of the velante folk they don’t quit easily   recognizing that the secret monopoly deal was in jeopardy and that their product might actually have to – perish the thought – compete for clients on a level playing field those at the top decided to bury the resolution in red tape and blamecasting first i was told that the executive committee would have to come up with an implementation plan for the resolution and that i should be patient  for a while they continued to deny the existence of the secret data sharing arrangement   finally when someone was good enough to obtain a copy of the covert document the cat was finally out of the bag at this point the velante strategy changed regarding the possibility of adding more vendors   now it was the minister of health who “wouldn’t hear of it”   that’s the word i got from nbms board chairman dr david flower a man who i hold in the highest regard and for whom i have great respect   when dave tells you something you know   he has thought carefully about it and   he firmly believes what he tells you to be true now the story being told by the minister of health which he told to me in a oneonone conversation is that one of the leaders of the nbms did not come to him and say “gee mr flemming this isn’t my idea but as a result of a resolution passed at the nbms annual general meeting i am compelled to ask you to consider renegotiating the data sharing agreement to allow for more than one vendor”   should have been simple enough   if it were true that the minister would not hear of such a thing he would be quite quick to tell the nbms to take a hike and they could go on their merry way  at that point it would have been case closed   no point lobbying the nbms   the minister is not willing to talk about it however if we are to believe the minister – and i do – he was approached by one of the nbms leaders and the conversation went something like this nbms  “uh mr flemming you’re not thinking about opening up the data sharing agreement to allow for more than one emr vendor are you   i mean we have a deal don’t we” moh  “yes we have a deal   i intend to honour that agreement” nbms  “ok  great then  umm  how about those maple leafs” i do not have a great deal of faith that any genuine effort was made to respect the wishes of the membership and implement the resolution as intended   that failure to proceed as directed has led us to where we are today  the attempt to move ahead with the intent of the resolution appears to have been halfhearted at best selfserving and duplicitous at worst   or maybe that is being too generous now the nbms strategy has changed again   following the minister’s very clear statement last week that he is quite willing to amend the data sharing agreement now it is the nbms that say it is nonnegotialble   they claim that if even one more vendor is added to the mix their business plan will fail well guess what it already failed  get over it you can’t sell doctors an expensive product that they don’t like you can’t grow pineapples in new maryland and there are no tuna in killarney lake let’s just move on to data sharing agreement … epilogue… posted on february   by doug varty md i think the message is starting to get through new brunswick’s electronic medical record monopoly needs to be scrapped and replaced by something more acceptable to doctors and the public here’s to hoping good news is coming our way from the leadership of the nbms at their media conference tomorrow let’s wipe the slate clean open the door to a competitive emr marketplace and get on with the business of looking after the health of our patients they deserve nothing less common courtesy… posted on february   by doug varty md prior to enrolling in medical school i had thought of medicine as a noble calling  an honourable profession characterized by scientific certainty propriety decency concern for others long hours selfsacrifice and hard work   the doctors i read about were exemplary human beings   this view was certainly bolstered by being a childhood patient of dr lee stickles fredericton’s iconic and beloved pediatrician  inspired by his easygoing patience and professionalism i had medicine on my mind when i started at unb in the fall of  it wasn’t that easy   though capable of making good grades i had difficulty settling down to work in the new environment   so many interesting people and things to do   i gravitated to the campus radio station immersing myself in the music and technology of the broadcasting business   i spent too much time doing things that though fun at the time were not leading me down the path to medical school acceptance it was only years later having gained some important work experience and perspective on life that i returned to unb with a new outlook and a plan   i made the marks required to be accepted to medical school and i never looked back we as physicians tend to support one another   the hippocratic oath exhorts us to respect out teachers  we support our colleagues  it comes i believe from the common bond we share   the bond of dedication to our patients the desire to promote health and fight disease and to try to leave the world when all is said and done in better shape than we found it  one of my biology professors told me before i left for halifax that medical school in terms of rigidity of discipline was second only to marine corps training   he was right   it was four years of unending study long hours  intense exposure to human suffering poor sleep hasty meals and exam after exam after exam   it’s the kind of environment where you develop friendships that last a lifetime with people you know you can trust with your life i trust my physician colleagues in the new brunswick medical society i know that the president of the nbms respects the wishes of the membership and will do all that she can to implement the resolutions of september’s annual general meeting including the one that i put forth  my resolution directed that the nbms not impede nonvelante emr users in their quest to improve the capabilities of the systems they have implemented at their own expense and used for years what ought to be done what must be done is for the president of the nbms to make a sincere written request to the minister of health to amend the data sharing agreement of june  to allow for multiple emr vendors  it must be the president who does this   this task cannot be delegated   it cannot be mumbled or muttered in a halfhearted way and the request cannot be dropped at the first sign of resistance   to fall short of this – to ignore the wishes of the membership – brings discredit and disrepute to the society and shame to the medical profession the rot sets in… posted on february   by doug varty md beverly hackett’s wonderful illustration of amanita muscaria is a reminder that even from rot and decay can come things of beauty new brunswick’s efforts to establish a working and widely accepted provincial electronic medical record system is at risk of becoming mushroom fodder   if this unfortunate scenario is to be averted those responsible must desist with their mad and singleminded obsession with profit and an unwanted illconsidered monopoly   a more inclusive approach is needed   the program as it is sits poised on the brink of collapse i hope it doesn’t come to that  it’s not too late to welcome all new brunswick doctors into the fold but first the existing divisive and discriminatory data sharing agreement between the new brunswick medical society and the provincial department of health must be shredded and thrown on the compost heap where it belongs perhaps something more elegant will arise from the detritus here’s to hoping   forcing a fit… posted on january   by doug varty md making it work takes a little longer  making it work takes a little time –  doug bennett the emr experience in the united kingdom should not be ignored   painful lessons have been learned about putting all your eggs in one basket with a single monolithic electronic record system   in the article linked below  some of the analysis refers to the hospitalbased ehr rather than the officebased emr which is the focus of this blog but the findings can easily be extrapolated new brunswick is plunging headlong to the same disastrous muddle that has befallen our british cousins   it bears thinking about we don’t all work the same and even within medical specialties there are differences in how people use computers and what software suits their eye   choice is the key element in physician satisfaction with emrs   forcing a fit is never a good idea “there are huge differences between a surgical specialty practice primary care and hospital systems the result of a onesizefits all mentality in healthcare is a lowest common denominator approach to building solutions which has led to generic yet shockingly expensive products that are not well liked or used”  – daniel cane ceo of modernizing medicine anyone listening   is that a path we want to go down i think not it’s time for doctors to decide what they want in an emr    time to stop the tail from wagging the dog   it professionals are key players in developing more fully functional electronic medical record systems but we should be telling them what we need  physicians need to lead not follow  software vendors need to find out what works for us then make it happen   and if they can’t do it we should find someone who can   that’s the beauty of a free and open marketplace   it fosters innovation and healthy competition a good first step would be ending the emr monopoly in new brunswick   it is ludicrous that physicians in this province are being offered only one emr solution   no one would tolerate going to a restaurant with only one item on the menu   yet that’s the choice offered by velante as they attempt shepherd us into their shearing barn fortunately physicians don’t herd well “ehr companies have followed a business model whereby they control all data rather than liberating the data for use in innovative applications in clinical care” –  dr farzad mostashari well said we need a variety of systems that talk to each other    it’s not a question of whether it can be done   it’s a question of will as you are about to read health it authorities in the united kingdom have made it quite clear that “interoperability is a key priority …  if there is not sufficient progress or we continue to see barriers that create data silos or ‘walled gardens’ we will… consider other options to achieve our policy intent” this is the kind of leadership and vision that is sorely lacking in new brunswick  both our department of health and our medical society would do well to take a lesson from the british experience with electronic medical records   there needs to be more emphasis on enabling health care providers more vision and innovation and above all we need to learn from those who have gone before us enjoy the read httpwwwcanhealthcomtfdnewshtml search

records in new brunswick… tag archives province of new brunswick christmas is coming… posted on november   by doug varty md hi i’ve been away for a bit but this is too shocking not to pass along i’ve always been a proponent of choosing health care software carefully but out in british columbia they appear to have hit a new low  apparently in nanaimo the ehr system chosen by the local health authority is so bad they have to pay doctors to use it doctors will pay top dollar to use a highend emr that improves patient care and streamlines routine tasks they will begrudgingly accept a secondline system like the one being flogged by the nbms if user fees are subsidized by their peers but apparently you really do have to pay people to use one that is truly abysmal see for yourselves… httpwwwhospitalemrandehrcomhealthsystempaysdocstousecernerehr gotcha posted on september   by doug varty md more thoughtful analysis of the american emr experience courtesy of the kevinmdcom website it is becoming apparent that more and more emr users are finding themselves trapped with an emr that they either did not want or that they signed up for only because of fire sale prices enabled by government subsidization hmmmm… sounds familiar… the result is that customer satisfaction is in freefall yet more evidence that the new brunswick approach of “my way or the highway” is wrong dead wrong read on to find out why and how we could do things differently here i despise my ehr but i’m still using it the holy grail… posted on july   by doug varty md as the new brunswick emr dream of “one patient one record” continues to unravel and costs skyrocket there is growing recognition outside of the realm of the new brunswick medical society that the key to successful and meaningful use of electronic medical records lies in getting disparate systems to talk to each other it is abundantly clear that we need a variety of emr software packages to fit a variety of physician needs and that these products need to be able to exchange data with a minimum of fuss and bother achieving this might be akin to finding the holy grail at least according to a recent article by dr eric cadesky of vancouver published in the june  edition of “future practice” the analogy fits to a degree but a better analogy might be finding the rosetta stone the original “interoperability engine” you can read the full article here interoperability the holy grail of emr’s the message is clear and there is a rising tide of voices opposed to the suppression of information sharing as exemplified by the curiously named data sharing agreement between the new brunswick government and the new brunswick medical society time to step back and rethink the plan blindly pursuing a model which relies on a single emr vendor runs counter to what is best for patients and the medical community we need interoperability and the sooner the better if we are to make any progress toward that goal we need buyin on the part of the nbms and the new brunswick government sadly we have neither the future is now… posted on may   by doug varty md yesterday was a great day for the dozens of telus emr users in new brunswick and for their estimated  plus patients   the most recent software upgrade has some innovative advances in functionality and convenience but most importantly telus clients now can have instant continually updated access to their emr data anywhere anytime it’s all done by simply downloading an app which allows the user’s phone to be linked to the office emr  with the new software telus clients can access their patient data office schedule and contact information in seconds via a secure passwordprotected encrypted portal as far as i know no other vendor in the province has anything like this which is a shame because it is definitely going to make doctors’ lives a whole lot easier   and it is only the beginning thinking about buying an emr system   as the saying goes “choose wisely”  it’s a major investment of time and money and you want to go with a company that can deliver the goods if you are interested in what telus has to offer this is a good starting point  httpswwwtelushealthcohealthsolutionselectronicmedicalrecordsoverviewredirectbeta and here is a link to the app store  httpsitunesapplecomcaapptelusemrmobileidmt think this is the final piece of the emr puzzle that you needed to take the plunge  still not convinced  why not get a demo of the software  you won’t be disappointed   httpwwwtelushealthcomemrsolutionportfoliodefaultaspxgclidcjkeqjwmqyqbrczknofiodcbeiqatecttdbnlnauxcmqgvqlyykeasxhiqijnkgaaixnphaq now i’ve been saving the best for last other emr vendors have been known to jealously guard and protect their turf from competitors  one even signed a secret deal with the government preventing doctors form accessing their patients’ medical information telus is actively promoting and developing technology which allows different emr systems to talk to each other making efficient straightforward exchange of information a reality  in the emr business it’s known as interoperability    it’s more than just a buzzword  it’s the way of the future a populus global solution… posted on february   by doug varty md local it company populus global solutions and it’s electronic medical record system is taking the world – or parts of it – by storm   it’s being sold on its own merits to a variety of caribbean countries and looking to expand into even more countries  it’s a refreshing approach popular rapidly implemented on budget and on schedule   most importantly they don’t rely on secret exclusionary deals to get a leg up on competitors your can read about it here in new brunswick it’s clearly time to rethink our provincial emr monopoly   not just because accreon is bailing out of velante  not just because the existing emr program is costing a fortune   not just because the uptake remains questionable despite firesale prices and highpressure sales pitches we need to reconsider what we are doing with emrs in new brunswick because the fundamental concept of an exclusionary monopoly – such as that forged by velante and the provincial government – is wrongheaded and lacking in vision we don’t need a single emr vendor jammed down the unwilling gullets of an unwilling clientele   we need choice  we need a product which fits the needs of the customer it’s not about profit  it’s not about lining the pockets of it consultants   it’s about using appropriate technology to improve the health of new brunswickers that’s the only bottom line that matters   we’re number … posted on december   by doug varty md congratulations new brunswick  percent of your doctors cite lack of “compatibility with other electronic systems” as a barrier to accessing electronic medical records   coincidentally or not we are the only province with an ironically named “data sharing agreement” which severely limits access to patient data for a large proportion of emr users a full  of new brunswick physicians said access to electronic records was “unsatisfactory” much higher than even newfoundland which came in second with   only  of new brunswick doctors said access was “excellent” ranking us second worst in the country  only quebec scored lower with  time to smarten up and get with the program new brunswick   information silos are not helpful   interoperability is the way of the future abolish the data sharing agreement now more information from the latest national physician survey is available here  nps  running free… posted on october   by doug varty md “and then one day you find ten years have got behind you  no one told you when to run  you missed the starting gun”  pink floyd – “time” as new brunswick continues to buck the worldwide trend for interoperability between health care information systems it seems appropriate to pause for a moment and consider how long this battle has been going on and give credit to the early adopters of electronic medical records for recognizing the importance of various electronic systems being able to talk to each other  not only were early adopters first out of the blocks with new technology in most cases they paid their own way recognizing that improved handling of patient records would have important benefits for the their practice and for the patients for whom they provide services interoperability is the key to the establishment of a healthy emr industry in new brunswick flash back to  and this insightful report from the american college of physicians data sharing in  everywhere there is progress dismantling information silos in favour of the free exchange of health care information everywhere but here the new brunswick provincial emr program is stuck in a rut jealously guarding access to information in order to further the monopolistic ambitions of a single vendor  the proponents of the plan boast of the dozens of doctors who are said to have started to use their emr product   they have been able to achieve a modicum of success in a variety of ways    handing out taxpayer money to offset their clients’ cost and  forging a secret deal with the department of health in order to cripple the competition does that make for fair competition i think not even i could run a faster  metres than usain bolt if his ankles were shackled         search recent posts christmas is coming… gotcha the holy grail… the future is now… a

nouveaubrunswick canadian french pronunciation nuvobʁɔnzwɪk  listen is one of canadas three maritime provinces together with prince edward island and nova scotia and is the only constitutionally bilingual english–french province the principal cities are fredericton the capital greater moncton currently the largest metropolitan cma area and the most populous city and the port city of saint john which was the first incorporated city in canada and largest in the province for  years until citation needed in the canada  census statistics canada estimated the provincial population to have been  down very slightly from  in  on an area of almost  km the majority of the population is englishspeaking of anglo and celtic heritage but there is also a large francophone minority  chiefly of acadian origin it was created as a result of the partitioning of the british colony of nova scotia in  and was originally named new ireland with the capital to be in saint john the name was soon replaced with new brunswick by king george iii the provincial flag features a ship superimposed on a yellow background with a yellow lion passant guardant on red pennon above it contents  etymology

province is named after the city of braunschweig known in english and low german the language originally spoken in the area as brunswick located in modernday lower saxony in northern germany and also the former duchy of the same name the thencolony was named in  to honour the reigning british monarch george iii who was concurrently duke and princeelector of brunswicklüneburg hanover in the holy roman empire historyedit main article history of new brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus

incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of

those who are bilingual language policy remains a perennial issue in new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in

currently the largest metropolitan cma area and the most populous city and the port city of saint john which was the first incorporated city in canada and largest in the province for  years until citation needed in the canada  census statistics canada estimated the provincial population to have been  down very slightly from  in  on an area of almost  km the majority of the population is englishspeaking of anglo and celtic heritage but there is also a large francophone minority  chiefly of acadian origin it was created as a result of the partitioning of the british colony of nova scotia in  and was originally named new ireland with the capital to be in saint john the name was soon replaced with new brunswick by king george iii the provincial flag features a ship superimposed

british monarch george iii who was concurrently duke and princeelector of brunswicklüneburg hanover in the holy roman empire historyedit main article history of new brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests new brunswick changed from more than twothirds rural before  to predominantly urban by  education and health care were poorly funded and in the s and s the rates of illiteracy and infant mortality were among the highest in canada during the period –  of new brunswicks small farms disappeared as the agroindustry took root the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers who lived in the south of the province the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the ambitious equal opportunity plan in which education rural road maintenance and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province county councils were abolished and the rural areas came under direct provincial jurisdiction the  official languages act made french an official language geographyedit main article geography

other maritime provinces physiographically climatologically and ethnoculturally both nova scotia and prince edward island are either surrounded by or are almost completely surrounded by water oceanic effects therefore tend to define their climate economy and culture on the other hand new brunswick although having a significant seacoast is sheltered from the atlantic ocean proper and has a large interior that is removed from oceanic influences as a result the climate tends to be more continental in character than maritime the major river systems of the province include the st croix river saint john river kennebecasis river petitcodiac river magaguadavic river miramichi river nepisiguit river and the restigouche river although smaller the bouctouche river richibucto river and kouchibouguac river are also important the settlement patterns and the economy of new brunswick are based more on the provinces river systems than its seacoasts because of this new brunswicks

services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and freedoms has a number of new brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of new brunswick in each section relating to language ex section  has two paragraphs the first regarding bilingual

declares that the french and english speaking communities of new brunswick have equal rights and privileges including community specific educational and cultural institutions this specific distinction

to time other parties such as the confederation of regions party have held seats in the legislature but only on the strength of a strong protest vote the dynamics of new brunswick politics are different from those of other canadian provinces the lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province in

culture was aboriginal in flavour influenced by the native populations who made their home along the coast and riverbanks until the arrival of frenchspeaking in the early th century and englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of glooscap began to emerge as described by the political historian arthur doyle an invisible line separated the two founding european cultures beginning on the eastern outskirts of moncton and running diagonally across the province northwest towards grand falls franconew brunswick acadie lay to the northeast of this divide and anglonew brunswick lay to the southwest doyles characterization was made not long after government reforms by former premier louis j robichaud had significantly improved the status of frenchspeaking acadians within the province and initiated their journey towards cultural recognition and equality with their englishspeaking counterparts the capitol theatre in moncton early new brunswick was influenced by its colonial ties to france england scotland and ireland as well as by its geographical proximity to new england and the arrival of about  loyalists in  as local society was founded in forestry and seaborne endeavours a tradition of lumber camp songs and sea shanties prevailed acadian cloggers and irish and scots step dancers competed at festivals to expressive fiddle and accordion music the art of storytelling wellknown to the native populations passed

landscape as would later writers as well in painting individual artists such as anthony flower worked in obscurity either through design or neglect while others such as edward mitchell bannister left the province before ever developing a local influence few thcentury artists emerged but those who did often benefited from fine arts training at mount allison university in sackville which began offering classes in  the program came into its own under john a hammond who served from  to  alex colville and lawren harris later studied and taught art there and both christopher pratt and mary pratt were trained at mount allison the university’s art gallery – which opened in  and is named for its patron john owens of saint john – is canada’s oldest in frenchspeaking new brunswick it would

currently the largest metropolitan cma area and the most populous city and the port city of saint john which was the first incorporated city in canada and largest in the province for  years until citation needed in the canada  census statistics canada estimated the provincial population to have been  down very slightly from  in  on an area of almost  km the majority of the population is englishspeaking of anglo and celtic heritage but there is also a large francophone minority  chiefly of acadian origin it was created as a result of the partitioning of the british colony of nova scotia in  and was originally named new ireland with the capital to be in saint john the name was soon replaced with new brunswick by king george iii the provincial flag features a ship superimposed

british monarch george iii who was concurrently duke and princeelector of brunswicklüneburg hanover in the holy roman empire historyedit main article history of new brunswick the original first nations inhabitants of the area that would become new brunswick were members of three distinct but related tribes the largest tribe was the mikmaq and they occupied the eastern and coastal areas of the province they were responsible for the augustine mound a burial ground built about  bce near metepnákiaq red bank first nation the western portion of the province was the traditional home of the wolastoqiyik maliseet people the smaller passamaquoddy tribe occupied lands in the southwest of the province french colonial eraedit main article history of the acadians although it is possible that vikings may have reached as far south as new brunswick the first known european exploration of new brunswick was that of french explorer jacques cartier in  who discovered and named the bay of chaleur the next french contact was in  when a party led by pierre du gua de monts and samuel de champlain set up camp for the winter on st croix island between presentday new brunswick and maine the colony relocated the following year across the bay of fundy to port royal nova scotia over the next  years a number of other french settlements and seigneuries were founded in the area occupied by presentday new brunswick including along the saint john river the upper bay of fundy region in the tantramar marshes at beaubassin and finally at st pierre site of presentday bathurst the whole maritime region and parts of maine was at that time claimed by france and was designated as the colony of acadia british colonial eraedit one of the provisions of the treaty of utrecht of  was the surrender of acadia or nova scotia as it was called by the british to queen anne the bulk of the acadian population thus found themselves residing in the new british colony of nova scotia the remainder of acadia including the new brunswick region was only lightly populated and the two european powers contended over this illdefined territory the maliseet from their headquarters at meductic on the saint john river participated with the french in numerous guerilla raids and battles against new england during father rales war and king williams war a map of the american colonies as they stood during the th century what is now new brunswick was then known as acadia then a dominion of france about  to protect his interests in new france louis xv caused three forts fort beauséjour fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux to be built along the isthmus of chignecto this caused what is known to historians as father le loutres war because of the contended possession which had been in issue since before  a major french fortification the fortress of louisbourg was also built on île royale now cape breton island after queen annes war but the function of this fort was mostly to defend the approaches to the colony of canada not the lost province of acadiacitation needed during the french and indian war – the british completed their displacement of the acadians over all of presentday new brunswick because they took up arms against them when they had been requested repeatedly for decades not to do so fort beauséjour near sackville fort menagoueche and fort gaspareaux were captured with casualties on both sides by a british force commanded by lt col robert monckton in  inside fort beauséjour the british forces found not only french regular troops but also acadian irregulars governor charles lawrence of nova scotia used the discovery of acadians helping in the defence of the fort to order the expulsion of the acadian population from nova scotia the acadians of the recently captured beaubassin and petitcodiac regions were included in the expulsion order some of the acadians in the petitcodiac and memramcook region escaped and under the leadership of joseph broussard continued to conduct guerrilla action against the british forces for a couple of years other actions in the war included british expeditions up the saint john river in the st john river campaign fort anne fredericton fell during the  campaign and following this the legal de jure status of utretcht was settled and confirmed de facto by the treaty of paris  the coming of the loyalists painting by henry sandham showing a romanticised view of the loyalists arrival in new brunswick after the seven years war most of presentday new brunswick and parts of maine were confirmed as part of the colony of nova scotia and designated as sunbury county new brunswicks relatively isolated location on the bay of fundy away from the atlantic coastline proper tended to discourage settlement during the postwar period there were exceptions however such as the coming of new england planters to the sackville region and the arrival of pennsylvania dutch settlers in moncton in  in both these cases many of the new settlers took up land that had originally belonged to displaced acadians before the deportation there were several actions on new brunswick soil during the american revolutionary war the maugerville rebellion  the battle of fort cumberland  the siege of saint john  and the battle at miramichi  the battle of fort cumberland was the largest and most significant of these conflicts following the war significant population growth finally came to the area when  loyalists having lost the war came from the newly created united states arriving on the saint john river in  influential loyalists such as harvardeducated edward winslow saw themselves as the natural leaders of their community and that they should be recognized for their rank and that their loyalty deserved special compensation however they were not appreciated by the preloyalist population in nova scotia as colonel thomas dundas wrote from saint john they the loyalists have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of nova scotia therefore  prominent merchants and professionals petitioned for acre  km grants each winslow pressed for the creation of a loyalist colony – an asylum that could become the envy of the american states nova scotia was therefore partitioned in  britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies new brunswick cape breton island and presentday peninsular nova scotia in addition to the adjacent colonies of st johns island renamed prince edward island in  and newfoundland the colony of new brunswick was established as a separate province by an orderincouncil in great britain the th june citation needed sir thomas carleton was appointed as lieutenantgovernor on  august  and in  a new legislative assembly was established with the first elections the new colony was almost called new ireland after a failed attempt to establish a colony of that name in maine during the war the province later gained control over its crown lands in  even though the bulk of the loyalist population was located in parrtown saint john the decision was made by the colonial authorities to place the new colonial capital at st annes point fredericton about  km up the saint john river as it was felt that by placing the capital inland it would be less vulnerable to american attack the university of new brunswick was founded at fredericton at the same time  making it the oldest englishlanguage university in canada and the first public university in north america local government at a rural level was accomplished through a county and parish structure and the power to tax for the purpose of primary education was first granted by the province to the parishes in  grammar schools at the parish level followed in  and again in  initial loyalist population growth in the new colony extended along the fundy coastline from saint andrews to saint martins and up the kennebecasis and lower saint john river valleys during the late th and early th centuries some of the deported acadians from nova scotia found their way back to acadie where they settled mostly along the eastern and northern shores of the new colony of new brunswick here they lived in relative and in many ways selfimposed isolation additional immigration to new brunswick in the early part of the th century was from scotland western england and waterford ireland often after first having come through or having lived in newfoundland a large influx of settlers arrived in new brunswick after  from ireland as a result of the potato famine many of these people settled in saint john or chatham both saint john and the miramichi region remain largely irish today the northwestern border between maine and new brunswick had not been clearly defined by the treaty of paris  that had ended the american revolution by the late s population growth and competing lumber interests in the upper saint john river valley created the need for a definite boundary in the area during the winter of – the situation quickly deteriorated with both maine and new brunswick calling out their respective militias the aroostook war was bloodless but politically very tense and the boundary was subsequently settled by the websterashburton treaty of  the new brunswick and nova scotia land company a means of transferring land held by the crown to individual owners was chartered in new brunswick in  financed by shares sold in england this company purchased large areas of canadian land at low prices promising to develop roads mills and towns although the province was largely rural the colony prior to the middle of the century was not selfsufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary in fact governor douglas saw a silver lining in the great  miramichi fire he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs throughout the mid th century shipbuilding on the bay of fundy shore on the petitcodiac river at chatham on the miramichi river and at bathurst in the bay of chaleur became a dominant industry in new brunswick the marco polo a clipper ship holding the roundtrip speed record between liverpool and australia was launched from saint john in  the cunard family began to flourish here at that time resourcebased industries such as logging and farming were also important components of the new brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province to serve them and link the rural communities canadian provinceedit see also politics of new brunswick current licence plate new brunswick one of the four original provinces of canada entered the canadian confederation on july   the charlottetown conference of  which ultimately led to the confederation movement originally had been intended to discuss only a maritime union but concerns over the american civil war as well as fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding the scope of the proposed union this interest in an expanded union arose from the province of canada formerly upper and lower canada later ontario and quebec and a request was made by the canadian political leaders to the organizers of the maritime conference to have the meeting agenda altered although the maritime leaders were swayed by the arguments of the canadians many ordinary residents of the maritimes wanted no part of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union many politicians who supported confederation such as sir samuel leonard tilley new brunswicks bestknown father of confederation found themselves without a seat after the next election nevertheless backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed following confederation the fears of the anticonfederates were proven correct as new national policies and trade barriers were soon adopted by the central government thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the maritime provinces and new england the situation in new brunswick was exacerbated by both the great fire of  in saint john and the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of canada or to the united states to seek employment in his history of new brunswick hannay observes that the system of county government was as bad as possible because the magistrates were not responsible to any person the condition of the county accounts was never made public and it was not until a comparatively late period in the history of the province that the grand jury obtained legislative authority to inspect the county accounts and by  an act providing for compulsory municipal incorporation was put in force the province entered confederation with a legislative council of  members holding their seats for life a legislative assembly of  members and an executive council of nine members under its powers of changing the provincial constitution the legislative council was abolished by an act passed on april   as the th century dawned the provinces economy again began to expand manufacturing gained strength with the construction of textile mills such as the st croix cotton mill and in the crucial forestry sector the sawmills that had dotted inland sections of the province gave way to larger pulp and paper mills the railway industry meanwhile provided for growth and prosperity in the moncton region nevertheless unemployment remained high throughout the province and the great depression brought another setback two influential families the irvings and the mccains emerged from the depression to begin to modernise and vertically integrate the provincial economy—especially in the vital forestry food processing and energy sectors in the mids forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests new brunswick changed from more than twothirds rural before  to predominantly urban by  education and health care were poorly funded and in the s and s the rates of illiteracy and infant mortality were among the highest in canada during the period –  of new brunswicks small farms disappeared as the agroindustry took root the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers who lived in the south of the province the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about  per cent in  to  per cent in  and  per cent in  government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less developed than in the rest of the province this changed with the election of premier louis robichaud in  he embarked on the ambitious equal opportunity plan in which education rural road maintenance and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province county councils were abolished and the rural areas came under direct provincial jurisdiction the  official languages act made french an official language geographyedit main article geography

other maritime provinces physiographically climatologically and ethnoculturally both nova scotia and prince edward island are either surrounded by or are almost completely surrounded by water oceanic effects therefore tend to define their climate economy and culture on the other hand new brunswick although having a significant seacoast is sheltered from the atlantic ocean proper and has a large interior that is removed from oceanic influences as a result the climate tends to be more continental in character than maritime the major river systems of the province include the st croix river saint john river kennebecasis river petitcodiac river magaguadavic river miramichi river nepisiguit river and the restigouche river although smaller the bouctouche river richibucto river and kouchibouguac river are also important the settlement patterns and the economy of new brunswick are based more on the provinces river systems than its seacoasts because of this new brunswicks

acadians who were deported to louisiana are often referred to as cajuns in english much of the english canadian population of new brunswick is descended from loyalists who fled the american revolution

       languagesedit new brunswick is canadas only officially bilingual province and it is the only province where both official language communities are heavily represented with anglophone new brunswickers making up roughly twothirds of the population and the acadien or francophone new brunswicker population representing over  of the population people whose mother tongue is an officially recognized first nations languages or nonofficial language together make up about  of new brunswickers as a comparison the minority language communities of ontario and quebec francoontarians and anglophone quebeckers respectively make up less than  of those provinces populations with both official language communities so strongly represented new brunswick is home to both french and english language hospitals and healthcare networks school systems universities and media the province also has a relatively high proportion of people who state that they can speak both official languages with about  people or  of the population reporting the ability to speak both english and french though francophones make up twothirds of those who are bilingual language policy remains a perennial issue in new brunswick society and politics recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy duality the system of parallel french and english speaking public services and specifics of implementation the extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the new brunswick news cycle the frenchspeaking community continues to advocate for full funding of frenchlanguage public services and fair representation in public sector employment while some anglophones and francophones fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government as anglophones are less likely than francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment the provinces bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law the canadian constitution makes specific mention of new brunswicks bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals though this extends to community issues in terms of provision of schooling etc the canadian charter of rights and freedoms has a number of new brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of new brunswick in each section relating to language ex section  has two paragraphs the first regarding bilingual publication of the canadian parliaments work and laws the second specifying that new brunswicks legislature will publish its work in both french and english of particular interest is article  which declares that the french and english speaking communities of new brunswick have equal rights and privileges including community specific educational and cultural institutions this specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific

culture was aboriginal in flavour influenced by the native populations who made their home along the coast and riverbanks until the arrival of frenchspeaking in the early th century and englishspeaking settlers beginning in the mid th century aboriginal culture in turn quickly came under european influence through trade and religion even writing was affected see for example mikmaq hieroglyphic writing aboriginal societies were gradually marginalized under the reserve system and it was not until the late nineteenth century through the work of silas rand that the tales of glooscap began to emerge as described by the political historian arthur doyle an invisible line separated the two founding european cultures beginning on the eastern outskirts of moncton and running diagonally across the province northwest towards grand falls franconew brunswick acadie lay to the northeast of this divide and anglonew brunswick lay to the southwest doyles characterization was made not long after government reforms by former premier louis j robichaud had significantly improved the status of frenchspeaking acadians within the province and initiated their journey towards cultural recognition and equality with their englishspeaking counterparts the capitol theatre in moncton early new brunswick was influenced by its colonial ties to france england scotland and ireland as well as by its geographical proximity to new england and the arrival of about  loyalists in  as local society was founded in forestry and seaborne endeavours a tradition of lumber camp songs and sea shanties prevailed acadian cloggers and irish and scots step dancers competed at festivals to expressive fiddle and accordion music the art of storytelling wellknown to the native populations passed

landscape as would later writers as well in painting individual artists such as anthony flower worked in obscurity either through design or neglect while others such as edward mitchell bannister left the province before ever developing a local influence few thcentury artists emerged but those who did often benefited from fine arts training at mount allison university in sackville which began offering classes in  the program came into its own under john a hammond who served from  to  alex colville and lawren harris later studied and taught art there and both christopher pratt and mary pratt were trained at mount allison the university’s art gallery – which opened in  and is named for its patron john owens of saint john – is canada’s oldest in frenchspeaking new brunswick it would not be until the s that a comparable institution was founded the université de moncton then a cultural renaissance occurred under the influence of acadian historians and such teachers as claude
