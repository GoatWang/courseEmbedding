talent lives” is rooted in our durable competitive advantage of empowering the most talented entrepreneurial thought leaders to drive business success to new levels of achievement for our clients and

innovative people – the type of people that create the most value for organizations – thrive in an atypical environment  accordingly mdc generally establishes perpetual partnership with agency partners by initially acquiring  of firms and putting in place equitylinked ownership mechanisms for the nextgeneration management team thereby leaving a significant equity stake in the hands of the operating leadership  in addition at the corporate level we enlist worldclass executives with specialized expertise to support the ambitions and unique needs of our partners and clients mdc’s cultural and structural difference has enabled us to successfully create a billion dollar revenue platform with an infrastructure built for growth extraordinary thought leadership talent across our partner companies a global perspective and cutting edge marketing solutions that are social analytically based insightdriven and most importantly drive significant financial results for our clients  organic growth has long served as one of the strongest indicators that we are successfully partnering with clients to drive financial and operational results for them and we are proud that our organic growth has far outpaced and outperformed that of the industry over the last seven years what value does mdc bring to the agencies in its network mdc partners’ main focus is to provide our partner firms whatever resources they need to best service their respective clients and grow we do this by not only leveraging best practices and our capital but also by enlisting worldclass practicearea experts as
