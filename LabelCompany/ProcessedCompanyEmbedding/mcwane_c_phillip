business revisited  frontline  pbs related links the mcwane way today  what do the workers say mcwane and china mcwane president ruffner pages january  oncamera statement ruffner pages november  letter outlining what has changed at mcwane pdf philip mcwanes and ruffner pages statements at  sentencing hearing five years ago when a new york times reporter asked a mcwane lawyer for an interview with company executives he was told son the mcwanes havent talked in a hundred years and they arent about to start now today however its a different story while phillip mcwane himself still refuses to meet or talk with frontline mcwanes approach to media relations has changed dramatically when frontline contacted mcwane in  for an update to its original reporting mcwane president ruffner page responded almost immediately in a letter pdf file mr page wrote i welcome the opportunity to share information and talk about the dramatic transformation of our company since the original publication and broadcast gregory l vistica media consultant for mcwane over the course of the next three months mcwane sent additional letters as well as binders with thousands of pages of supporting materials as evidence of their turnaround mcwane also hired a strategic media adviser former investigative reporter gregory vistica who now makes a living by advising corporations and wealthy individuals on press strategy nearly all of our phone conversations and email communications were then channeled through mr vistica and occasionally mcwane general counsel james proctor who has been with the company since  while mcwane provided thorough written responses to most of frontlines questions certain issues were off the table for instance the company would not comment on any of their criminal cases citing ongoing litigation and appeals nor would mcwane entertain the idea of frontline meeting with or interviewing phillip mcwane the companys chairman as for meeting or an interview with ruffner page mcwanes president we were told that it was a possibility mr page initially agreed to a private dinner in birmingham but everything he said was to be offtherecord although he later allowed frontline to put on the record some portions of this conversation in the end mr page granted frontlines request to go on camera but he insisted that no questions be asked mr page agreed only to read a prepared statement and to be filmed walking through a mcwane plant their abi foundry in oakland calif at a mcwane sentencing hearing in december  for convictions for charges that were subsequently reversed on appeal mr page told the court that  percent of the senior managers of the company and its plants had been replaced during his first year as president of mcwane  to  he made similar claims in his oncamera statement however the public record and our own reporting indicates that many of the managers and vice presidents who were indicted were in managerial roles when mr page took over and stayed in similar roles until the federal indictments were returned we asked mcwane for a clarification at first they reported that nine managers were removed retired or terminated then they increased that number to  but did not provide names or other details while frontline was unsuccessful in speaking to phillip mcwane we obtained a transcript of a statement he made at the same  criminal sentencing hearing at which mr page spoke read both phillip mcwanes and ruffner pages comments at this hearing here overall while mcwane has argued that the original stories were onesided and inaccurate they acknowledge that the times and frontline accelerated the process of change at the company the increased scrutiny of the company by worker safety and environmental authorities mr page says forces them to live up to a higher standard which he says he welcomes as the company tries to become the industry leader the following are mcwane president ruffner pages ontherecord responses to questions that were posed in offcamera discussions with frontline the responses were provided by public relations consultant gregory vistica via email on jan   frontlines questions were edited for clarity the companys responses have been arranged by topic but otherwise have not been edited question what was the reaction of mcwane president ruffner page  and that of the corporation as a whole  to the original frontlinenew york times stories published and broadcast in january  response of course we were disappointed with the coverage and are troubled by the inaccurate impression it created of our company while several of our plants had experienced problems all resulting from different causes unique to each by the time of the  broadcast we were well down the road toward correcting them also the broadcast greatly overstated them and also created the misleading impression that all of our operations were experiencing problems when in fact most of them were and are well run well managed safe and compliant … we did not have a lot of experience with the press especially the national press the mcwane family has always been a very quiet private family as has their company even their millions of dollars in philanthropy usually were given anonymously during the summer of  we began to hear about reporters interviewing people about our company and that some of the people involved in the reporting appeared to be interested only in the negative for example in june of  one person said that a reporter told him that the nytfrontline intended to make mcwane into the enron of private industry another former personnel director told us that she told a reporter many positive things about the company but that the reporter was not interested and only wanted to get confirmation of negative rumors that reporter also referred to the several other people who had said good things about the company as flakes several months later we were contacted by mr bergman and mr barstow and asked to give an on camera interview but when asked they refused to tell us what questions would be asked as a result we were suspicious about the reporters motives and concluded that they did not intend to run a fair story and only wanted to ambush us on camera with surprise questions not for the purpose of understanding the truth but for the purpose of obtaining dramatic video footage nevertheless we supplied documents detailing the positive things we had done and responded to some of the allegations we had heard we made the decision only to communicate in writing until the reporters would tell us what they wanted to talk about which did not occur until a few weeks before the articles ran the articles and the documentary were a shock editors notes  in  mcwanes clow valve foundry in oskaloosa iowa was recognized as an osha voluntary protection program vpp merit site mcwane says they are the first iron and brass foundry operation in the country to gain that status oshas voluntary protection program vpp according to its website is official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health programs similar status has been given to mcwanes plant in elkhart ind mcwane also points out that it believes that its once troubled foundries are now industry leaders and that once their criminal prosecutions are over they intend to apply for the vpp program  as a matter of policy frontline and the new york times do not provide specific questions to subjects prior to any interview in this case however ahead of a potential ontherecord interview we submitted to mcwane a detailed letter containing  specific issues that would be addressed in the broadcast andor articles question without the prosecutions and the multimillion dollar fines a former prosecutor told us there would not have been the kind of turnaround that mcwane says it has made mcwane consultants say it accelerated the process did they response we started the process of correcting the problems at those facilities long before the prosecutors interviewed their first witness the adverse publicity from the broadcast only created pressure to make changes more quickly question there are those including whistleblowers former employees who were injured or the families of the deceased that are still skeptical about mcwane some underscored their skepticism by saying that the company continued to pay legal fees and salaries to vice presidents and plant managers after they were convicted why did mcwane retain these employees and pay their legal fees response we believe in the american constitutional principle that you are innocent until proven guilty and that every citizen is entitled to their day in court as you can appreciate legal representation is a very expensive process and beyond the means of most people all of our employees maintained their innocence and in fact several were found innocent and others won their appeals and had their convictions overturned consistent with our corporate bylaws early on in this process and with the governments full knowledge we agreed to pay for the defense of our employees the employees who were found innocent at trial and those whose convictions were recently overturned on appeal likely could not have defended themselves without the companys continued assistance as i am sure you know judge kaplan from new york recently penalized the government severely for its policy of trying to force companies to stop paying the legal fees of its employees concluding that the governments policy is a violation of the employees constitutional rights a copy of his opinion that discusses the issue in some detail is attached for your reference editors note mcwane refers to a  opinion written by southern district court of new york judge lewis a kaplan regarding consulting firm kpmgs refusal to advance or pay legal fees for employees question our understanding is that mcwanes osha and epa problems began with the company expanding rapidly spreading out across north america and that the company evolved into a structure that allowed its plants too much autonomy response mcwane always had a decentralized management structure that was intended to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship at the individual plants that model worked well with a small company in the s however the company grew very rapidly from  facilities in  to  in  and from  employees to  this growth created many challenges in managing all aspects of operations including compliance activities in some locations in the late s we recognized the need to revise our management systems and began a program of capital spending management changes the development of new compliance systems a program that was well underway by  question what was going on at mcwane in  response we first started to become aware of the problems in the late s and early s many were inherited because of the rapid expansion and decentralization of the company so that mcwane in birmingham really did not have a handle on all the problems as we became aware of the problems we began making capital and other expenditures and management changes to try and change things many of these changes were well underway by the time the stories came out response re turnaroundwe had initiated changes and were continuing in that direction long before  as a result of your articles the process accelerated question the associated press ran a story in  that quoted ruffner pagewe are nearing the point where we cant sustain multiple indictments and be a successful company mcwane president ruffner page said no company can responsethis comment came in the context of the indictments in birmingham ala and the empire coke soil sampling incident response re personnel changes we brought in the best people we could find to introduce new procedures i began going to mcwane cast iron after a meeting with john henshaw every morning i would go and see for myself what was going on today i along with others get email reports every time there is an injury or illness that leads to lost work days i began to change the management teams at the plants as early as  almost   of our senior and ehs management are either new or have been reassigned anyone who was unable to deal with the fact that we were going to change the way things were done especially from a health and safety and environment perspective was terminated or reassigned we have added more than  people for ehs including the best people we could find to run it response re on osha citations since  our record keeping and monitoring of health and safety as well as environmental practices strive to be the best in the business i think they are there now but we know that this is an ongoing process we are dedicated to improving our relationship with osha because of all of the negative publicity we know that we are held to a higher standard when we are inspected which results in more citations and higher penalties than others might receive for the same issues however we welcome that heightened scrutiny we hold ourselves to higher standards than what is acceptable in the industry and want to be the best when the regulators reinforce that effort by being harder on us they only help us get better if you think osha is tough you ought to meet barb wisniewski our health and safety vp she is as tough as they get and she has our full support response re mcwanes labor force and role in the economy our company makes products that are vital to our countrys infrastructure we make the pipe that brings water into our homes and takes the sewage out we make the fire hydrants for those same homes in the process we provide wellpaying safe jobs for more than  people including thousands of blue collar workers who can earn a comfortable middle class living even without a college education response re mcwane in china the factory in china began as an idea because of market pressures competitors were importing from china and india labor costs are low so importing fittings in particular makes economic sense and allows us to preserve our us operations as well we traveled first to india and saw the conditions there it was not acceptable we went to china where at least the conditions are not as primitive and decided to build our own plant which operates there today guided by employee health and safety protection and environmental controls similar to those in the united states in  we were awarded the excellent environmental protection facility of  from the cangzhou city environmental protection bureau the product that we make in china is the ductile iron waterworks fitting which has a high labor content we initially sought protection under  which is available through the government for protection from china dumping actions and even though the itc ruled unanimously in our favor the president declined to sign the petition as a result we were at such an economic disadvantage due to the low labor costs associated with chinas workforce that we were either going to have to build a plant a china outsource our operation or leave the business and our choice was to go build our own facility where we could control the environmental health and safety practices at that facility we did that through  and  developed a program we call china plus in china which exceeds the chinese environmental health and safety regulations enforce our employees there wearing protective equipment and as result we have a costcompetitive blend of products that we can offer our customers see frontlines short summary on mcwane and china response  injured employees in response to any employee thats hurt or injured while conducting their work at our facilities of course we feel terrible about that and we want our employees to go home safe every night and we want our employees to have good working conditions while theyre employed by mcwane editors note the public record reveals that mcwane has been cited  times by osha since our original publication and broadcast unlike its previous record none of the proposed citations was for a willful violation the most serious category under osha regulations osha has asked for  in fines one high fine of  occurred at kennedy valve in elmira new york for osha violations described in a press release as conditions that could expose employees to the dangers of fire lacerations amputation chemical burns crushing falls and eye face and hand injuriesread the osha release in the past five years according to mcwanes accounting submitted to frontline there have been more than  injuries at their plants around the country but most were relatively minor additionally there have been two deaths at mcwane foundries in february  timothy blow was decapitated when he fell into a sandsifting machine at kennedy valve in elmira new york during a related inspection osha proposed penalties of  but for violations the company said were not directly related to the machine that killed mr blow in january  thomas lawlor  an employee at atlantic states cast iron in phillipsburg new jersey  was crushed to death when a pipe rolled off a platform osha cited the company for violating exit standards and fined atlantic states  mr lawlors relatives are currently suing mcwane in civil court in interviews mcwanes ehs executives and their primary osha consultant and auditor pat tyson argued that many of the citations reflected improved record keeping mr tyson cited a university of michigan study that concluded that as many as  percent of workplace injuries go unreported he and the others say that improved procedures and record keeping result in a surge in the increase in injuries and illnesses temporarily they point out that virtually all of mcwanes injury rates both here and in china are below the industry average home  introduction  watch online  the penalty for

manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas to that end in  it opened a plant in chinas hebei province the company was named the excellent environmental protection facility of  by the
