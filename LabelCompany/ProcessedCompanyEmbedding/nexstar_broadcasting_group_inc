consent fees from cable and satellite operators that fox wanted its affiliates to pay the network would be  cents per subscriber during the first year of the affiliation agreement increasing to  cents

of earnings from retransmission consent agreements with cable and satellite operators as part of affiliation agreement renewals between station groups with affiliates whose affiliation contracts already expired and carrying the networks programming without a contractual agreement or were near expiration reportedly the amount from retransmission consent fees from cable and satellite operators that fox wanted its affiliates to pay the network would be  cents per subscriber during the first year of the affiliation agreement increasing to  cents by the fourth year president of affiliate sales and marketing for fox mike hopkins had said earlier in the year that the network would consider moving its affiliation to another market station as a last resort if existing affiliates did not agree
