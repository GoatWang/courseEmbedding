primarily marketed in the form of powder usually specialty carbon black grades and pellets specialty carbon black and rubber carbon black grades the handling systems differ substantially depending on the form of carbon black carbon black is mainly delivered in bulk silo trucks and rail cars semibulk containers flexible intermediate bulk containers and to a lesser extent in bags depending on the grade powder carbon black and some pelletized carbon black can be fluidized pneumatically using pressurized gas to effect mechanical motion this makes it possible to convey them in large quantities through a plant using high air volumes due to its low bulk density and relatively poor flow characteristics powder carbon black is usually not shipped in rigid vessels or silos but rather packaged in bags or flexible intermediate bulk containers pelletized carbon black is much easier to handle due to significantly better flow and conveying properties however it still requires precautions to prevent degradation during transportation carbon black powder has a low density which leads to higher transportation costs per volume measured in kmt of product shipped specialty carbon blacks can absorb these transportation costs allowing for a global reach rubber carbon blacks on the contrary tend to be sold on a regional basis as transportation costs are high relative to their sales prices and the quality of rubber carbon black may deteriorate when shipped over long distancesabout uscarbon blackabout carbon blackfeedstocktypes and gradeshandling of carbon

analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge

quarter  earnings conference call our agenda today is shown on slide  i will provide highlights for the first quarter of this year and comments on the performance of our two carbon black business segments i will then turn the call over to charles herlinger who’ll provide more detail on our financial results discuss our outlook for  after charles has finished i will review the progress we have made on major operational initiatives our strategy going forward and some comments on key performance metrics today we will then open the lines to take your questions starting with our first quarter highlights on slide  i am pleased to report that we are off to a strong start in  delivering a record quarterly adjusted ebitda doubledigit net profit growth and most recently after the close of the first quarter another repricing of our longterm debt to even further reduced interest costs demand in our businesses was solid with another outstanding quarter of volume growth for our specialty carbon black business rising  above last year rubber demand during the quarter was good in all regions we were especially pleased with the strong gains we saw in qingdao china while demand was good overall our rubber volumes declined mostly due to the closure of the rubber black facility in ambès france as we reduced sales of marginally profitable rubber grades and reduced the significant piece of manufacturing fixed costs our adjusted ebitda of € million increased  yearoveryear on strong performance in specialties and a recovering rubber carbon black business net income in the first quarter increased  or € million to € million pushing eps up by almost  to € per share and adjusted eps up by nearly  to € per share charles will speak further on the success we had in bringing our interest costs down last month this is yet another step in improving our liquidity slide  provides details on the volume and adjusted ebitda of each business our regional production coverage and key profitability trendlines our specialty carbon black business accounted for  of total volume and continues to provide more than half of total adjusted ebitda the improvement in the percentage of technical rubber grade products saw continuos decline reflecting our mix shift to highermargin grades and the impact of the closure of the french facility as the trendlines at the bottom of the slide illustrate we continued to experience recovery in our rubber black business due to operational improvements and some pricing release this year in specialty we saw some margin compression as a result of the time lag associated with price adjustments to deal with higher feedstock and a surge in freight cost to asia also as mentioned before we see some dilution of per ton margins as we expand our business in emerging markets such as south america and regionally produced product in china from our plant in qingdao our global sales volume footprint remains reasonably stable relative to this quarter last year turning to slide  our specialty carbon black business had a great quarter of growth with a  increase to  tons again outstripping our view of market growth the execution of our specialty strategy is going well as we expand our sales footprint product breadth and our capacity to meet demand volume growth was seen in all regions but it was especially strong in asia pacific due largely to volume gains with some help from the past due to of oil price specialty revenue increased  to € million versus € million in the prior year’s quarter gross profit was down € million to € million as a result of the issues i mentioned earlier including the lag in the timing of processing to deal with the rising feedstock cost some dilution of mix and increased freight costs gross profit per ton fell  to € and adjusted ebitda was down € million to € million turning to slide  we are pleased that the recovery continues in our rubber carbon black business overall volumes were stable with the exception of the marginal business we rationalized from our european portfolio when we closed the french plant at the end of the year  this led to an overall decline of  to  tons in the first quarter partially offsetting this impact was a doubledigit volume gain in china where our competitive position continues to strengthen on the basis of improved sales coverage and upgrading of our mix we would also like to point out that we’re seeing a tightening of emission controls in china which are pressuring the weaker suppliers and has led to reports of capacity declines in what has historically been an oversupply market the raw material passthrough effect of our mostly index business pushed first quarter revenue up  to € million from € million in last year’s first quarter gross profit increased  or € million to € million while the gross profit per metric ton improved  to € adjusted ebitda increased  to € million i’ll now turn the call over to charles for more details on our performance charles herlinger thanks jack good morning everyone turning to slide  and our consolidated first quarter results our volumes decreased slightly by  or  metric tons from the prior year to  tons due primarily to the pass through of higher feedstock costs revenue growth far exceeded volume development with revenue increasing  to € million in the quarter compared to € million last year our overall contribution margin improved  in the first quarter rising to € million versus € million in the prior year’s period driven by our rubber black business at the top waterfall chart on the right of on the slide shows the improvement in contribution margin was primarily driven by our volume growth with some favorable foreign exchange effects offset by price of mix effects to which we have already referred referring to the second waterfall chart on the righthand side the € million contribution margin improvement in the quarter was the main driver of adjusted ebitda growth partially offset by the fixed cost impact associated with the timing of repair and maintenance expenditure compared to the prior year quarter as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange impact on our fixed costs adjusted ebitda as a result grew by  to € million our adjusted ebitda margin of  declined  basis points versus last year’s fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of the pass through of higher oil costs on our revenues the last waterfall chart on the righthand side of this slide analyzes net income development which increased by € million due to the adjusted ebitda development quarteroverquarter offset partially by changes in depreciation tax and other items now turning to slide  which shows our first quarter cash flow dynamics and our key balance sheet metrics as of march   in our first quarter of  we generated € million from operations net of an increase in the quarter of net working capital by € million associated with rising oil prices and the timing of payments our uses of cash over the same period which include capital expenditures interest payments required debt repayments and dividends totaled € million as a result cash decreased during the quarter by € million with cash on hand we nonetheless voluntarily repaid a further € million of debt in the quarter turning to our balance sheet as of march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of € million compared to € million on december   the company’s noncurrent indebtedness as of yearend was € million with net debt at € million which represents a leverage ratio of x ltm adjusted ebitda our goal remains to move towards low x levered over the next couple of years or so through a combination of adjusted ebitda growth and deleveraging as a reminder the total debt chart on the bottom righthand corner of this slide illustrates that some of our debt is denominated in us dollars but reported in euros and that’s gets revalued every quarter as these currencies fluctuate moving to slide  which presents our full year guidance and further cash flow detail regarding base business requirements and capital allocation at this point in the year we’re maintaining full year guidance for financial year  of adjusted ebitda between € million and € million this is based on the assumptions of volume growth will be in line with current gdp expectations and that oil prices and exchange rates will be at the level seen during the first quarter of  from base capital expenditures our guidance is consistent with the past of approximately € million but with the total rising to over € million due to the selffinancing capital expenditures associated with the consolidation of our plants in korea please bear in mind we expect that the cash proceeds derived from the sale of our plant site in seoul will more than offset all capital expenditures and other costs associated with this consolidation project we expect depreciation costs of € million and for amortization € million our tax rate expectation on pretax income is a rate of  moving to the righthand side of slide  and our analysis of our annual cash requirements you will see that our estimates now reflect a reduction in interest payments as a result of a further repricing of our term loan debt which we have just announced in summary our lenders consented to reduce our debt service cost by some of € million on a current annualized basis relating both to our euro and us dollardenominated outstanding term loans the euro tranche of our loans will reflect a  basis point reduction in the margin to  plus a reduction of the euribor floor from  to  whereas the margin on the dollar tranche of our loans will reflect a  basis point reduction to  other provisions of our term loan credit agreement remain unchanged this action as well as the further voluntary repayment of some € million of our term loan debt in the quarter further underscores our confidence in our ability to maintain our capital allocation priorities of supporting dividend payments investing in optimization capex and continuing in due course to delever i will now turn the call back to jack who will comment on our operational priorities and other matters before we head to qa jack clem thank you charles many of you have already seen the detailed outline on slide  it restates our priorities which directionally remain unchanged but are adjusted for new challenges and opportunities as we move through the year we remain focused on driving the improvement in our product portfolio and matching our capacity footprint to this better mix improving efficiencies through actions such as implementing improved reactors and waste heat recapture while looking for the best uses of our capital including builton acquisitions that closely match our competencies our focus on managing the balance sheet for strong cash generation and our capital allocation approach remain unchanged finally at the risk of stating while many of you already know i’ll refer to the new slide slide  it shows how orion has consistently delivered growth while judiciously using its high rate of cash conversion to pay a healthy dividend and significantly reduce leverage it speaks well to the efforts of this team over the past few years in making orion the successful business in closing rising energy prices we experienced in the first quarter of this year demonstrated the complementary nature of orion’s two businesses in spite of the spike in energy cost our performance improved and we set another quarterly adjusted ebitda record we believe this shows that our strategy is sound and our business model is resilient and positioned well to deal with our markets we wish to thank our investors for their confidence in orion our customers for their business and our employees for all their hard work with that operator please open the line up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time we will be conducting the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of kevin hocevar with north coast research please proceed with your question kevin cleary this is actually kevin cleary on for kevin in the press release you had mentioned industry being tight – or at least tightening particularly in the specialty grades and the chemical rubber grades so wonder would your plans really address this tightness and do you have any plans raising pricing given the tight environment or do you have any plans to add capacity to meet expected growth and demand jack clem we typically don’t comment on pricing in these kinds of calls with the tightness that we got right now particularly that we saw going into  in europe as we commented before we were able to see some pricing in some of these areas but for the most part the rubber businesses as you probably know pricing is for the most part set for the year at this point in time and that’s specified all i would comment on that for the time being the tightness associated with the – some of the specialty grades that we’ve got right now and we’ve been in the process of debottlenecking and doing some movement of capacity from some of the facilities that we got into our specialty i think you probably are aware of the fact that we commented on the conversion of our rubber line in korea last year and moving that capacity more into specialty and in the meantime we continue to do a variety of different debottlenecks including some that we made announcements on such as the one in sweden it’s been done recently or in the process of being done currently started recently to debottleneck the specialty areas as well kevin cleary okay good and separately from that i was wondering if you guys felt there’s any prebuying in the period in any of the specialty grades particularly in polymer end markets and if so what type of impact they have in the quarter and what type of destocking impacts that you may have looking forward jack clem there is a little evidence out there that there was some prebuy not anything large from our customers what prebuy that we did believe we saw or at least have some evidence of was the prebuy by ultimately the customers of our third customers it seems like there was some prebuying by dealers as the third guys had announced price increases affecting the second quarter so the first quarter was actually i think a bit pushed up by the volumes associated with our customers’ customers but with respect to our specialty area there might have been a bit of that going on but typically you don’t see a lot in these markets especially not in the what we consider are more premium ends kevin cleary great thank you for the detail operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan please proceed with your question jeff zekauskas thanks very much your working capital was up a lot in the first quarter and are you going to have a working capital deficit in  or will things right themselves in the course of the year charles herlinger good morning jeff it’s charles yes your right is up it is up because oil is up jeff effectively about  – on average about  a barrel and we’ve published this rule of thumb about our estimate of what change in oil price will do to our net working capital in the range of € million to € million of change in working capital depending – for a  per barrel change in the oil price and effectively we’ve seen about  working its way through working capital it is – the effect is a little bit higher than you would expect to your question ie receivables and inventory have gone up a little bit disproportionately more to payables and that is just simply the timing of payables at the end of last year and now that will right itself certainly expect that to happen in q of course if oil remains at this elevated level compared to the last quarter of last year then we would expect to see some consumption – overall consumption of working capital due to those changes – changes driven by oil jeff zekauskas so what happened is yes i guess just to transition to a slightly different question so oil has gone up and now it’s come in – or it’s come in to a degree in your specialty black business you are squeezed in terms of your margins because you are capturing the raw material inflation and now you are trying to lift the prices but now oil is coming back down did – does that create complications for you or do you think you can sort of get your margins moving in the right direction in the second quarter jack clem jeff good morning by the way it’s always a bit of a balance when you have these sort of things going on or going one way or going the other way we – i mean as soon as we saw the oil prices moving up in the first quarter and the end of fourth quarter last year and during the first quarter we initiated a series of price movements in order to address that and some of what you see there is a bit of a margin compression that’s created by some of the quarterly adjustments that we have that were racked in sales just simply because of the quarterly adjustments others are – simply a price initiative that are underway right now i mean it remains to be seen i mean and quite frankly oil going up supports the argument for price increase oil going down actually kind of undermines that a bit but also works its way into better margins so we’re fairly confident that we’re going to be able to get back to where we were before in some of these areas particularly with the quarterly adjustments that we mentioned bit earlier so i think it just gives the team time to work on this and see what they can accomplish out in the field jeff zekauskas why was the margin capture so much better in rubber blacks than it was in specialty blacks jack clem i mean there is different factors of working there on the first place we actually will end the  as we commented with some base price increases when we’re able to get some traction in various places around the world that we’ve spoken to in the past and we’re able to push the base prices up a bit in those areas so i mean that’s one of the big factors that’s playing there and the other is we’ve substantially improved the mix of our business with the movement away from some of the more commoditytype materials and of course you’ve got this additional onetime advantage of taking out those fixed costs associated with that french plant i’m going to tell different mechanisms of moving there i would – just as long as i’m speaking to you jeff i would like to point out on that first question on net working capital while that’s risen it’s really purely a factor of this movement in oil price and energy price the days of our working capital are actually running below the average of where we were last year so the team continues to do a good job managing days at working capital price so it’s just a price cost effectives waving its way through jeff zekauskas what’s the overhead that came out from the closure of the ambès plant in the first quarter and are there larger effects later in the year or it’s the sort of the maximum quarterly amount charles herlinger it’s about € million of overheard that came out jeff on an annual basis we’ve closed the plant as you – i think may recall right at the end of last year so we expect the € million at least on the cost line boost to the rubber numbers and to jack’s earlier comment in  as a result of the closure we did – as we’ve talked about in previous calls shed some product some we’ve retained in different locations in europe of the product we shed some of it was marginally profitable at a contribution margin level and some of it wasn’t even that so most of that € million drops through to the bottom line in  jeff zekauskas so on a – so how much would the first quarter amount be if it’s € million annually charles herlinger it’s a quarter about € million jeff zekauskas it’s a quarter of that yes okay great thank you so much operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of mike leithead with barclays please proceed with your question mike leithead hey guys good morning charles herlinger good morning mike mike leithead just wanted to dig a bit into the rubber volumes for a second if i’m reading your slides correctly it looks like the business excluding the france shutdown was relatively flat is that correct i guess you guys called out china up double digits and there being some prebuy activity so i guess i’m just trying to triangulate all the moving pieces in the quarter here jack clem yes i think you’re close and for the most part we did see a nice gain in the facility in china as it’s a small part it’s not as if it displaces a lot just other places around the world but for the most part i’d say if you take away the loss of the french contribution in the first quarter the remainder of the world really is about the best thing mike leithead got it okay and then i guess piggybacking on one of jeff’s questions earlier pretty sizable improvement in your rubber dollar per ton earnings this quarter and then look at that – if you look at that improvements how much did you say is the trivial order just a mix benefit from shutting down the lowermargin french stuff versus kind of benefits from your restructuring and efficiency efforts to the rest of your asset base charles herlinger yes it’s a little difficult to slice i mean it’s – we hesitate to give that much detail in terms of slicing i would say the larger contributions are the movements that we got and the relief that we got in some pricing i would say and i failed to mention this to jeff a little bit earlier with the rise in the price of oil in the first quarter of  we actually gained quite a bit more on our efficiency programs i mean quite frankly when the oil goes up we benefit from some of the efficiency programs that we put in place well and so we saw a nice boost to that as well but you’re talking about this mix improvement things somewhere kind of in the low singledigit numbers for quarter mike leithead thanks guys appreciate it operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of mike sison with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question mike sison hi guys nice start to the year charles herlinger mike thank you mike sison in terms of especially carbon black volumes could you maybe talk about some of the areas that you’re seeing the strength by end markets plastics are good for you last year coatings and then do you think it’s – that type of level of growth is sustainable as the year unfolds charles herlinger we continue to kind of surprise ourselves with this doubledigit growth in the specialty area we’ve got several quarters out of the last several quarters which we’ve actually exceeded what we anticipated so i’ve kind of given up a notion that this is going to relax back into the midsingle digits i think probably  quarter after quarter probably not but probably something in the highsingle digits is still where i stay with this notion with respect to end markets just looking at where we really exceeded i mean we had a very strong asia pacific performance but we had growth actually either doubledigit or high singledigit growth in practically all of our end regions so we were quite pleased with it and we have to remember that when we talk about volume in this particular market it’s usually slanted toward polymer because polymer is the high volume component of our specialty business coatings it’s a great business for us as you know but it’s a smaller volume so our coatings business was good we’re appreciative of that fact is though it’s not a huge contributor to the volumes wing as polymers are bringing in sort of in between there and that was – those markets were all very strong in the first quarter mike sison great and then if you think about the – you highlighted  sort of areas that depressed gross profit for specialty blacks in the quarter are they all about equal i know you did comment regarding oil going up and down but there’s mix there’s freight did they all have about an equal impact and with the other two may be subside faster than the challenge we had with oil jack clem no given the oil issue was the heavy hitter there and it would be the largest of those  areas mike sison okay great and then when you think about your outlook for the year though for ebitda in total do you see especially carbon black’s growing ebitda this year despite kind of a slower start charles herlinger i think we don’t – as you know we don’t guide on individual segments for the year as a whole we have our game plan in terms of what we are doing and obviously need to do as jack’s outlined to jeff’s question earlier obviously partially depends on what oil does and so we were confident it’s going to have a very – another very good year that is clear to us but beyond that we wouldn’t want to call an individual segment for the entire year mike sison great thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of john roberts with ubs please proceed with your question john roberts nice quarter i apologize for the background noise i will press here to ask my questions i believe china has a major program to put black plastic drainage piping in is that – i know you don’t have a big china business but you maybe export into china for your other asian operations is that a significant factor in your comment you just made about asia being especially strong in specialty black and then secondly i know you’re indemnified on the epa discussions that you’re having in the us but with the change in the administration in the us should we expect that to say significantly longer period of time to work out jack clem good questions john i mean asia pacific is a growth area for us it’s certainly been a strong area for us in polymer this black plastic type application you’re talking about has a lot of different stripes we’re very strong in that in the europe – european market in the us market particularly in the chinese market it’s an area for us it’s a focus where we have seen significant growth in asia pacific in the polymer area is more in the synthetic fiber market which is a higher quality – it’s a very special grade whereas pipe we love the pipe business and we participate in it strongly in our other two regions it’s not though really the big heavy hitter although it will be one as we begin to convert the facility in qingdao to upgrade its capabilities to attack this area versus the rubber area that it’s historically attacked in the past so yes it’s a good business we know it very well we know the customers we know the applications so if we’re not already there which we may be in some part we’ll certainly be a big player in that area given our heft in the other regions that we serve i mean it’s a good question on the epa we are – as you say we’ve been in constructive negotiations with those guys for quite some time washington in itself is probably all people in line realize is in a bit of turmoil right now with the trump administration he has different ideas about what to do he’s got – certainly he has different approaches with respect to different areas of the epa apparently in his recent spending bill the epa didn’t see the cuts that was proposed originally so i think right now we’re kind of in a holding period as the trump administration point these to the epa get a grip on this how they want to approach not only these big issues like clean power plants and waterways of america but also how they’re going to handle some of the issues like ours which falls into some of the enforcement areas of epa in the climate of justice so long answer john but i think right now we’re just sort of in a that continued dialogue to see where they wish to take these types of activities john roberts great thank you operator operator instructions thank you our next question comes from the line of art indiscernible  with freecorp please proceed with your question unidentified analyst i wanted to ask a little bit about korea and maybe you can just remind us the timing of when that project should be finished up jack clem yes that’s a good question this stays as a background what we’re doing in korea right now is we are in the process of closing the facility that’s in the suburb of seoul actually in incheon place in an area we call bupyeong this was smaller the two plants that we have in korea and the facilities and the capabilities there are being migrated down to the southern tip of korea in our facility called yeosu the endpoint of this is going to be a reduction in the overall capacity that comes out of more the commodity state of – or the commodity grades of rubber that we produce there will actually come out of it with a higher capacity in specialty capabilities particularly on the high end of materials that we produce there in korea that’s already underway we’ve already began to spin capital to do that with conversion of different facilities i mean this is well publicized we’re in conversations currently with the local government and with our unions about the closure about the severance about the rezoning of the area ultimately because the notion is we would sell the real estate there and as charles mentioned earlier in a fashion that would be able to self finance the capital that we’re spending to make the move down there it’s underway currently right now with a target date to complete the conversion from a facility capability the middle of  has a target we have frequent discussions on this in fact just this week so – that’s the schedule that we outlined earlier we continue to be on that schedule as we speak today the actual sell of the land probably will go a little bit longer than that just simply because doing that sort of thing and the korean government is a bit bureaucratic it will take us a while to do it but we’re confident i mean given the price of real estate in that area and the notions that we’ve gotten from real estate developers if this is something that can be done in that time period charles herlinger to that point art we could speed up the sale and not wait for potential rezoning and sacrifice again on the sale of the property which we don’t want to do we obviously go to find the sweet spot between getting it done efficiently and maximizing the return for shareholders so that’s simply what we’re trying to balance but in any case i think this is worth emphasizing this is a – it’s an unusual project because it is completely selffinancing in the sense through enough balance sheet it is on balance sheet but undervalued asset the land it is valued obviously on a historical cost basis and its current value is much higher so it’s an unusual project in the sense that the sale of land will finance the whole thing capital and the cost that go with actually achieving the move unidentified analyst and the – what are the expected or the operating cost savings from that i guess change and i think the french facility closure saving roughly € million a year going forward is this in the same magnitude must be a little bit more or a little bit less charles herlinger yes it’s at least in the magnitude of the french savings probably in practice it should be more so that is – it’s  plus but our main focus right now because this is such a – forgive the use of the term no brainer to do our main focus is in getting this done and then optimizing the production footprint in getting it done but it will be a significant drop to the bottom line improvement to the drop bottom line because of the cost structure obviously two plants into one but it also allows us as jack mentioned earlier to focus on in one world class size plant into the sweet spot of the products we are as a company focused on specialty and these technical rubber grades with better margins jack clem and art i mean without going into the detail the southern facility the yeosu facility is inherently a more efficient facility because of its capability to be in industrial complex with cogeneration and access to different variety of feedstocks and suction and as we are doing these conversions of course we’re not just going back with the same type of equipment but equipment that’s more advanced higher efficiency so there’s some real gains not only in just the reduction of fixed costs and the presence there bupyeong but also an uptick in our overall efficiencies as we make these conversions unidentified analyst got it and i guess as i recall i think you would – maybe said before that the capex associated – the cost associated with this is like € million to € million or € million to € million or something like that charles herlinger yes high s unidentified analyst got it so then the presumption would be this land when it sold would be something in excess of that in loan probably you don’t want to put a number on it to limit when it could be sold for would be my guess jack clem no that’s exactly right unidentified analyst okay we thank you very much thanks for all your hard work in all the great results jack clem thank you art operator thank you mr clem there are no further questions i’ll turn the floor back to you for final remarks jack clem okay well thanks for the good questions today we appreciate your attendance your good capabilities today it was good talking to everybody we hope you’ll agree that we’re off to a good start in  we position ourselves pretty well with this first quarter it’s always nice to have a successful quarter when you start a year like this we’ve got three more to go it’s going to be kind of a challenge as everyone of these years have been but we think we’re well positioned for we got a good team in place a good strategy that’s executing well at this point the market’s overall seem to be in our favor at this time so we look forward to bringing you the information about second quarter in our next call so with that we’ll sign off and thank you very much charles herlinger thank you operator thank you this concludes today’s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time
