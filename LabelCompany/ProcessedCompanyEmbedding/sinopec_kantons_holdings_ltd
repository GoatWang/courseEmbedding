speed success long only deep value eventdriven arbitragesummarythis is a defensive stock with valuable midstream oil and gas assetsit is undervalued on a valuation basis compared with oil and gas midstream companies in the usthe company benefits from refinery deregulation as well as one belt one roadthe oil and gas market changed in  when the price of crude oil halved it has been struggling to recover with the global supply surplus and the shale oil revolution in the us not surprisingly the oil price crash led to share price declines in many oil stocks however it should be noted that not all oil companies profits are directly tied to the oil price for example companies that transport oil via pipelines generate fees from volume rather than the oil price in the us these companies are typically called master limited partnerships mlps some companies in this space are kinder morgan nysekmi enterprise products nyseepd etc unfortunately many of these mlps in the us are no longer undervalued with most of them having pricetoearnings ratios over  times however a few of these opportunities still exist overseas in this article i will discuss a company listed in hong kong called sinopec kantons holdings limited otcsnpkf otcpkspkoy sinopec kantons is indirectly controlled by sinopec corp sehk  nysesnp by its  stake via a wholly owned subsidiary called china international united petroleum  chemicals co ltd unipec unipec is the international oil trading arm of sinopec corp responsible for procuring oil internationally for all of sinopec corps refineries thus due to the size of sinopec corp it is one of the worlds largest oil trading firms as discussed on sinopec kantons company website sinopec corp performed an internal restructuring in  and positioned sinopec kantons to become a worldclass petrochemical storage and logistics company operationally they essentially become the logistic arm supporting unipecs globally crude oil trading after seven years of transformation sinopec kantons assets and businesses are now  midstream making it equivalent to a us mlp however i believe markets still do not fully understand this transition and have been greatly undervaluing sinopec kantons since the oil price crash below i discuss why i believe it should deserve a higher valuation defensive stock with valuable midstream oil and gas assets the financial statements of this company are a pain to go through because sinopec kantons has a lot of joint ventures that dont consolidate into the balance sheet so its difficult to understand the full picture of the assets luckily the footnotes websites and other reports do provide a good amount of information on its assets piecing everything together sinopec kantons assets are mainly divided into four categories crude oil terminals  sinopec kantons has interests in seven crude oil terminals located along chinas coastline these terminals generate income mainly through charging a fixed fee per ton of crude oil loadingunloading this business is similar to the commissions charged by a stock broker oil storage  sinopec kantons has interests in several crude oil storage tanks located throughout europe the middle east and china that generate income by leasing out portions to other oil companies this model is very similar to owning a commercial building and renting out sections of it as offices pipelines  sinopec kantons owns a km natural gas pipeline that runs across four provinces from inner mongolia to shandong as well as some crude oil pipelines via its terminals these pipelines generates income by charging a fee on the amount of goods eg crude oil and natural gas being transmitted this is similar to a highway toll booth that charges by the distance traveled vessels  sinopec kantons is constructing eight vessels that will be leased out for  years to sinopec corp each vessel generates a fixed fee per day this business is similar to a car rental service the above assets make up  of sinopec kantons revenues and almost all of its net profits none of these assets directly depend on the oil price some of them are volume driven which means they do indirectly benefit from a low oil price because of higher demand which increases volumes this is evident from the doubledigit increase in volumes through its crude oil terminals since the oil price crash from an asset prospective sinopec kantons is equivalent to a typical us oil and gas midstream mlp lets see how they compare from a valuation standpoint very undervalued on a valuation basis compared to oil and gas midstream mlps in the us valuation between sinopec kantons and us oil and gas midstream mlps name  ticker  rev og midstream net assets pe sinopec kantons   x kinder morgan   x enterprise prod   x oneok nyseoks   x williams nysewpz   x  end of year net assets pe calculated based on the share price of may   source bloomberg terminal subscription required as shown in the above table sinopec kantons valuation is two to three times below that of its us peers ive only listed the largest us mlps as indicated by net asset size smaller mlps actually have higher priceearnings ratios due to potentially higher growth so this is a more conservative comparison furthermore sinopec kantons is pretty much the largest midstreamonly public company in china due to the more illiquid market chinese midstream assets generally are valued lower than similar assets in the us this results in lower net assets even though the revenue generated from the assets might be higher i will illustrate this point using sinopec kantons crude oil terminals extremely lucrative crude oil terminals about  of the revenues and  of the net profits are generated from sinopec kantons crude oil terminal assets these assets have performed remarkably well since their acquisitions in  net earnings is calculated as the total earnings from each terminal multiplied by the percentage ownership of sinopec kantons at the end of  return is calculated as the  net earningsinitial purchase price  net assets are used for huade petrochemical since it was acquired prior to going public source company filings it is worth noting that these assets have superior returns qingdao shihua has over  return meaning that just the earnings from this year are enough to cover its entire purchase price consequently if these assets were sold in the market today assuming a conservative x price to earnings multiple the consideration price would be around hk billion us billion which is higher than the market value of the entirety of sinopec kantons this means that at the current price you are buying the oil terminals at a fair value with all the other assets pipelines vessels etc included for free after reviewing this company in detail i can see that there are definitely a few reasons why it remains undervalued its financial statements are very hard to understand due to the high number of joint ventures that dont consolidate into the balance sheet this is especially concerning when they have a lot of projectfinancing leverage that are offbalancesheet there arent that many similar companies listed in china so the investor base isnt as strong dividend payments are low it is controlled by a stateowned enterprise like sinopec which might not look after minority investors looking at the list above i believe reasons  and  are just noise that create opportunities for astute investors reason  is currently valid as the dividend yield is quite low around  but their board just increased dividends by  this year with plans of future increases reason  is a valid macro concern that should warrant some discount while i dont think sinopec kantons should be valued as high as a us mlp a valuation twice as low is way too low for one of the largest mlps in china supporting documents pdf hkarpdf hkxlsx disclosure i amwe are long snpkf i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not
