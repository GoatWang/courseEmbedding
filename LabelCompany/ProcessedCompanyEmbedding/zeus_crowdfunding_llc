–what is the difference between zeus crowdfunding and private money hard money or bridge money the term private money is typically associated with conservative nontraditional financing provided by a borrower’s family and friends the term hard money is typically associated with high interest rate assetbased lenders the term bridge money is typically associated with nontraditional temporary loans provided by banks zeus crowdfunding is a unique alternative due to our very fast funding process low interest rates and fees our conservative riskadverse standards and participation by individual zcrowd investors in our program –do you need perfect credit for zeus crowdfunding yes and no our clients have an average score above  credit scores and credit history are great tools for assessing the likelihood of repayment but unlike a traditional bank we consider the following additional factors that may offset less than perfect credit  what is the overall quality location and ltv of the property in question  will the borrower be pledging any other real estate as collateral or protection  how much liquid cash does the borrower have  how much money is the borrower going to contribute to the transaction we consider these factors before making a final determination for any borrower regardless of credit score and credit history we do not finance solely against the property or solely against the borrower and we take an overall common sense approach to both –why are you able to fund these projects when a bank or hardprivate money lender cannot or will not most banks and hardprivate money lenders are unable to finance these projects because of regulatory or guideline restrictions and insufficient processes zeus crowdfunding is not a mortgage banking entity or a depository so they are excluded from these requirements in fact banks and mortgage lenders are a key source of referrals to zeus crowdfunding –how do you know the value of the property we have a third party provider assess the value and condition of the property prior to funding the value is typically underwritten a second time internally prior to prefunding this is one of our keys to maintaining more than adequate leverage –what is the typical transaction structure zeus crowdfunding is provided as real estate financing collateralized against the quicksale value of the property in question these transactions are funded in the stlien position meaning that in the event of a default the zcrowd members are the first creditors to receive remuneration zeus crowdfunding is based on a percentage of the quicksale value of the subject property this is called the loantovalue or ltv ratio and is typically between  of the value of the property for the purposes of determining an ltv the word “value” is defined as the value of the property after the necessary renovations to market the property at its highest and best use this is often referred to as the afterrepairvalue or arv –how much money can i borrow for my project typically we fund between  and  of the arv after repair value of the subject property for existing structures the average for builders is  with a higher arv you may pay higher points –how much do i need to have in assets you need the greater of the two k or x the cost of repairs  closing costs –can i use property as an asset yes you can use property as an asset if it is owned free and clear and is located in an area we serve –what will my closing costs be closing costs will include  months of insurance on the subject property the first monthly payment and about k or x the cost of repairs –why do i need to pay a whole year’s worth of homeowners insurance if the loan is for just  months this practice protects you from possible lapses also most insurance companies will refund you a portion of what you paid or give it to you as a credit –if i had this much money why would i want to borrow or crowdfund the benefit is to be able to use “other people’s money” while keeping your money as free working capital speak to your cpa about possible tax benefits of borrowing for repairs and renovations –is there a limit to the number of properties i can have no however if you plan to keep the property you will need to show  months of reserves for the piti principle interest taxes and insurance for all investment properties as well as  months of hoa fees for all properties if you have more than  properties financed you will also need to have a credit score above  –i want to borrow money to build on land i own can you fund that yes the percent of arv will be approximately  ideally the land should be worth twice as much as the structure –what happens if i sell the property before my month term is up no problem there are no prepayment penalties additionally you will only be charged interest on money you actually borrowed so you would not be charged interest on any renovation money you have not drawn –how much does it cost to make a draw typically the cost of the required inspection is approximately  although you may request draws as frequently as you wish you may want to consider batching draw requests and submitting less frequently so as to incur fewer inspection charges –why do you need so many documents actually only a copy of your license and bank statements is required however the prefunded amount will likely be less and the cost to borrow higher the more information you can provide the easier it is to provide you with the very best deal –can i get gap financing yes if you need financing on your next purchase while waiting on the sale of your property our crowdfunding specialists can help you arrange the necessary bridge funding –can foreign nationals be borrowers with zeus crowdfunding yes of course it will depend on the deal itself proper identification and verifiable assets arv for foreign nationals will likely be about  to  –what do i need to get fast track day funding preparation and organization is the key to fast track funding to get fast track funding you need to have the following in place the day you request fast track an existing survey done within the past  years clear title paperwork all requested client docs uploaded by the day you ask for fast track funding an expedited appraisal request to your borrower specialist requires an extra feebe sure your borrower specialist knows up front that fast track is your goal –what do you need to buy property at an auction there are  things you need to buy property an auction if you aren’t paying cash first the auction needs to allow for financing by hard money second you need a proof of funds letter from zeus crowdfunding simply ask a borrower specialist at zeus crowdfunding for a proof of funds letter for the amount you’re willing to spend on the bid it’s that easy –how do i get  of costs funded if the money you need acquisition price  repair costs  fees equals or is less than the money you qualify for funding amount based on the percent of the property’s appraised after repair value you essentially get  of your project financed –what does it take to get that  interest rate blended interest rates as low as  are possible on buy  hold combo projects short term financing for the acquisition and repairs converting to long term financing for the very best terms one would need  • a credit score greater than •  of the project costs or  in reserves after closing whichever is greater• a maximum loan amount of • acquisition cost repairs costs and closing costs not exceeding  of the appraised value ––how long has zeus crowdfunding been in business our founding company zeus mortgage bank is ranked as one of the fastest growing companies in the united states by inc magazine and the houston business journal we have been working with borrowers and investors for over a decade and have funded over m in offline crowdfunding transactions now with zeus crowdfunding we are bringing that vast experience and expertise online we’re using the latest technology and we’re making those advantages available to even more borrowers and investors –what happens if a project fails that rarely happens zeus crowdfunding primarily funds in the first lien position between  of the property’s “quicksalevalue” and only funds to very well or uniquely qualified borrowers however if a nonperforming asset is acquired it will be immediately stabilized and marketed for resale the excess equity typically offsets the investment return and costs in many cases these resale opportunities can create additional unexpected returns in the very rare occurrence of a shortfall zeus crowdfunding uses reserves to close the transaction for the individual investors who selected the guaranteed investment option at the time of investment the guaranteed investment option guarantees the investor protection from loss of principal –what’s the difference between guaranteed and nonguaranteed investments guaranteed investments pay a lower rate of return but guarantee the investor protection from loss of principal nonguaranteed investments pay a higher rate of return but the principal is more at risk that said zeus crowdfunding primarily funds in the first lien position and is very thorough in their due diligence after all we fund every project before we offer it to the investors and we don’t receive any origination fees until investors are paid –what does semiliquid mean can i get my investment back early the investor should anticipate a  month holding period based on their selected investment however the average zeus crowdfunding investment is complete well before maturity and our current average project only lasts approximately  months should an investor require early withdrawalredemption the zeus crowdfunding semiliquid withdrawal option™ takes approximately  weeks and includes prorata yields or discounts investors can cashout or withdraw their full or partial investment at anytime with our semiliquid withdrawal option™ –will my money be shared or pooled or mixed with other investors in several investments each investor is paired directly to a single borrower and a single property and is not part of a pool the investor’s funds are used for a specific transaction ie a specific borrower and a specific property and their funds are never pooled and shared with other investor funds on multiple projects –who is the typical investor we do the investing for you so you don’t have too investors who see the value in diversification leverage and real estate but are not prepared or trained to locate underwrite and service their own private loans align with zeus crowdfunding for the concierge investment experience we underwrite and prefund every project so our investors can enjoy true semiliquid passive returns on their investments –who can be an investor accredited investors investors who make a minimum of  per year or have m in assets can invest as little as  per project up to the total amount being funded –how much does it cost me to invest if you are not yet accredited you may see a small charge for accreditation processing other than that there is no charge to the zcrowd investors simply invest as little as  in the projects of your choice and start earning interest payments right away –what’s the story on the funding bonus how do i get a  bonus investors who invest  or more in a single transaction on one property are eligible for a funding bonus if you invest  to  in that single transaction you receive a bonus equal to  of the amount you invested for example if you invest  in a single transaction on one property your bonus would be  if you invest  or more in that single transaction on one property you receive  of the amount you invested as a bonus for example if you invest  in a single transaction on one property your bonus would be  the funding bonus is paid when the project is completed and you receive your principal payoff ––what is pci

origination fee but unlike any other lender zeus crowdfunding collects the origination fee after the project is complete and the borrower pays off the loanthis unique arrangement means that  it takes less cash upfront for the borrower to close  the borrower doesn’t have to wait on investors to get funded and can get started on their project right away  zcrowd investors don’t have to wait for a
