listing agents use a comparative market analysis cma tool to determine the asking price of a properly so when i came to list unit  at  montana ave billings i really struggled to find comparable homes well with determination frustration and some divine inspiration i settled on an asking price of  for the  sq ft unit so far weve attracted a good bit of interest but more surprisingly weve seen similar homes his the market in recent weeks looking at those home in comparison to my listing im happy to say my price per square foot is highly competitive and we should be getting an offer soon so to return to my original statement it does look as if things are beginning to come alive in the downtown residential property market it would be great to see the city come to life outside of business hours im sure it will be a busy vibrant place for people who dont want the ubiquitous suburban rancher please check out my listing and let me know if this kind of lifestyle would suit you we will also
