performance results have many inherent limitations some of which are described below no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in fact there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program one of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight in addition hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading for example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results there are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results  jurisdictional information and geographic limitations

throughout several market environments fund literature  forms news media  events you are hereequinox funds managed futures during equity crises—an update insights managed futures during equity crises—an update most individual and institutional portfolios generally have substantial often  or larger positions in equities and equityrelated asset classes because the “risk” of these asset classes is generally quite high the majority of the total risk of these portfolios is driven by equities hence most financial crises almost by definition involve large declines in equities accompanied by similar trends in other markets as most investors resort to panic selling of risky assets all at the same time generally market volatility also spikes during these times many equity market crises are also characterized by a flight to safety with increased investments into assets such as the us dollar precious metals and us treasury securities these strong price trends and the accompanying volatility expansion can often prove to be an environment in which managed futures have thrived the managed futures asset class has acquired a reputation among investors for providing what is known as crisis alpha – the ability to generate returns at a time of market crisis the latest example of this was the period december  – january  when the sp ® total return index lost − while the vix® index a forwardlooking measure of equity market volatility spiked by more than  increasing from about  at the end of november  to more than  at the end of january  the “crisis” in this instance has been attributed to mario draghi’s underwhelming stimulus measures announced in early december perhaps exacerbated by the us fed’s first rate hike albeit widely anticipated and long overdue since  over this period the barclay btop ® index which is often used as a proxy for the managed futures asset class gained approximately  several commentators including us have addressed and analyzed this characteristic of managed futures during other past crises here we update those results using a slightly different and perhaps more “rigorous” definition of a crisis we look for periods since  when the vix® index has either shown an increase of  or greater or has reached an absolute level of at least  we then try to identify the qualitative reason for such an increase eg the events of  the greek crisis etc next we examine the returns on the sp ® total return index equities and the btop ® index managed futures over those periods   our results are summarized below and speak for themselves in every single one of these crises as we define them equity markets trade lower ranging from − to from − managed futures by way of contrast show only three periods with negative returns ranging from −

succinctly in the paper by kaminski cited earlier as follows managed futures strategies tend to be highly liquid and trade almost exclusively in futures markets with minimal credit exposure hence they may be less susceptible to the illiquidity and credit traps that are generally prevalent during equity market crisis   they are dominated by systematic trading strategies with no long equity bias hence they tend to be less susceptible to behavioral biases and the emotionbased or panicdriven selling that is often triggered when large losses are experienced   they trade across a wide range of sectors and markets and can hold either long or short exposures depending on perceived price trends hence they have the potential to profit from both uptrends and downtrends across multiple global futures markets our evidence is based purely on historical data and there is no assurance that these patterns will necessarily repeat during future crises further managed futures as an asset class tend to have low correlations to most other asset classes which means they have the potential to provide diversification benefits by lowering the overall risk of a portfolio however they should not be viewed as “hedges” because a hedge is traditionally defined as an asset that has a high negative correlation   footnotes please refer to the glossary for definitions of terms and indices dr ajay
