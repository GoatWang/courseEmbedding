object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

telecommunications inc advancenewhouse communications cox cable communications inc and company founder and ceo john hendricks beginnings the company known as discovery communications inc traces its roots to  when a university of alabama history graduate named john hendricks founded the cable educational network inc in maryland the new companys goal was to help present informational and documentary programming on television hendricks a west virginia native had earlier founded a consulting firm that assisted producers of educational videos with marketing in  after raising  million hendrickss small company launched a new cable television network which was dubbed the discovery channel discovery which initially broadcast a variety of licensed documentaries but no original programming was available in only  households the new channels revenues were small and within six months hendricks owed  million to the british broadcasting corporation bbc but had only  in the bank desperate for funding he sought out new investors alhough he was turned down by the large entertainment companies he approached he was able to convince a group of cable operators led by telecommunications inc tci cox cable communications inc and newhouse broadcasting corp to take a flyer on the network retaining ownership of  percent for himself tci whose stake later was transferred to liberty media owned  percent with newhouse later known as advancenewhouse and cox holding a quarter each the company now was able to pay its creditors and the new investors also boosted discoverys audience base when they added the channel to their systems by its first anniversary in june  discovery counted seven million subscribers over the next several years the company broadened its range of programming with events such as the february  broadcast of  hours of live russian television gaining the company wider media interest discovery also lengthened its schedule to  hours per day from  during the year by  discoverys growing subscriber base had hit  million the following year saw the company offer its first overseas cable service with some  subscribers in the united kingdom and scandinavia receiving discovery channel europe in addition  was the year discovery commissioned its first original programming having heretofore relied exclusively on material from outside sources among them the bbc one new show assignment discovery was a daily onehour program designed to be used in school classrooms in  discovery expanded its overseas operations to israel and began to sell videos through the newly created discovery interactive library unit the company which had employed only  when the channel first went on the air now had a staff of more than   acquisition of the learning channel in june  the company purchased the learning channel tlc for  million tlc had  million subscribers at the time of the acquisition but was struggling financially in october a new programming schedule for tlc was announced replacing its lineup of business and career information selfhelp and hobby programs with  hours of educational and entertainment programming aimed at an upscale adult audience the following spring a sixhour block of childrens programming was added october  also saw the company renamed discovery communications inc dci the future of cable was expected to encompass as many as  channels and john hendricks began giving thought to ways to deal with so many options announced in late  your choice tv inc was a new subsidiary that offered a prototype cable remote control device that could organize the hundreds of choices into  thematic categories for ease of use over the next several years the your choice efforts also began to focus on creating a timeshifting service through which unused channels would broadcast paid repeats of selected programs for individual viewers experiments were carried out on eight cable systems with some success but the concept faced great logistical hurdles primarily the problem of reaching agreements with the numerous content providers in the fall of  dci released its first cdrom in the company of whales which was based on the hugely popular documentary of the same name shown on the discovery channel discovery now was producing more original programming than ever before though the company did not have its own production company but rather contracted with outside firms for all of its shows popular offerings around this time included specials marking the th anniversary of the normandy dday invasion and the th anniversary of the resignation of richard nixon the network was available in  million homes by  or  percent of us households with cable tv the learning channel also had doubled its own subscriber base to  million homes during  the federal communications commission relaxed its regulations for cable broadcasters allowing them to add more channels and charge more for their services dci responded by announcing that it would form four new channels in  including ones on nature science history and a home improvementcooking combination the barrier to new cable channels was high however and a successful launch could require an investment of  million or more in cable system fees to get enough subscribers to make the service pay off expansion into retail in the mids in  dci spent  million to buy the coincidentally named discovery store inc chain of  texas and southeastern us educational and learning product stores dci already had begun selling its own licensed items through such stores as petsmart and the nature company and the deal was seen as a good fit with its expansion into marketing plans soon were laid to add more locations to the chain dci also was increasing its advertising which featured the tag line explore your world by   million was being budgeted annually in some cases dci used highly targeted campaigns such as one for a special on submarines that was promoted through us military publications when the program aired it received the highest primetime ratings to date for the discovery channel the companys brandbuilding strategy was working well as was shown in a  study by total research corp which ranked discovery second only to the national geographic society in consumer perception of brand quality the company finished ahead of such major names as att ibm and the wall street journal in the process dci also launched a web site during  earmarking  million for the project the result was an awardwinning combination of original articles video and sound clips and more earlier dci had begun publishing a magazine that also complemented its programming during the mids dci began to focus increasingly on overseas expansion in  the company launched spinoff channels in asia latin america and the middle east followed in  by others in canada india and australianew zealand more were added later in italy africa brazil germany japan and turkey channels ultimately would be available in  countries dubbing the companys documentary and informational programs into foreign languages was typically much less expensive and less complicated than creating foreign versions of dramatic material and much of the subject matter was universal appealing equally well to viewers throughout the world during this period dci also announced a move into feature film production forming a new subsidiary for this purpose that was expected to issue one or two titles per year including some shot in the largeformat imax process in february  dci announced a joint venture with one of its investors telecommunications inc the new company etc wtci would offer seven hours of commercialfree cable programming directly to schools including some material taken from the discovery and learning channels former us congressman tony coelho was named chairman and ceo the new company which initially targeted some  large schools nationwide planned to charge  a year per student for the service the fee also would cover installation of the necessary hardware and software as well as training on its use a short time after this dci broadened its retail presence with the  million acquisition of the nature companys chain of  stores in  states over time the stores were to be rebranded as discovery channel stores the move was in line with what other large media companies such as disney and warner brothers were attempting—operating chains of stores that served to bolster brand identity while also trading on public familiarity with the name a new squarefoot flagship superstore was soon announced for the washington dc area near dcis bethesda maryland headquarters typical stores in the chain were smaller falling in the range of  to  square feet in october  two other major steps were taken by dci one was a new partnership with the british broadcasting corporation to produce a bbcbranded cable channel in the united states bbc america would feature the respected dramatic and performing arts programming for which the british company was known with dci handling the logistics and also contributing some of the content dci anticipated spending more than  million over a fiveyear period on the deal which would possibly include other cable channels and the programming necessary to flesh them out dci also was given first look options on new bbc programming putting the company ahead of such competitors as the arts  entertainment and public broadcasting networks creation of animal planet in the mids at the same time the company launched animal planet a new cable channel focusing on both domestic and wild animals which was  percent owned by the bbc after its launch the channels audience grew quickly its appeal cutting across age and ethnic lines part of the growth also was due to fees dci paid cable companies to add animal planet to their lineups dci simultaneously announced the creation of four digital broadcast channels which were available to only a limited number of viewers the channels discovery home  leisure discovery kids discovery science and discovery civilization were expected to become more widely seen when digital broadcasting took hold as a popular medium in the meantime the new channels produced with smaller budgets than the companys primary ones served as useful trial balloons to test the viability of new concepts in september  discovery announced that it would buy  percent of the travel channel from paxson communications for  million the travel channel had  million subscribers and presented a mix of travel tips and vacation site profiles discovery soon began providing programming and logistical support for the channel later in february  dci purchased the remaining  percent of the operation the companys flagship store opened in february  six months late and  million over budget the now squarefoot store featured a television studio an seat theater a trex skeleton and the nose of a world war ii era b bomber that customers could climb into products offered for sale ranged from dcis full line of videos to games telescopes fossils and even an iceage bear skeleton priced at  during early  dci also attempted to purchase the lowrated court tv cable channel from its owners a consortium led by time warner the  million deal was nixed by time warner shareholder and vicechairman ted turner however reportedly because he feared dci might convert court tv into a concept that would compete with one of his own channels in december dci completed another acquisition attempt and bought cbss struggling eye on people channel after initially planning to purchase only  percent of it eye on people later changed to discovery people had only  million subscribers and was losing money for its parent company dci planned to continue to air the channels mix of celebrity news and profiles which included some content provided by cbs during the year dci also added two channels to its digital broadcasting lineup discovery wings and the discovery health channel a spanishlanguage digital channel was being offered by this time as well entering the field of health in the late s at years end dci formed a new subsidiary discovery health media inc a multimedia venture that was intended to make the company a leader in the field of health and medical information more than  million was allocated for the startup which was to include a web site that offered health news and information the following summer digital channel discovery health was upgraded to regular cable status as part of the initiative the late s also saw dci lay plans to move its operations from bethesda to silver spring maryland by  the company would occupy three buildings two of which were to be newly constructed several other highprofile organizations soon followed suit and prepared to move to the once blighted silver spring one was the american film institute which would open a facility there and also coproduce a documentary film festival with dci in november  the company shut down its themed entertainment unit as a costcutting measure the closing would mean the end of discovery channel pictures which had made imax films including africas elephant kingdom as well as the eco challenge madefortv sports event at the same time dci invested in petstorecom an online pet supply and information site that was expected to be used to crosspromote animal planet dci subsequently reshuffled its online operations and placed its web companies in a new subsidiary discoverycom inc which was reportedly on the verge of being spun off to investors dci head john hendricks also announced that he was helping to launch a new womens soccer league which would field eight newly formed teams in  the summer of  saw discoverycoms ipo plans shelved with  million in new financing sought through private investors the move followed a downturn in investor confidence in the potential of the web as a profitmaking entity in november the company laid off  percent of discoverycoms staff as profitability for the venture appeared more and more elusive dcis web site was redesigned to focus on the core television properties with news stories and other original content reduced later in the year dci also scaled back its plans for the silver spring facilities canceling construction of one of the new buildings the company had by this time quietly abandoned its eye on people and your choice tv ventures as well in early  a potential challenge to dcis dominance of the cable documentary market was launched by the national geographic society with the backing of fox cable networks dcis hendricks dismissed the startup as too little too late noting that it would cost at least  million to get a comparable subscriber base to meet discovery on its own turf an equitrend consumer survey recently had ranked discovery as the number one most trusted brand name eclipsing national geographics hold on the top spot national geographic went on the air with ten million subscribers with plans over the next several years to reach  million—a figure still far below discovery channels  million the learning channels  million or animal planets  million meanwhile discovery specials raising the mammoth and walking with dinosaurs set backtoback records for cable documentaries with  million and  million viewers respectively nearing its th year in business discovery communications inc had assembled a formidable multimedia empire that was still growing firmly established on cable television the
