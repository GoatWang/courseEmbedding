receive the exclusive right to have its brand name displayed on helmets worn by players during nfl games while nfl players remained free to wear helmets made by other companies the agreement required that brand names other than riddells had to be covered during league play the court found that the appearance of a manufacturers trademark on helmets used during nfl games was not essential to schutts ability to compete effectively noting that other avenues of advertising were available to schutt the court found no violation of the antitrust laws jockey international inc v mallory  church corp opposition no  ttab  lead counsel for jockey international inc in a case in which jockey asserted its prior rights in the mark elance for underwear against applicants requested registration of the mark elaan stylized for neckties because jockeys registration covered elance in typed capital letters the ttab considered all reasonable manners in which the mark could be depicted including a script form similar to that used by applicant finding confusion between the marks to be likely the ttab sustained the opposition general mills inc v kellogg company no   f d   uspq d  th cir  represented general mills in an action in which kellogg company sought a preliminary injunction against general mills use of the mark oatmeal raisin crisp for a new breakfast cereal the us court of appeals for

raisin crisp also for breakfast cereal the court noted that the differences in overall packaging precluded any likelihood of confusion acknowledging that there are some similarities between the marks the district court nevertheless found after comparing the respective color schemes lettering styles and box designs that the two marks likely are different enough to avoid consumer confusion in properly focusing on the total effect conveyed by both marks the district court did not clearly err in finding no confusing similarity between them jockey international inc v donnie t butler opposition no  ttab  represented jockey international inc in an opposition against registration of a jockey on horseback design mark for clothing products the ttab ruled in jockeys favor based on the
