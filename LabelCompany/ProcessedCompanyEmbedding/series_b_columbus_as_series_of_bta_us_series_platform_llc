sponsored by being invited to lift in the animal cage is a big deal some of the strongest people in the world will be watching along with a rapt crowd heres how one powerlifter prepared for the event animal june   sponsored by the expo at the arnold sports festival in columbus ohio each year is in a single word madness its a seething mass of pushing bodies glaring posters and highvolume noise that can feel overwhelming even to people whove been to dozens of similar events but some parts are crazier than others while the majority of the booths are handing out samples pushing products and focusing on the dollars and cents animal envisioned a different approach when we first visited the arnold over a decade ago bring the barbells dumbbells squat racks a bench press and a deadlift platform to the expo floor throw up a foot chainlink cage around it and let the best powerlifters and bodybuilders in the world put on a show for fans while they stand just a few feet away over the years the cage has come to be known as the super bowl of powerlifting in many lifters eyes no its not an official competition and no what happens arent official recorded lifts but that doesnt mean they dont count being invited to lift for the crowd here is a major honor for any lifter just ask pete rubish this upandcoming powerlifter has already pulled  pounds at a bodyweight of just  and totaled  pounds in competition hes even pulled  pounds an astonishing  times in a single workout for an animal video earlier this year he knows the pressure of a big stage and a heavy weight but he also relishes grinding through highrep sets with weights that would buckle other strong lifters in short he was perfect for the cage heres how he prepared have a plan but dont be afraid to change it originally i planned on doing  for  reps rubish says but i wanted to increase the challenge because we decide what were doing in these things like  months out and then obviously as the cage gets closer plans change so i decided i wanted to do  for  on petes instagram leading up to the event you can see him pulling  pounds for  reps then  for —both beltless the latter he says was a massive pr but he knew it was only the appetizer for the main course in columbus a post shared by pete rubish peterubish on feb   at pm pst let the greats inspire you when pete arrived in ohio on friday an immense surprise was in store russian olympic weightlifting and powerlifting champion mikhail koklyaev one of the greats in the sport wanted to deadlift with pete while he was in town i just thought what better time to do it than on saturday when im lifting pete says this wasnt going to be a competition per se—koklyaev was coming off a triceps tear after all—but a chance to push one another to a great performance its not often you get to be around a legend like that and it made me step my game up pete said universal nutrition animal nitro promotes recovery increased energy and greater strength go now let your training guide you with the crowd screaming the mc booming and koklyaev having already pulled a single at  pounds the stage was set for petes battle against  at another time in his life he would have prepared by making himself see red but in this case the only red was his animal tshirt thats a lot different than in the past when i would try to get as angry as i could and get all amped up he recalls now its like i try to calm myself i try to focus deep breaths close my eyes and just get into a state where theres nothing around me i block it all out its just me and that bar in front of me i know what the goal is and i set up to do that and no matter what gets thrown at me im still in that same state in short he tried to mimic his training in his home gym earbuds went in the crowd went away and it was just man and iron leave no doubt if you could have done more for six reps the bar went up as smooth as silk number seven was a grind but pete can grind with the best of them and he locked it out—even though he was brought to his knees at the end of the rep but he kept his hands on the bar this was a crucial moment would he stop for the eighth rep i basically know that this is all ive got he recalls this is going to be it its going to be a matter of if i can get this up or not and im thinking about how tired i am and how heavy this feels but i know i have to try it i want to go to absolute failure i dont want to leave anything back no second guessing as far as if i could have done more reps he pulled the bar went up…then came down he was done but as koklyaev walked toward pete and raised his hands in the air it was clear that this man had left it all out there take your pr and come back another day the goal was  pounds for  reps the result was  pounds for  reps but a pr is a pr and pete wasnt going to dismiss it im not too upset but i would have liked to do better that was a pretty cool moment when mikhail lifted my arm up he recalls it was a really good day just not quite what i would have hoped i could hit its still the most ive ever done beltless thats the beauty and cruelty of the cage you get one opportunity to display what you can do and that moment defines you in the eyes of everyone present—maybe even some of your heroes would you play it safe or would you push it until you had absolutely nothing left in the tank for this powerful strength icon there was no doubt live in the moment enjoy it pete says try to take it all in and do the best you can when you have the opportunity because it might not always be there you may
