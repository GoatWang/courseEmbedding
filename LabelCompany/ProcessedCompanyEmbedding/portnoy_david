roth cover artist paul bacon country united states language english publisher random house publication date january   media type print hardcover pages  isbn  oclc  preceded by when she was good followed by our gang portnoys complaint is a  american novel that turned its author philip roth into a major celebrity sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver the novel tells the humorous monologue of a lustridden motheraddicted young jewish bachelor who confesses to his psychoanalyst in intimate shameful detail and coarse abusive language many of its characteristics comedic prose themes of sexual desire and sexual frustration a selfconscious literariness went on to become roth trademarkscitation needed in  the modern library ranked portnoys complaint nd on its list of the  best englishlanguage novels of the th century time included this novel in its time  best englishlanguage novels from  to  contents  structure and themes  writing  responses reviews and attacks  censorship  allusions to the title  adaptations  notes  references  further reading  external links structure and themesedit structurally portnoys complaint is a continuous monologue as narrated by its speaker alexander portnoy to his psychoanalyst dr spielvogel roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by the permissive conventions of the patientanalyst situation which would permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate shameful detail and coarse abusive language that  in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic exhibitionistic and nothing but obscene portnoy is a lustridden mother addicted young jewish bachelor and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative and in his mind degrading and shameful acts of eroticismcitation needed also much of his dilemma is that his sense of himself his past and his ridiculous destiny is so fixed roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book on the first page of the novel one finds this clinical definition of portnoys complaint as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction portnoys complaint a disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings often of a perverse nature the title also alludes to the common literary form of complaint such as the lovers complaint which typically presents the speakers comments on being a spurned lover other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of american jews their relationship to the jews of israel and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a jewish family portnoys complaint is also emblematic of the times during which it was published most obviously the books sexual frankness was both a product of and a reflection on the sexual revolution that was in full swing during the late s and the books narrative style a huge departure from the stately semijamesian prose of roths earlier novels has often been likened to the standup performances of s comedian lenny bruce the novel is notable for its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver which portnoys mother later serves for dinner writingedit roth had begun work on portnoys complaint in  before publication of his novel when she was good that year the piece had its genesis in a satirical monologue roth had written to accompany a slide show proposed for inclusion in the risqué revue oh calcutta that would focus on the sexual organs of the rich and famous while the slide show would never come to fruition roth found part of the accompanying monologue about masturbation salvageable roth refashioned the material for the novel and sold a chapter of the book entitled whacking off to partisan review progress on the novel was slow because roth was suffering from writers block relating to his exwife margaret martinson and the unpleasant notion that any royalties generated by the novel would have to be split equally with her in may  martinson was killed in a car crash in central park roths writers block lifted and following martinsons funeral he traveled to the yaddo literary retreat to complete the manuscript responses reviews and attacksedit the publication of the novel caused a major controversy in american public discourse the two aspects that evoked such outrage were its explicit and candid treatment about sexuality and obscenities including detailed depiction of masturbation which was revolutionary in the late s and the irreverent portrait of jewish identity it sparked an uproar in the jewish community even among new york intellectuals such as irving howe and diana trilling censorshipedit in  the book was declared a prohibited import in australia though the australian publisher penguin books resisted and had copies printed in secret and stored in fleets of moving trucks several attempts to prosecute penguin and any bookseller carrying the book failed many libraries in the united states banned the book because of its detailed discussion of masturbation and its explicit language allusions to the titleedit the popularity of the novel has caused the title to become a sort of shorthand for any form of sexual malaise or activity in his autobiography dick cavett wrote that on one occasion when a male guest was unable to appear on his talk show cavett jokingly told the studio audience the guest could not attend because he was suffering from portnoys complaint a comment which the network censors decided to cut from the broadcast tape gore vidal once quipped to claire bloom roths second wife you have already had portnoys complaint her previous husband do not involve yourself with portnoy on the september   episode of the daily show as part of an extended segment on the amount of violence in major religious texts jon stewart and john oliver

publication date january   media type print hardcover pages  isbn  oclc  preceded by when she was good followed by our gang portnoys complaint is a  american novel that turned its author philip roth into a major celebrity sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver the novel tells the humorous monologue of a lustridden motheraddicted young jewish bachelor who confesses to his psychoanalyst in intimate shameful detail and coarse abusive language many of its characteristics comedic prose themes of sexual desire and sexual frustration a selfconscious literariness went on to become roth trademarkscitation needed in  the modern library ranked portnoys complaint nd on its list of the  best englishlanguage novels of the th century time included this novel in its time  best englishlanguage novels from  to  contents  structure and themes  writing  responses reviews and attacks  censorship  allusions to the title  adaptations  notes  references  further reading  external links structure and themesedit structurally portnoys complaint is a continuous monologue as narrated by its speaker alexander portnoy to his psychoanalyst dr spielvogel roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by the permissive conventions of the patientanalyst situation which would permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate shameful detail and coarse abusive language that  in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic exhibitionistic and nothing but obscene portnoy is a lustridden mother addicted young jewish bachelor and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative and in his mind degrading and shameful acts of eroticismcitation needed also much of his dilemma is that his sense of himself his past and his ridiculous destiny is so fixed roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book on the first page of the novel one finds this clinical definition of portnoys complaint as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction portnoys complaint a disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings often of a perverse nature the title also alludes to the common literary form of complaint such as the lovers complaint which typically presents the speakers comments on being a spurned lover other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of american jews their relationship to the jews of israel and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a jewish family portnoys complaint is also emblematic of the times during which it was published most obviously the books sexual frankness was both a product of and a reflection on the sexual revolution that was in full swing during the late s and the books narrative style a huge departure from the stately semijamesian prose of roths earlier novels has often been likened to the standup performances of s comedian lenny bruce the novel is notable for its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver which portnoys mother later serves for dinner writingedit roth had begun work on portnoys complaint in  before publication of his novel when she was good that year the piece had its genesis in a satirical monologue roth had written to accompany a slide show proposed for inclusion in the risqué revue oh calcutta that would focus on the sexual organs of the rich and famous while the slide show would never come to fruition roth found part of the accompanying monologue about masturbation salvageable roth refashioned the material for the novel and sold a chapter of the book entitled whacking off to partisan review progress on the novel was slow because roth was suffering from writers block relating to his exwife margaret martinson and the unpleasant notion that any royalties generated by the novel would have to be split equally with her in may  martinson was killed in a car crash in central park roths writers block lifted and following martinsons funeral he traveled to the yaddo literary retreat to complete the manuscript responses reviews and attacksedit the publication of the novel caused a major controversy in american public discourse the two aspects that evoked such outrage were its explicit and candid treatment about sexuality and obscenities including detailed depiction of masturbation which was revolutionary in the late s and the irreverent portrait of jewish identity it sparked an uproar in the jewish community even among new york intellectuals such as irving howe and diana trilling censorshipedit in  the book was declared a prohibited import in australia though the australian publisher penguin books resisted and had copies printed in secret and stored in fleets of moving trucks several attempts to prosecute penguin and any bookseller carrying the book failed many libraries in the united states banned the book because of its detailed discussion of masturbation and its explicit language allusions to the titleedit the popularity of the novel has caused the title to become a sort of shorthand for any form of sexual malaise or activity in his autobiography dick cavett wrote that on one occasion when a male guest was unable to appear on his talk show cavett jokingly told the studio audience the guest could not attend because he was suffering from portnoys complaint a comment which the network censors decided to cut from the broadcast tape gore vidal once quipped to claire bloom roths second wife you have already had portnoys complaint her previous husband do not involve yourself with portnoy on the september   episode of the daily show as part of an extended

feelings too is among the if not the most tangibly realistic looks into the mind of a disaffected disillusioned shark suffering from depression and a touch of the bipolar the way the sharks mind works is incredibly true to form  the contradictions the hypocrisy the confusion the brief moments of sheer clarity followed by stretches of irrational thought he thinks hes better than the world and he thinks hes the lousiest shark in the world at the same time he wants everyone to go away and leave him alone and he cant bear anyone not even some schmuck he really dislikes with good reason to leave him hes nothing but hypocrisy and contradictions and confusion portnoy captures this in an amazing waypeople criticize the book because the shark is totally unlikable a guy who rails against phonies when he himself is something of a phony  but thats part of the point the shark throws off all the signals someone in his situation actually throws off in real life and just like real life theyre almost always ignored clearly this was a very very autobiographical work for portnoythere are several moments when the shark narrating in the first person mentions offhandedly that he began to cry he didnt know why he felt like dying and suddenly it went away and he felt invigorated with energy it rings remarkably true who wrote this stuff with such honesty in  who tackled these issues and in such a manner in the sthe reason this has impact though is not simply because of the subject matter not because of what the shark is going through and not because of the context of its time but because portnoy never plays it for melodrama he doesnt talk it up with purple prose or romanticize the sharks mentality or beat you over the head with hamhanded messages and platitudes he neither makes the sharks mentality seem cool nor does he preach against his attitude he just says this is what it is by presenting it in such a matteroffact manner all in the first person as if the narrator is simply telling you a story while having a few drinks the whole thing is rooted in a very tangible and therefore very disturbing realityyou and i know the shark weve known that guy and in sharks have feelings

some of the query and visualization features as well as uploading datasets  seems it has a lot of promise and i really hope it takes off  i think at the moment the biggest challenge for me is how to distinguish which datasets are trustworthy and clean  i also think they have an opportunity to greatly improve the search capability for datasets if they could provide advanced search directives such as explicitly specifying fields geographic locations time frames or semantic tags today i received an email from dataworld listing  favorite features of their users  they’re listed below and i’m sure exploring them could provide for countless hours of fun  add metadata with data dictionaries file tags and column descriptions  instantly query and join csv and json files using sql  join your local data with other datasets in dataworld  showcase your code data and documentation in python and r notebooks  see inside files before downloading  use integrations for r python or jdbc to pull data into your tools of choice  enrich your analyses with us census acs summary files  export datasets as tabular data packages a standard machinereadable format  pull data directly into tableau to create your visualizations  add and sync files from github google drive or s   open data panel at all things open conference leave a reply open data panel to be featured at all things open open data will be a

aws has introduced a python serverless microframework  it’s a beautiful concept making it super simple to create and deploy an apis with infinite scalability  it does so by leveraging the amazon api gateway and aws lambda without the learning curve  that said the ideal use case for the frameworke is for rapid prototyping or highly scalable deployment of a very simple rest api  it’s the right choice as long as the api you need is a good candidate for development using python with flasklike view decorators the framework is accessible via the chalice github repository providing a cli command line tool for creating deploying and managing your app  all  you need to deploy a new api is to put your app in a python file  how little effort is needed to get going  how about this… pip install chalice chalice newproject chalice deploy now you’re ready to hit the endpoint you configured note that as a tradeoff for simplicity not all api gateway and lambda services are exposed to chalice  there is a simple way to consume aws lambda’s builtin logging via amazon cloudwatch logs predictive analytics why iot is different leave a reply the challenge moving from batch retrospective to realtime predictive analytics first let’s get the lay of the land  batch processed analytics has a solid track record with welldefined use cases and best practices  and most analytics today are still limited to getting retrospective answers  many organizations are turning to the more forwardlooking predictive analytics to broaden the actions they could take beyond the confines of historical decisions and add ability to ask whatif questions the internet of things iot on the other hand is still quite new with methodologies for solving unique problems such as those around realtime processing and connectivity limitations still being hashed out  now add the desire to move from retrospective to predictive and you have a world of new challenges  in the past few years there have been great strides made in both technologies and methods in processing of data in realtime  but the move to predictive often takes an even bigger leap due to the challenge that to get more incremental insight requires an exponential increase in data ingestion and processing capacity  as a result predictive analytics still accounts for only a small fraction of a typical organization’s analytical capabilities   iot adds another twist network and processing bottlenecks what makes iot different when it comes to predictive analytics   in some applications the majority of collected data loses value within milliseconds  historically data collection has been the hard part of a predictive analytics system  however that’s shifting especially with advances in industrial iot technologies  iot brings capabilities to scale the volume of data collection while reducing latency  as a result now collection is becoming the easy part  the bottlenecks start at sanitization modeling and integration  this in turn makes the downstream components of analytics and taking action more challenging when looking at optimizing an iot implementation it’s important to balance the roles and capabilities of “edge” vs “cloud”  edge refers to specialized infrastructure that can improve performance through physical proximity  it enables analytics and knowledge generation to occur closer to the source of the data  edge gives you responsiveness but not scale  cloud on the other hand gives you scale but not responsiveness     making it work configuring the  components there are three core components in any iot implementation  first collection which includes sensing network storage and query capability  second learning to analyze the data and generate predictions  and third taking action typically using automated methods on the analytics from prior stages  in traditional cloudcentric iot architecture while the actual sensors are outside of the cloud the collect learn and act components of the system often run into responsiveness challenges  in situations where data collection volumes are particularly large the overhead of network communications has a significant impact on cost sometimes up to  of the entire system   moving any portion of these three components to the edge results in performance gains because less data needs to be moved between each  more buffering and storage can occur at the edge as the cost of memory and disk continues to drop  it should also be noted however that the storage and query functions of the system may become less prevalent as data is processed and acted on in realtime  then various aspects of data filtering computation and predictive analytics can be executed at the edge so that only data required for centralized processing needs to be moved  these gains need to be balanced against increasing system complexity resulting from the fact that edge resources may not be continuously connected to the network  so clearly there are many ways to implement and fine tune predictive analytics for iot  doing this will only get easier as the field matures for context…  the subject matter for this post came from a talk by venu vasudevan professor of electrical  computer engineering at rice university where we discussed what makes iot more challenging when it comes to specifically predictive analytics  this topic was presented at an iot meetup for the predix platform a cloudbased iot platformasaservice paas created by ge  it’s open source and built on couldfoundry’s stack  predix is available on aws and azure cloud services   leveraging healthcare data for consumer solutions leave a reply on april   over  developers from around the country descended on san francisco for the weekend to tackle some of the hardest challenges facing the nation  the event was called bayeshack sponsored by the nonprofit bayes impact  there were representatives from  cabinetlevel federal agencies present to set up the  “prompts” mentor the teams and judge the entries  the prompts for the us department of health and human services and the department of veterans affairs asked challenging questions on how to leverage existing datasets… how can data connect individuals with the health providers they need how can data get help to sufferers of opioid addiction how can data predict and prevent veteran suicide how can data tackle end stage renal disease esrd and chronic kidney disease ckd   as part of the judging process the teams had to pitch their solutions to both agencies and private sector judges such as partners at andreessen horowitz  all teams submitted their code to the event’s github account so that it could be used for judging as well as ensuring that it will be available in the public domain    for hackathons such as this one it’s important to recognize that even if there are already similar commercial products getting solutions into the public domain makes it possible for others build on later  incidentally this focus on actual working prototypes via github is surprisingly lacking from many hackathons  bayes did a great job focusing on potential implementation beyond just the weekend of particular focus was the “how can data connect individuals with the health providers they need” prompt since this data has only recently become available due to a regulatory requirement  this data consisted of commercial healthcare provider networks for plans on aca insurance marketplaces including plan coverage practice locations specialties copays and drug formularies  there were  team submissions most of which produced solutions focusing on usability for consumers and advanced analytics to policy makers  some teams expanded the scope to include not just insurance selection but access to care in general to summarize some of the novel ideas in the solutions… simplified mobilefirst user experience resembling turbotax for health selection visualizations and whatif analysis for policy makers voice recognition and nlp as in google freeform search instead of menus and buttons ranking algorithms and recommendation engines ingesting additional rd party information such as vitals yelp and part d claims for consumers who need additional information before they can make an informed choice providing an api for other apps to leverage enabling selfreporting of network accuracy like gasbuddy for health plan coverage here are some notable entries for this prompt the hhsmarketplace team created an app that leverages chart visualizations to let a consumer compare plan attributes against benchmarks such as state averages  the example below shows a user entering a zip code and the specialists they’re interested in seeing  the app finds the plans that meet those criteria displays cost comparisons for them and a graphical comparison of the options   the fhir salamander team created mobilefirst responsive web front end that takes the user through a series of simple menu choices to get them to recommended plans  along the way for convenience and efficiency it enables the user to click a button to place a telephone call to the plans to ensure that the doctor they want is taking new patients from that plan or to view the summary plan description files in working on the challenge the team transcribed the json provider network schema into a relational model  they reported identifying data quality issues and therefore needing to clean up the raw data in order to use it for analytics  they also generated statelevel statistics to assist in comparison  the app is written in javascript while the analytics are in python  they feel that the relational model code to load it and the code to clean up the data could be reused elsewhere  while the aws website httptinyccbayeshhsfsdemo is no longer live the deck is available httptinyccbayeshhsfs the hhs insights team produced an interactive provider density map  their approach was to target policy makers rather than consumers  for that purpose they built aggregate analytics and related visualizations  for example their code uses dol msa metro statistical area for geojson calculations and visualizations  in order to enable the needed analytics they had to take on the challenge of normalizing the json schema of provider networks into a tabular format as well as precalculating several aggregate metrics the hhs marketplace finder team created an app that displays the proscons of the top  plan option for the user along with visualizations for making quantitative comparisons easy to understand  bad choices are suppressed to avoid screen clutter  it starts with less than  simple questions  then adds a prediction of the user’s healthcare needs which was determined based on statistics by age gender preexisting conditions and location  finally it would eventually make it possible for a user to estimate their total cost based on different events such as hospitalization or illness a data science team from berkeley calling themselves semantic search submitted an extremely ambitious project  basically creation of a google pagerank for healthcare decisions  instead of the menus and buttons of a traditional app ui this solution used a freeform field for a user to indicate what they were looking for  the goal is to let a consumer who is not tech saavy explain their situation in a natural way without the interface and technology getting in the way  under the covers it uses natural language processing ranking algorithms and a recommendation engine  the user is ultimately presented with the top couple plans along with explanations of why they were recommended  to make the solution possible this app has to collect behavioral data logs use logistic regression to predict the probability that a certain plan would work and leverage the letor ranking mechanism to provide answers as an interesting side note a schemaorg standard for us health insurance networks has recently been adopted  eventually medical groups and insurance companies can publish semantically tagged information directly to the web bypassing the current single point of collection at cms  this would allow for a growth of relevant data that could be used by applications like this one     disclaimer the challenge prompt used for hhs does not constitute the department’s official stance or endorsement of this activity  it was used in an unofficial capacity only and intended to take advantage of data newly available from industry due to changes in regulations of the health insurance marketplace   schemaorg publishes health plan and provider network schemas leave a reply some good news on healthcare standards i have been working with the google semantic web group for many months to design several schemas that represent healthcare provider networks and health insurance plan coverage  the good news is that these schemas have been officially published for use with schemaorg  this is the first step towards a wider adoption for a more consistent designation for this type of information  the schemas are health insurance plan list of health plans and their corresponding network of providers and drug formularies httppendingwebschemasorghealthinsuranceplan health plan network defines a network of providers within an health plan httppendingwebschemasorghealthplannetwork health plan cost sharing specification list of costs to be paid by the covered beneficiary httppendingwebschemasorghealthplancostsharingspecification health plan formulary lists of drugs covered by health plan httppendingwebschemasorghealthplanformulary now for the background… in november  the us health agency centers for medicare  medicaid services cms enacted a new regulatory requirement for health insurers who list plans on insurance marketplaces they must now publish a machinereadable version of their provider network directory and health plan coverage publish it to a specified json standard and update it at least monthly many major health insurance companies across the us have already started to publish their health plan coverage provider directories and drug formularies to this standard the official schema is kept in a github repository httpsgithubcomcmsgovqhpproviderformularyapis  this format makes it possible to see how which changes were made and when  it also has an issues section to facilitate ongoing discussion about the optimal adoption of the standard  there’s a website that goes into a more detailed explanation on the background of this effort httpswwwcmsgovcciioresourcesdataresourcesmarketplacepufhtml this website also includes the “machinereadable url puf” seed file” to the actual data that have been published by insurance company  this file contains urls that can be crawled to aggregate the latest plan and provider data in terms of adoption us health plans that participate in insurance markeplaces have published   states  health plans  urls describing insurance coverage provider networks drug formularies  updated november  a group of companies representing the provider payer and consumer segments of healthcare convened to discuss the standard throughout   the considerations that went into formation of the standard can be found at httpddodhealthdatagovwikiinteroperabilityprovidernetworkdirectories open referral standard leave a reply the ddod program is currently assisting the proponents of a new open standard for publishing human services called open referral  in order for us to be able to justify the promotion of this standard and publication of data to it we’re first looking to develop clear and concise use cases the background open referral is a standard that originally came out of a code for america initiative a couple years ago with the goal of automating the updating of human services offered across many programs  doing so would not only make offered services more discoverable but also lower the cost of administration for the service providers and referring organizations the problem a landscape of siloed directories it’s hard to see the safety net which agencies provide what services to whom where and how can people access them these details are always in flux nonprofit and government agencies are often underresourced and overwhelmed and it may not be a priority for them to push information out to attract more customers so there are many ‘referral services’ — such as call centers resource directories and web applications — that collect directory information about health human and social services however these directories are all locked in fragmented and redundant silos as a result of this costly and ineffective status quo people in need have difficulty discovering and accessing services that can help them live better lives service providers struggle to connect clients with other services that can help meet complex needs decisionmakers are unable to gauge the effectiveness of programs at improving community health innovators are stymied by lack of access to data that could power valuable tools for any of the above   – source open referral project description for potential use cases there have been a small handful of government programs identified as potential pilots  these include acl eldercare services cms health facilities acf services va clinics sacramento california health data ambassadors program   the competition open referral is not without competing standards  in fact the airs taxonomy is already widely used among certified providers of information and referral services such as icarol  however airs has two drawbacks in comparison with open referral   first it’s not a free and open standard  while there are sample pdfs available for parts of the taxonomy a full spec requires a subscription “if you wish to evaluate the taxonomy prior to subscribing you can register for evaluation purposes and have access to the full taxonomy for a limited period of time through the search function ”  – source uairs download page and subscription page the taxonomy also requires an annual license fee which could be a challenge to continue funding in perpetuity for government and nonprofit organizations “organizations need a license to engage in any use of the taxonomy” — source airs subscription page second the airs taxonomy if highly structured and extensive  while that has advantages for consistency and interoperability it raises other challenges  it leads to a high learning curve and therefore sets potentials barriers for organizations without technical expertise  open referral states that it is a more lightweight option it should also be noted that there’s a civicservices schema defined for use with  schemaorg  its approach is to embed machinereadable “microdata” throughout humanreadable html web pages  schemaorg standards are intended to be interpreted by web engines like google bing and yahoo when indexing a website  that said the degree of adoption for civicservices in particular – from either search engines or information publishers – is unclear at this point   onward in concept the open referral standard would lower the cost and lag time for organizations to update relevant services for their constituents  the standard is being evangelized by greg bloom who has started with code for america and has been reaching out to organizations who would be consuming this data such as crisis text line purple binder and icarol for the purpose of defining a compelling use case there’s a ddod writeup on this topic at “interoperability directories of health human and social services” intended to facilitate creation of practical use cases     further reading… additional information on open referral can be found at open referral initiative’s  year in review executive brief of open referral initiative memo about federallyaggregated service directory data ddod iteroperability directories

discoverability leave a reply i’m adding a working document to cover the topic of open data discoverability and usability  it appears as though this is an area that is in desperate need for attention  i have come across it tangentially throughout much of my work  it deserves to be aggregated and curated  there are also some lingering opportunities to make practical use of semantic web concepts  there are vast repositories of data assets throughout government academia and industry that could be better leveraged  so lets make it happen   open data discoverability from david portnoy ddod featured on digital gov leave a reply the demanddriven open data ddod program has recently been featured on digitalgov  see digitalgov article it should be added that a major project in the works is the merging of ddod tools and methodologies into the larger healthdatagov program  the effort seeks to maximize the value of existing data assets from across hhs agencies cms fda cdc nih etc  already planned are new features to enhance data discoverability and usability we’re also looking into how to improve the growing knowledge base of ddod use cases by leveraging semantic web and linked open
