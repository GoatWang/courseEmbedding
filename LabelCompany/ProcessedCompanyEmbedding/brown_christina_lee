interest in the arts was more than financial a  courierjournal article said it wasnt uncommon for brown — as actors board president — to be seen cleaning windows or lugging props at the theater in his spare time he also helped lead efforts for actors to secure its current main street location jon jory who led the theater for  years and founded the humana festival of new american plays said owsley was not only a friend but a friend who amazed me  i have used him as my example of what one can be and do for years  in a  courierjournal article about browns retirement christina lee christy brown described her husband as a brilliant thinker with a passion for architecture and history contemplative and humble he wouldnt readily admit that he spoke or read french german and some italian and created oil paintings in his spare time she said at the speed art museum he was vice chairman of the board and headed a building committee overseeing a planned expansion christy and owsley were up in the galleries all the time speed director charles venable said in a phone interview brown would arrange his schedule so that meetings at the museum could be augmented by time seeing what was new in the galleries venable said browns death came five months after that of his mother sara shallenberger sally brown the family matriarch who was  and had spearheaded a restoration of the locust grove historic property after earning a masters in business administration from stanford owsley brown ii worked as an army intelligence officer at the pentagon most of his adult years were spent with the

while he broadened the companys spirits portfolio his favorite cocktail was traditional the companys founding brand old forester bourbon with ice and a little water in a tall glass earlier this year brown received the woodrow wilson award for corporate citizenship and along with his wife christy greater louisville incs gold cup award in honor of their civic and philanthropic leadership owsley instilled a culture of enduring growth for which the board and family are truly indebted geo garvin brown iv chairman of brownformans board of directors and browns cousin said in a statement the continued strength of the company and its role as a responsible global citizen are the greatest testaments to his lifes work brown is survived by his wife christy three children owsley iii victoire brooke barzun matthew and augusta holland gill and nine grandchildren a public visitation will be held thursday at the speed art museum from  pm the funeral will be  am friday at christ church cathedral on second street followed by a private burial at breeze hill farm the oldham county farm he owned with his wife the family requests that donations be directed to the metro united way or the fund for the arts the last thing he would want in the world is for people to say ‘well now that hes gone we cant accomplish what he was helping us to accomplish the speeds venable said he more than anybody knows that life can be fleeting and that louisville needs to raise the bar and really do great things going forward top editorial carrierjournalcom sep   the sadly premature death monday night of owsley brown ii at the age of  deprives louisville of one of its most generous and committed benefactors us rep john yarmuth was right when he noted nobody took the responsibilities of being a citizen more seriously than mr brown his generosity and leadership in the fine arts historic preservation and the quest for world peace set a gold standard for community leadership as chief executive of brownforman from  to  and chairman from  to  mr brown carried on a family legacy that dated back to the liquor companys founding in  while in charge of the company he led a vigorous effort to expand its international profile and to modernize the marketing of its brands with the result that labels such as jack daniels whiskey and finlandia vodka became readily recognized worldwide the companys financial returns were impressive however as the liquor market — like most other industries — went global brownforman remained a louisville company and a major corporate citizen it has almost  local employees still makes whiskey in jefferson county and has resisted the impulse to move its headquarters despite what it feels is a tax climate that singles out its industry unfairly mr browns own role in his hometown was prominent he served on numerous boards and led fundraising drives for the greater louisville fund for the arts and actors theatre of louisville he was lauded for his leadership in the rehabilitation of the actors theatre building the cathedral of the assumption and brownformans building in the  block of west main street after retirement mr brown and his wife christy expanded their already sizable philanthropic and community outreach donating hundreds of thousands of dollars from his familys charitable foundation to religious and community groups last years gifts included more than  to the center for interfaith relations in one of his final public pronouncements mr brown used the occasion of receipt of the woodrow wilson award for corporate citizenship in june to stress that in community life as in business better is preferable to bigger — and bigger is desirable only when it results from becoming better that serves as a fitting epitaph for mr brown — an emphasis on excellence and as happened so often he leaves his community yet another insight to ponder top remembrance christopher l kit kincade  sep   owsley was a tremendous force for good in the louisville community in addition to the many philanthropic efforts cited in his obituary owsley also supported a program called bulldogs in the bluegrass where we bring yale undergraduates to louisville in the summer for internships the genius and driver behind that movement rowan claypool  extols the work of owsley and his wife christy in helping to get it off the ground
