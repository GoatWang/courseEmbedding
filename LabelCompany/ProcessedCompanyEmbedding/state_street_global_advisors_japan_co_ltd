strategist selecting factors factors the essence of smart beta target single factors or multifactor combinations to meet your portfolio objectives the selection of a specific smart beta approach will depend on your unique investment objectives smart beta strategies harness the power of factors that active managers commonly seek exposure to while preserving the benefits of traditional passive approaches value value value stocks are those that trade at a lower price than their fundamentals earnings sales etc would imply over the long term low valuation stocks have outperformed  high valuation expensive names  size size smaller capitalization companies have tended to outperform larger capitalization companies over the long term volatility volatility creating a portfolio with lower volatility or tilting towards lower risk stocks can likely generate a higher riskadjusted return than traditional financial theory would suggest quality quality out of all the factors quality has perhaps the clearest economic intuition it makes sense that higher quality companies are rewarded with better returns over the longer term because they are better at deploying capital and generating wealth momentum momentum stocks that have done well recently tend to carry on doing well in the near term by gaining more exposure to stocks that have done well you can benefit from the momentum

improve the return potential of their traditional market cap equity portfolio the investor was cognizant of the current strategy’s limitations and its vulnerability to large exposures to highlyvalued sectors and stocks solution the client chose ssga’s multifactor smart beta strategy consisting of value quality and volatility factors to improve riskadjusted returns and diversification of its core passive allocation the client decided this was a more costeffective and transparent solution that required relatively low governance when compared to a traditional active portfolio read the full case study results costefficient diversification seek better outcomes for matched portfolios case study challenge a us defined benefit fund wanted to improve its fixed income performance relative to liabilities without jeopardizing funding status the client wanted to extract the quality premium from credit while maintaining duration yield rating and maturity of the liabilitydriven benchmark solution state street global advisors worked with the client to design a factorbased solution aligned with the investor’s goal of improving return potential while continuing to match assets and liabilities the approach tilted towards higher quality measured by default risk adjusted for value ultimately the qualitytilted solution delivered   bps of excess performance net of advisory fees read the full case study results funding preserved better returns avoid overdiversifying active exposure case study challenge a us nonprofit with assets invested by a number of active managers asked ssga to conduct a riskbased analysis of its public equity portfolio to understand the drivers of active return portfolios that use multiple active strategies may suffer from overdiversification with managers’ particular styles cancelling each other out our analysis showed the overall active risk of the aggregate portfolio was low high exposure to volatile equities and negative exposure to value meaning the portfolio favoured expensive stocks solution reallocate a portion of the active portfolio to smart beta strategies that provide certain desirable factor exposures that may not be reflected in the portfolio of active managers such as value and low volatility design allows for potentially higher active risk greater flexibility more control and simplicity read the full case study results focused exposures reduced fees longterm return targeting across market cycles case study challenge as part of a portfolio review a manager of dc plans sought options to help achieve specific factor exposure to improve returns over the long term solution recognizing that market timing is notoriously difficult we helped build a solution providing exposure to three underlying traditional factors instead of one our client appreciates that the multifactor strategy permits them to take simple factor exposures — the simplicity and transparency of ssga’s methodology in building the factor was a key attraction as an early adopter of the multifactor approach our client has since expressed interest in pursuing a similar strategy for its emerging market equity exposure in partnership with state
