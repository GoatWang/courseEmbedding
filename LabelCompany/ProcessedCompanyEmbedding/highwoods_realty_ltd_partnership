alan blackburn  sed   highwoods realty limited partnership v community loans of america inc no aa court of appeals of georgia november   timothy andrew baxter for appellant smith gambrell  russell stephen michael forte jason southerland bell colin rhys patrick delaney atlanta for appellee blackburn presiding judge in this action on a guaranty landlord highwoods realty limited partnership highwoods appeals the summary judgment granted to community loans of america inc cla arguing that the trial court erred in concluding that cla had not guaranteed the obligations of a new tenant who assumed the lease obligations of a prior tenant clas subsidiary and who later increased the term and rent obligations of the lease we hold that clas guaranty obligations pertained only to the obligations of its subsidiary the prior tenant which obligations were undisputedly fulfilled thus we affirm the trial courts judgment summary judgment is only proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law ocga § c a de novo standard of review applies to an appeal from a grant of summary judgment and we view the evidence and all reasonable conclusions and inferences drawn from it in the light  most favorable to the nonmovant matjoulis v integon gen ins corp so viewed the evidence shows that in april  highwoods and tellink llc a subsidiary of cla entered into an agreement for tellink to lease certain space in a highwoods commercial building cla executed a guaranty of those obligations which after defining landlord as highwoods and tenant as tellink provided that cla did thereby unconditionally guarantee to landlord and its    assigns the full and prompt payment and performance of any and all obligations of tenant to landlord when due    under the lease the guaranty covered all renewals amendments extensions consolidations and modifications of the lease in may  tellink and highwoods amended the lease to reduce the rental rate and to extend the term to june   in february  tellink sold its assets to now communications inc now with the consent of highwoods tellink assigned the lease to now with now assuming the obligations of tenant under the lease however tellink remained obligated as an unreleased assignor to ensure its agreedupon obligations under the lease were met through june   in a separate addendum to unconditional guaranty cla agreed that the assignment of the lease to now did not affect the validity of its guaranty indeed cla reaffirmed its continuing obligations under the guaranty in may  highwoods and now agreed to a new rental rate and extended the lease through june   in march  now filed for bankruptcy but nevertheless fulfilled all lease obligations through june   the date through which tellink was obligated as unreleased assignor highwoods demanded that cla pay for nows postjune   rent obligations but cla defended that it had only promised to guarantee the lease obligations of tellink not the lease obligations of now highwoods sued cla to collect on nows unpaid obligations under the lease both highwoods and cla moved for summary judgment claiming that the unambiguous agreements mandated judgment in their respective favors the trial court granted clas motion and denied highwoodss giving rise to this appeal construction of a written contract is a question of law for the trial court based on the intent of the parties as set forth in the contract which question we review de novo chowhan v miller we first decide whether the language is clear and unambiguous if it is we simply enforce the contract according to its clear terms looking to the contract alone for its meaning id here clas guaranty is unambiguous defining tenant as tellink and landlord as highwoods the guaranty provided that cla did thereby unconditionally guarantee to landlord and its    assigns the full and prompt payment and performance of any and all obligations of tenant to landlord when due    under the lease thus cla promised to make good on the lease obligations of tellink to highwoods it did not agree to make good on the lease obligations of any assigns of tellink indeed when the parties intended to include assigns in a specified obligation they did so the guaranty made specific reference to highwoods and its assigns as the beneficiaries of the guaranty with no reference to assigns of tellink as entities whose obligations cla was guaranteeing highwoods argues that by consenting to the assignment of the lease to now and by executing the addendum to unconditional guaranty cla agreed to also guarantee  the obligations of now under the lease highwoods reasons that otherwise there was no purpose to cla reaffirming its obligations under the guaranty as it was already obligated to fulfill those obligations without the reaffirmation these arguments fail nowhere in the addendum to unconditional guaranty is there any language purporting to amend the guaranty to add now as an additional party whose obligations cla was guaranteeing to the contrary in the operative language cla simply reaffirms its continuing obligations as provided in the guaranty and agrees that the execution of this addendum and the second amendment to lease agreement in which now also assumed the obligations of the lease shall not in any way affect the validity and enforceability of the guaranty or reduce impair or discharge the obligations of guarantor thereunder except as provided herein because tellink continued to be obligated as an unreleased assignor to fulfill its lease obligations through june   cla was simply reaffirming that it would continue to guarantee those obligations of tellink after the transfer of the lease to now when assets change hands and leases are assigned it is hardly surprising that a landlord would ask the guarantor of the original tenant to reassure the landlord that the guarantor was not going to raise the change of circumstances as a reason to back out of the guaranty obligations covering the original tenant indeed highwoodss own senior vicepresident used this rationale to explain why highwoods approached cla to reaffirm clas supposed guaranty of nows obligations when highwoods was seeking to extend the term of its lease with now highwoods maintains that because now became the tenant under the terms of the original lease now also became the tenant as such was defined in the guaranty such logic is faulty as each document separately defined this term for purposes of that particular agreement alone tenant under the original lease was defined to include tellinks permitted assigns tenant under the guaranty was defined to include only tellink the operative language of the guaranty in fact set forth that cla was guaranteeing for the benefit of the landlord and its assigns all lease obligations of the tenant with no reference to the tenants assigns highwoodss attempt to expand the term by substituting one agreements expansive definition of that term for the more restricted definition of that term in a separate agreement is without merit cf bufordclairmont co v radioshack corp court should give meaning to terms as defined in agreement see also howell millcollier assoc v gonzales lease amendment substituting new tenant did not necessarily obligate guarantor to guarantee obligations of new tenant this same concept prevents highwoods from using the definition of tenant in amendments to the lease to change the definition of tenant in the guaranty finally highwoods repeatedly points to the language of the guaranty that applied the guaranty to all renewals amendments extensions consolidations and modifications of the lease this is irrelevant now could modify the lease to extend for one hundred years at everincreasing rental rates however the extension or rent modification of the lease would not diminish the fact that cla only guaranteed the obligations of tellink under the lease not the obligations of subsequent assignees of tellink cla guaranteed a specific entitys performance it did not guarantee a documents performance where the language of the contract is plain unambiguous and capable of only one reasonable interpretation no other construction is permissible punctuation omitted barranco v welcome years inc here the guaranty and its addendum plainly bind cla only to guarantee the lease obligations  of tellink not the subsequent obligations of now accordingly we affirm the courts grant of summary judgment to cla and the courts denial of summary judgment to highwoods judgment affirmed ruffin and bernes jj concur notes  matjoulis v integon gen ins corp  ga app   sed    cla was formerly known as title loans of america inc in which name it executed most of the referenced documents  chowhan v miller  gaapp    sed    this makes perfect sense as it would be an unusual and risky business arrangement for a guarantor to guarantee the obligations of an unknown entity to whom the tenant might someday assign the lease whereas promising to guarantee the obligations of ones subsidiary to a landlord and the assigns of the landlord seems more logical and natural
