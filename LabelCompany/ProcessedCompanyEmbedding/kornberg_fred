million in revenues and operating profit of  million and an adjusted ebitda of  million i am very pleased with our third quarter performance on many fronts as we march towards a strong finish to what is turning out to be a very successful year our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter was  above our fiscal target of approximately  i believe this percentage will even be higher in the fourth quarter with room for more growth down the roadin this regard we have just started our fiscal  business planning process and im seeing positive signs across almost all aspects of our business we continue to be focused on increasing shareholder value being more competitive reducing costs and growing our revenues although theres still work to do i believe were on the right path and i remain very pleased at the progress that were making i will tell you why im so optimistic about our future in a bit but let me first turn it over to mike porcelain our cfo to discuss our financial results and update on legal matters and our fiscal  guidance in more detail then ill come back and lead it up to the questionsandanswers thank you mikemichael porcelainthanks fred and good morning everyone consolidated net sales for q were  million of which approximately  were generated from us government end customers  from international end customers and  from domestic commercial end customers consolidated backlog as of april   was  million and during q we achieved bookings of approximately  million a booktobill ratio of  which was led by strong bookings in our government solutions segment which achieved a booktobill ratio of  for the quarter and which is clearly a significant improvement from our last quarter and which bodes well for our futurelet me provide some color on q sales information by segment net sales in our commercial solutions segment were  million as compared to q of last year which were  million this represents an increase of approximately  sales on the commercial solutions segment approximated  of total net sales during q this segment benefited from an additional month of sales of our location and messaging based platforms and safety and security technology solutions such as wireless and next generation  platforms that we now offer as a result of the tcs acquisition in addition our commercial solutions segment benefited from increased sales of traveling wave tube amplifiers driven by strong demand from the inflight connectivity marketour booktobill ratio in this segment was  this ratio was lower than the amount we achieved in q primarily due to timing associated with several pending large multiyear contract awards that we are still expecting and continued softness of bookings in our satellite earth station product line although market conditions for our international satellite station customers are definitively improving and sales to those customers have actually increased overall sales for a satellite earth station products have been impacted by continued softness from us government customers which we attribute to ongoing political and budget uncertainty due to the presidential administration change that we mentioned in our last conference callalthough we are not expecting a significant increase in shortterm sales to the us government for our satellite earth station products we are expecting overall sales and a rebound in bookings of communication technology solutions to increase from current levels in fact we expect that the fourth quarter will be our peak quarter for satellite earth station bookings in aggregate in sales and end sales and we are expecting a large order for our traveling wave tube amplifier that are used in the inflight connectivity market in addition we are anticipating that our fourth quarter will also benefit from an increase in orders for our heights satellite earth station products now that it is availableour commercial solutions segment could really have a better fourth quarter of bookings we are in late stage contract negotiations for several large multiyear contracts for our safety and security and enterprise technology solutions and we are awaiting a decision by a domestic state to announce a large nine next generation  awardturning to our government solutions segment despite an additional month of tcs legacy government revenues from field support space components and cyber training solutions that we now offer as a result of the tcs acquisition net sales were  million as compared to q of last year which were  million this represents a decrease of approximately  sales in this segment represented approximately  of total net sales the period over  the period over period decrease primarily reflects the impact of the implementation of our tactical shift in strategy focusing on contracts that have more profitability sales of comtechs legacy products which include over the horizon microwave system products high powered broadband amplifiers and blue force tracking sustain and support services were higher than q of last year as a reminder this quarter includes only  million of bft intellectual property license fees and going forward we will not charge this fee to the us army going forwardour booktobill ratio during q in this segment as i mentioned was  and reflects the receipt of several important orders including a  million order from a japanese space agency initial funding of  million pursuant to a new  million five year contract to provide the us army with continued bft sustainment support and an initial order pursuant to a new  million firm fixed price idiq contract to provide bft aviation transceivers to the defense logistic agency these bft contracts were important strategic wins as fred will discuss we are starting to see the benefits of our tactical change in this segment and continued focus on the us army looking forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal  net sales in our government solutions segment are expected to be significantly higher than our most recent quarter now let me give you some color on our operating metrics our gross profit in q was  which is similar to the percentage we achieved in q of last year and higher than our q percentage looking to q we do expect our consolidated gross profit percentage to be slightly lower than the level we achieved in q most of which is driven by the absence of the intellectual property licensing fee as well as other product mix changeson the operating expense side sga expenses were  million in q of fiscal  or  of consolidated sales the  million reflects a significant reduction as compared to the  million we had in q during the quarter we benefited from a recovery of legal expenses and cost reduction actions previously initiated looking to q and given our expectations of sales growth we do expect that sga expenses in dollars as well as a percentage will increase in q from the level we just achievedresearch and development expenses were  million in q of  or  of consolidated net sales and was comprised of  million of spending in the commercial segment  million in the government segment with the rest constituting amortization of stock based compensation that is not allocated to our two operating segments total stock based compensation expense which is recorded and allocated as i mentioned was  million for the third quarter of fiscal  we expect amortization of stock based compensation for the year to range from  million to  million the final amount of stock based compensation will be dependent upon the final allocation of incentive compensation and our final stock price and our final fiscal  performance amortization of intangibles was  million in q of fiscal  on a gaap basis our consolidated operating income was  million in q of fiscal  our adjusted ebitda which excludes a  million favorable legal settlement that i will discuss in a bit was  million or  of consolidated net sales adjusted ebitda on our commercial solutions segment was  million or  of related set sales in the government solutions segment it was  million or  of related net sales given our overall sales and spending plans for the remainder of fiscal  we expect that consolidated adjusted ebitda both in dollars and a percentage of our consolidated net sales for q will be the highest of any quarter for the fiscal year let me now talk about taxes interest expense and our balance sheet the company currently expensed that its tax rate for the year excluding discrete items will approximate  interest expense was  million in the third quarter of fiscal  and primarily reflects interest on a secured credit facility our total interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs is expected to range from  to  for the year our actual cash borrowing rates which excludes the amortization of deferred financing fees currently approximates  adding it all up all in all it was a really terrific quarter on the bottom line we delivered gaap eps  per share in q and excluding a  million adjustment related to the litigation settlement our eps would have been at april   we had  million of cash and cash equivalents and yeartodate we have generated cash flows from operating activities of  million of which  million occurred in q clearly this was another spectacular quarter of cash flow generation and reflects an ongoing concentrated effort across our company to better manage working capital and reduce unnecessary spending given our yeartodate financial performance and our strong operating cash flows we have successfully reduced the level of our total indebtedness in fact for the nine months ended april   we have reduced total debt by  million of which  million occurred in q alone as of april   our total that excluding deferred financing costs was  million given our expectation that operating cash flows will continue to be strong i am pleased to say that we have entered into a first amendment of our secured credit facility that is expected to result in increased operating and acquisition flexibility while at the same time simplifying the calculations of our financial covenants as compared to the original terms in summary these changes provide us relief from the steep step downs required in the original net leverage ratio that more closely aligns the banks definition of consolidated ebitda with our own definition of adjusted ebitda it simplifies the financial covenant calculations and provides us increased operating and acquisition flexibility as i mentioned for those interested in the full details i refer you to our form k filed with the sec which contains the first amendment in full although it took some time to get this amendment finalized i am pleased with the outcome we were able to obtain this amendment from a position of strength as we were fully compliant with our covenants at the end of q and would have been in compliance as of q and likely  prior to this change given our current business projections and this amendment i am comfortable that we will be able to maintain compliance with our financial covenants for the foreseeable futurenow let me update you on the tcs litigation matters that we have been working our way through throughout the year as discussed on our last quarterly conference call we favorably resolved three different tcs legacy intellectual property matters in connection with one of these final settlements we recorded a favorable  million contribution net of estimated legal fees to operating income in the third quarter as of today we have made almost all cash payments required as part of these three settlements including making significant cash payments in q as such i want to point out that our strong q cash flow from operating activities reflects payments for these settlementswe still have one more case which we referred to as the vehicle ip matter and here too we have made some good progress and have good news vehicle ip was a tcs case that went back to  and just recently on may   the district court issued a supplemental claim construction order in our favor and the parties have agreed to enter into a stipulation that the defendants tcs and our customers products do not infringe the plaintiffs patent under the district courts current revised construction of the disputed patent claim term in very simple terms at the moment there is no infringement although we expect that the plaintiffs will appeal the matter if this decision is upheld we may not have to go to trial or pay any monetary damages at the moment the parties have agreed to postpone the july trial as such we are not expecting any significant legal costs for this matter or related cash payments in our q results given where we were at the beginning of the year with these four legal cases we are clearly pleased with the overall progress we have made finally before turning it back to fred i would like to provide some additional comments on our fiscal  guidance first we did update our revenue guidance to a new range of  million to  million this is a reduction of approximately  million from the midpoint of our guidance and largely reflects our latest assessment of the impact of our tactical shift in strategy in our government solutions segment as we deemphasize pursuing large commodity type service contracts that produce little or no ebitda margin our revenue guidance also reflects an updated assessment of the sales cycle related to our heights products as fred will discuss in a bit we are really excited about this product line going forward but the long sales cycle that we originally expected is taking a bit longer we also firmed up our adjusted ebitda guidance to a range of  million to  million we believe our  million goal is attainable but the ultimate amount will be partially dependent on our final product mix and the timing of a few items from our perspective no matter how you slice it we believe our q will be the strongest quarter of performance and will firm up  as a solid year as we exit the year we are pursuing a number of awards for large multimillion dollar and multiyear contracts and there is some uncertainty regarding contract awards and order timing as such it is difficult to predict our fourth quarter booktobill ratio if some of these orders are booked in the fourth quarter our fourth quarter bookings could be almost twice the level we achieved in q that said some or all of these orders may slip into fiscal  but either way these orders if booked are expected to benefit fiscal  financial results now let me turn it back to fred who will discuss our businesses in further detail fredfred kornbergthanks mike as i mentioned earlier im really excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead of us let me give you some color on what is happening in each of our segments first let me discuss our commercial solutions segment here we are a leading provider of satellite communications networks and products such as satellite modems up and down frequency converters and solid state and traveling wave tube power amplifiers were also a leading provider of public safety systems such as the next generation  networks and enterprise applications such as messaging and trusted location based technologies our commercial solutions segment is focused on several large growing markets our satellite base communication products participated in the satellite back haul and network services market in the satellite modem area we continued to be the undisputed leader in single channel per carrier scpc driven primarily by our proven ability to deliver the most bandwidth efficient modems our strategy in the past few years has been focused on developing and marketing our new what we call heights network solution for use with the new high throughput satellites last month we announced the general availability of our new heights dynamic network access or hdna technologies the height solution is intended not only to meet the demands of traditional fixed satellite but also provide distinct advantages for those system uses considering migrating to the high throughput satellite systems this is an entirely new market for us but one which is much larger than our traditional single channel per carrier market last month we also announced that three different customers have now installed and are now using heights to support their business needs to date customer reaction has been positive and we have a growing sales funnel of our heights opportunities we anticipate that we will benefit from an increase in orders for our heights satellite earth station products in the fourth quarter as i mentioned on our last conference call heights has a sales cycle that is longer than our traditional scpc products given the longer sales cycle as mike mentioned the complexity and sophistication of the heights system and our experience since our launch of heights were shifting some of our initial expected heights orders and sales to fiscal  as such we now anticipate that fiscal  will be the breakout year for orders and sales of heights another area we continue to be excited about is the ifec market or the inflight satellite based connectivity market our solid state power amplifiers help enable commercial airlines to provide inflight connectivity services to their passengers this is a new and growing market for us and we believe this area will be a significant revenue contributor for comtech in fiscal year  during the past quarter we saw a continued strength for our satellite communications twt or traveling wave tube amplifiers and received a  million contract from a us military integrator to provide high power sat com traveling wave tube amplifiers on the public safety side our solutions include  call routing for wireless  routing for voiceoverinternet networks and next generation  network solutions for state and local public safety operations we have built partnerships with key system integrators such as motorola and general dynamics and we are actively participating in multiple rf fees responseswe believe were seeing the benefit of our overall strategy as our pipeline is full and were in the final contract negotiations with several large multiyear contracts for our safety and security and enterprise technology solutions while we continue to bid on new opportunities we continued to roll out the multiyear next generation esi net deployment for the state of washington were also continuing to deploy next generation systems in california tennessee indiana and florida we believe that this market will continue to grow for many years ahead and that the current political environment will be helpful to facilitate such growthturning to our enterprise trusted location solution product line here our solutions include gps enabled software which we provide for verizon’s navigator services which makes it easier for users to find locate and get directions to various points of interest we also offer text messaging solutions and believe we are one of the leading providers of text messaging in north america we often carry a great platforms and high performance short messaging service or sms routing for cloud messaging centers wireless intelligent gateways and feature rich operated great messaging platformsduring the third quarter we received two key contracts for our enterprise technology products including a  million agreement for navigation and telematics services from a major mobile network operator in the republic of china who will use our location studio platform in their navigation and telematics applications and a twoyear renewal agreement worth  million with a tierone north american telecommunications company for the use of a customized location position gateway that manages all location requirements and access technologies including cdma gsm lte and wifi we expect this platform will be extended to include location of iot or of internet of things deviceswe’re also continuing to market products and solutions and are pleased with our customer feedback from our newly released location studio which was recognized by the cellular telecommunications industry association or ctia as the winner for the industrial iot product of the year looking forward we expect to provide location studio enabled applications in the connected car and mobile oem and data analytics domainsat this point let me switch to the governance markets in our government consumer solutions segment where we serve large government end users that require mission critical technologies systems our government solutions are primarily sold to us department of defense agencies and primarily consist of c isr or command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solutions our solutions include satellite line of sight and troposcatter event terminals management and sale of satellite bandwidth information technology outsource services and rfr and switching technologies as we announced back in march we continued to implement a tactical shift in this segment strategy to focus less on commodity service contracts with more emphasis on contracts for products with higher margins we believe that were starting to see some early benefits of this strategywe had a very busy third quarter in the government solutions segment we received several key contracts our fourth quarter and fiscal  will certainly benefit from the award of a  million contract to support the japanese space exploration agency or japsea for the design development and installation of multiple launch vehicle tracking stations in the south pacific these stations will provide mission supports for newly developed launch vehicle technologies we were also awarded a five year contract with a not to exceed value of  million to continue to provide the us army with bft sustainment support and received initial funding just recently of  millionwe were also awarded a separate indefinite delivery and an indefinite quantity or idiq contract to provide bft aviation transceivers to defense logistics agency with a five year ordering period through april  and a maximum value of  million we believe that us army has a requirement for a next generation system referred to commonly bft and based on our recent developments with the us army were becoming increasingly confident that we will be able to participate in future bft program awardssome of the large opportunities we see include a large multimillion dollar multiyear draft rfp which was issued in april by the dod for the supply of troposcatter communications equipment to replace hundreds of the an track  troposcatter terminals and as you know we have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time we have been a supplier of over the horizon troposcatter systems to the us government and commercial applications for many years we have a large worldwide installed base of over horizon microwave systems and our systems can transmit video and broadband data at throughputs of a  megbits per second i believe our field proven technologies are ideally suited to meet the government needs and we are actively pursuing this opportunity award is expected late calendar year  or early fiscal year  in addition to this large over the horizon microwave system of opportunity we are currently responding to a large multimillion dollar competitive solicitation from the us army to provide sustainment services to its antsc family of satellite communication systems we are the incumbent here and we believe our customer understands the value we bring to this very successful program award of this sustainment contract is expected to occur sometime in the early part of fiscal additionally on the cyber training front we continue to see interest from the dod and select national intelligence entities for our cyber training solutions unfortunately recent events have demonstrated that cyber threats continue to escalate to help the dod and other customers respond we provide a variety of cyber security training products and services this includes our performance scoring tool which enables real time performance based training we are also expanding this capability to interested commercial customers all in all we see very positive signs and broad opportunities for future growth across all of our business segmentsnow lets proceed to the
