allocation strategydominant benefit theory ongoing economic analysis beaumont financial partners — investment methodology investment methodologyinvestment committeeasset allocation strategydominant benefit theory ongoing economic analysis investment methodology we believe that a “top down” asset allocation driven investment approach with superior global macroeconomic insight leads to top tier riskadjusted investment results our competitive advantage lies in our ability to identify and select specific investments that will benefit from these value creating themes and construct customized portfolios to match client’s investment objectives our methodology starts with considering all asset classes from a global macroeconomic standpoint to determine themes that we think will offer the best prospects on a riskreward basis included in our screening are factors such as historical market data global demographic analysis balance of trade and national debt comparisons budgetdeficit calculations currency purchasing power parity analysis global interest rates and general supplydemand analytics across a wide spectrum of commodities and materials this work generates the themes sectors that we believe present the best investment opportunities for our clients and shape our rigorous asset allocation modeling once these themes and related sectors are identified we do more fundamental or “bottom up” research and analysis on the specific investments ie individual securities mutual funds etfs hedge funds etc for the core equity component of client portfolios we tend to focus on companies that have a history of generating significant free cash flow and sharing that cash flow with investors via their dividends we prefer companies that have a long history of increasing their dividend annually and have a modest dividend payout ratio in sectors that are more speculative our analysis might focus on the value of a company’s assets and the discount these assets are valued at relative to the company’s stock price other value catalysts we look for include management changes stock buyback plans sectors that are consolidating mispriced stocks due to market overreactions and improving business models portfolios are constructed by the relationship managers using investments identified by the investment committee each client portfolio is designed to fit within the risk tolerance time horizons and other client criteria so that the allocation of the portfolio brings comfort to each individual periodic client portfolio reviews monitor client allocations to ensure allocations are appropriate through this process we strive to deliver superior riskadjusted returns to each client      home  contact us   copyright  beaumont financial partners llc all
