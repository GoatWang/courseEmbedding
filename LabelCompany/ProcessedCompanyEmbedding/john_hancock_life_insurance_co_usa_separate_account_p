charge for each additional transfer in a contract year we do not currently assess a charge but reserve the right to the extent permitted by your contract to impose a charge of up to  for any transfer beyond the annual limit we have adopted policies and procedures to restrict frequent transfers of contract value among variable investment options variable investment options in variable annuity and variable life insurance products can be a prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options without immediate tax consequences as a result some investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of investment options in reaction to market news or to exploit some perceived pricing inefficiency whatever the reason longterm investors in a variable investment option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may expose a fund to increased portfolio transaction costs andor disruption to the fund managers ability to effectively manage a funds investment portfolio in accordance with the funds investment objective and policies both of which may result in dilution with respect to interests held for longterm investment to discourage disruptive frequent trading activity we have adopted a policy for the account to restrict transfers to two per calendar month per contract with certain exceptions and procedures to count the number of transfers made under a contract under the current procedures of the account we count all transfers made during the period from the opening of trading each day the net asset value of the shares of a fund are determined usually  am to the close of trading that day the close of daytime trading of the

transferred to that money market investment option if such a transfer to a money market investment option is made for a  calendar day period after such transfer no subsequent transfers from that money market investment option to another variable investment option may be made we apply the accounts policy and procedures uniformly to all contract owners we reserve the right to take other actions at any time to restrict trading including but not limited to  restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period  restricting the dollar amount of transfers  restricting the method used to submit transfers eg changing procedures to require that transfer requests be submitted in writing via us mail and  restricting transfers into and out of certain subaccounts in addition we reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of the funds we also reserve the right to modify or terminate the transfer privilege at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law and to prohibit a transfer less than  days prior to the contracts date of maturity while we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity it may not always be possible to do so therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing disruptive frequent trading activity and avoiding harm to longterm

each subsequent variable annuity payment under that variable investment option depends upon the investment performance of that variable investment option heres how it works  we calculate the actual net investment return of the variable investment option after deducting all charges during the period between the dates for determining the current and immediately previous monthly payments  if that actual net investment return exceeds the assumed investment rate explained below the current monthly payment will be larger than the previous one  if the actual net investment return is less than the assumed investment rate the current monthly payment will be smaller than the previous one assumed investment rate the assumed investment rate for any variable portion of your annuity payments will be

income taxes we are taxed as a life insurance company under the internal revenue code the code the account is taxed as part of our operations and is not taxed separately the contracts permit us to deduct a charge for any taxes we incur that are attributable to the operation or existence of the contracts or the account currently we do not anticipate making a charge of such taxes if the level of the current taxes increases however or is expected to increase in the future we reserve the right to make a charge in the future contracts not purchased to fund a tax qualified plan undistributed gains we believe the contracts will be considered annuity contracts under section  of the code this means that ordinarily you pay no federal income tax on any gains in your contract until we actually distribute assets to you however a contract owned other than by a natural person eg corporations partnerships limited liability companies and other such entities does not generally qualify as an annuity for tax purposes any increase in value therefore would constitute ordinary taxable income to such an owner in the year earned annuity payments when we make payments under a contract in the form of an annuity each payment will result in taxable ordinary income to you to the extent that each such payment exceeds an allocable portion of your investment in the contract as defined in the code in general your investment in the contract equals the aggregate amount of premium payments you have made over the life of the contract reduced by any amounts previously distributed from the contract that were not subject to tax the code prescribes the allocable portion of each such annuity payment to be excluded from income according to one formula if the payments are variable and a somewhat different formula if the payments are fixed in each case speaking generally the formula seeks to allocate an appropriate amount of the investment in the contract to each payment after the entire investment in the contract has been distributed any remaining payment is fully taxable surrenders withdrawals and death benefits when we make a single sum payment from a contract you have ordinary taxable income to the extent the payment exceeds your investment in the contract discussed above such a single sum payment can occur for example if you surrender your contract before the date of maturity or if no annuity payment option is selected for a death benefit payment when you take a partial withdrawal from a contract before the date of maturity including a payment under a systematic withdrawal plan all or part of the payment may constitute taxable ordinary income to you if on the date of withdrawal the total value of your contract exceeds the investment in the contract the excess will be considered gain and the withdrawal will be taxable as ordinary income up to the amount of such gain taxable withdrawals may also be subject to the special penalty tax for premature withdrawals as explained below when only the investment in the contract remains any subsequent withdrawal made before the date of maturity will be a taxfree return of investment if you assign or pledge any part of your contracts value the value so pledged or assigned is taxed the same way as if it were a partial withdrawal for purposes of determining the amount of taxable income resulting from a single sum payment or a partial withdrawal all annuity contracts issued by jhvlico or its affiliates to the owner within the same calendar year will be treated as if they were a single contract all or part of any death benefit proceeds may constitute a taxable payout of earnings a death benefit payment generally results in taxable ordinary income to the extent such payment exceeds your investment in the contract under the code an annuity must provide for certain required distributions for example if the owner dies on or after the maturity date and before the entire annuity value has been paid the remaining value must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of the owners death we discuss other distribution requirements in the preceding section entitled distribution requirements following death of owner penalty for premature withdrawals the taxable portion of any withdrawal single sum payment and certain death benefit payment may also trigger an additional  penalty tax the penalty tax does not apply to payments made to you after age  or on account of your death or disability nor will

internal revenue service may at some future time issue a ruling or regulation presenting situations in which it will deem contract owners to exercise investor control over the fund shares that are

choosing fixed or variable annuity payments for each variable investment option we then divide the resulting value minus any premium tax charge by  and multiply the result by the applicable annuity purchase rate set forth in the contract and reflecting  the age and possibly sex of the payee and  the assumed investment rate discussed below this computation determines the amount of initial monthly variable annuity payment to the annuitant from each variable investment option we then determine the number of annuity units to be credited to the contract from each of such variable investment

units varies from day to day depending on the investment performance of the variable investment option the deductions made against the variable investment option and the assumed investment rate used in computing annuity unit values thus the variable monthly annuity payments vary in amount from month to month we calculate annuity unit value separately for each variable investment option as of the close of each business day we calculate the value of one annuity unit by  multiplying the immediately preceding annuity unit value by the sum of one plus the applicable net investment rate for the period subsequent to such preceding value and then  multiplying this product by an adjustment factor to neutralize the assumed investment rate used in determining the amounts of annuity payable if your contract has an assumed investment rate of   per year the adjustment factor for a valuation period of one day would be  we neutralize the assumed investment rate by applying the adjustment factor so that the variable annuity payments will increase only if the actual net investment rate of the variable investment option exceeds   per year and will decrease only if is less than   per year the amount of the initial variable monthly payment is determined on the assumption that the actual net investment rate of each variable investment option used in calculating the net investment factor described below will be equal on an annual basis to the assumed investment rate described under the annuity period  variable monthly annuity payments in the prospectus if the actual net investment rate between the dates for determining two monthly annuity payments is greater than the assumed investment rate the latter monthly payment will be larger in amount than the former on the other hand if the actual net investment rate between the dates for determining two monthly annuity payments is less than the assumed investment rate the latter monthly payment will be smaller in amount than the

about determining unit values the general manner in which we compute annuity unit values is discussed above like annuity unit values we calculate accumulation unit values separately for each variable

return of your contract hypothetical example illustrating the calculation of accumulation unit values and annuity unit values assume at the beginning of the period being considered the value of a particular variable investment option was  investment income during the period totaled  while capital gains were  and capital losses were  assume also that we are not imposing any tax charge charges against the beginning value of the variable investment option amount to  assuming a one day period the  was computed by multiplying the beginning value of  by the factor  by substituting in the first formula above the net investment rate is equal to         divided by  or  assume further that each accumulation unit had a value of  on the previous business day and the value of an annuity unit on

annuity unit at the end of the period would be  x    x  or  the final figure  neutralizes the effect of a   assumed investment rate so that the annuity units change in value reflects only the actual
