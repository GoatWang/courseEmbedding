cognitive intelligence telefónica shows its transformative th platform project for the first time at the mwc   the application of cognitive capabilities to its platforms will allow telefónica’s customers to know manage and control their digital lives with the company and discover new customer propositions facebook microsoft and unicef participated in the presentation together with telefónica’s chairman and ceo josé maría álvarezpallete and chema alonso the company’s chief data officer who has shown also an example of implementation with profuturo mobile world congress mwc barcelona february   telefónica presented today its fourth platform that thanks to the application of cognitive capabilities will be the basis for a new relationship model with customers aura will enable users to manage their digital experiences with the company and control the data generated by using telefónica’s products and services in a transparent and secure manner telefónica becomes the first company in the industry to provide its customers the possibility of managing their relationship with the company based on cognitive intelligence the process of transformation began several years ago with the complex task of simplification and endtoend digitalization of the company in order to make the three platforms it already had intelligent  since  telefónica has invested approximately  billion euro in this process both in the deployment of networks and other state of the art infrastructure and in the integration of all its it systems or the development of new digital products and services these platforms are building blocks that enabled telefónica to develop a fourth cognitive platform  aura redefines the interaction between telefónica and its customers in a safe and simple environment with transparency and control over personal information aura will facilitate the discovery of new valueadded propositions based on the insights of their data and will be available through multiple channels and devices the fourth platform will make cognitive sense of this flow of data until now this data was generated in an uninterrupted although fragmented manner by the networks and other physical assets of the company st platform telefónica’s core asset its unified it systems nd platform as well as the products and services it offers to its users rd platform these smart platforms will imply a major qualitative leap in the customers’ experience with the company “cognitive intelligence will allow us to understand our customers better so they can then relate to us in a more natural and easy way and generate a new relationship of trust with them based on transparency and the control of their data” said telefónica chairman and ceo josé maría álvarezpallete during the presentation event “we are pioneers in this relationship model never before have the users of telecommunications services been able to talk with the networks in real time we’re expanding the relationship with our customers seeking to increase their satisfaction and opening new possibilities for them so that they can enrich their digital lives with us”   creating value through knowledge chema alonso chief data officer of telefónica resorted to the latest technologies for the presentation of aura using hololens microsoft’s augmented reality glasses he described the path that data follows through the first three platforms up to its transformation into something unique for each customer as proof that aura is not just a project but a nascent reality telefónica made several demonstrations through different channels such as a mobile app and the integration of aura with amazon echo for example customers will be able to ask questions about the products and services they use create and track a claim manage and unblock device access to the wifi router provided by telefónica get information about their favourite shows and program their recording or be alerted when their data consumption is greater than usual each user will have a “personal data space” the memory which will store the digital trace they leave when using telefónica products and services and which will allow the customers if they so desire to personalize their experience aura will also be able to make recommendations about offers of products and services that best adapt to the needs of the user the contents that adapt to their preferences the installation of security or the detection of fraudulent apps “with aura we want to transform data into knowledge and place it into our customers’ hands so that they are able to know decide and act and so that they can make the most of their relationship with telefónica” said chema alonso during the presentation   privacy and collaboration with different partners based on the principle of the customers’ privacy in their relationship with telefónica users will be provided with safety transparency and control over their data  aura will be easy to manage an example of this simplicity is the timeline feature which will enable users to chronologically see the data they generate as they use the company’s products and services in this space of trust and understanding with the customer aura will allow users to decide whether or not to share part of the insights generated from their data with third parties and so enrich their digital experiences integration with other technologies and digital services will make aura a powerful platform of innovation open to other partners and different technologies “artificial intelligence is poised to be the transformative technology of our time and at microsoft we aim to bring the benefits of ai to every person and organization on the planet” said peggy johnson executive vice president of business development at microsoft during the presentation telefónica is collaborating with microsoft in its fourth platform project “we have made deep investments in ai machine learning and an industryleading cloud infrastructure to set a new bar for intelligent services like speech and image recognition we’re thrilled to collaborate with telefónica to bring these next generation experiences to their customers” unicef also participated in the presentation with another example that demonstrates the great social potential contained in data users will have the possibility of altruistically sharing anonymized data regarding their mobility or use of mobile services in this way the united nations agency will be able to improve the quality of its predictive models improving its response to children in cases of natural disasters or health emergencies as unicef continues to innovate in an increasingly complex world we need to agree with new partners and use new technologies to solve the biggest challenges facing children  in crises like natural disasters diseases and the ongoing movement of millions of children because of war and violence unicef knows that partners and technologies are key to our ability to understand the world and act quickly  we are excited to work with telefonica and our other major technology partners to build solutions to the most pressing issues of our time” added christopher fabian cofounder of unicef innovation along the same line another use case is being developed in collaboration with profuturo the social and educational initiative promoted by fundación telefónica and fundación bancaria “la caixa” so that customers can anonymously and voluntarily give their data and profuturo can combine it with its own and obtain useful insights for the implementation of its social initiatives in this way customers of telefónica can help governments and humanitarian agencies to achieve the educational challenges identified by the united nations’ sustainable development goals fund  javier oliván vicepresident of growth at facebook presented an interesting example of the potential of new collaboration proposals this use case demonstrates an improvement of facebook’s safety check service for telefónica customers that have also registered with the service enhancing accuracy of notifications in case of an emergency when safety check is activated facebook will have the capability of notifying telefónica customers who are in the area prompting them with a notification so they can verify if they are alright in this collaboration the client’s personal information is not shared with facebook “we are excited to partner with telefónica to improve experiences like safety check so members of our community can let friends and family know theyre safe if they happen to be near a disaster area” said mark zuckerberg founder chairman and ceo from facebook’s headquarters in menlo park the use cases of aura shown during the presentation as well as the great possibilities opened up with this new model of relationship with its clients can be seen at the telefónica stand at the barcelona mwc hall   k  where the company proposes a unique

knowledge based environment skilled people and collaborationcomments telefónica is one of the world’s leading telecommunication service providers operating in  countries employing around  people and serving over  million customers around the globe in  the continuous and rapid changes in the telecommunications market led telefónica to reinvent itself and transform into a digital telecommunications company the combination of traditional telco assets combined with digital ones enable its customers to access and enjoy the latest technology to achieve this telefónica defined its path towards success by applying three values discover disrupt and deliver the lean analytics association laa team carried out a gemba walk at telefónica’s headquarters in madrid to document their lean product development journey and discover how lean thinking practices are impacting their innovation outcomes telefónica is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world in terms of market capitalization and number of customers it offers a range of services in fixed mobile and broadband networks as well as an innovative range of digital services telefónica stands behind three of the most loved customer brands the lean analytics association met telefónica’s research  development team responsible of coordinating the overall digital innovation strategy and the entire group’s rd to understand which practices enable their innovation process to be efficient in particular laa team was interested to learn how telefónica’s engineers and user experience designers develop many of the most strategic products telefónica offers to its global customers these practices were identified and structured according to the four building blocks of the lean innovation model below are just some of the best practices identified and described in the telefónica chapter of the lean product development best practices book  strategy and performance telefónica follows the lean startup approach in projects where the market is yet to be validated in other words when the innovation projects aim is to create products that offer new solutions to customers or to adapt new solutions for niches markets which are nonexistent up to now however in the cases where the market knowledge already exists and a validated business strategy is in place telefónica follows the product life cycle plc approach in these cases new products are developed within the plc framework  skilled people and collaboration lean startup is a relatively new approach which requires a new mindset and new way of working to support ease and speedup the cultural change process telefónica developed a specialized training this training focuses on upgrading the competencies of employees that have the predominantly technical background and enabling them to learn about and apply these new approaches and related methods to provide further support and continuous development to its employees telefónica strategically allocates each project to an experienced sponsor together with internal and external mentors and a project leader who provides coaching towards a different mindset moving from “achiever and performer” to “pioneer and explorer” ie interpreneurial  efficient product development process and knowledge based environment in  telefónica id introduced and transitioned to the use of the agile methodology for the development of their software programs however in  telefónica began to position itself as a digital telecommunications company and started to build digital products since then telefónica has followed the lean startup approach and has achieved significant improvements in areas like development time and quality while reducing cost and enhancing its learning culture all these changes have led to a significant cultural transformation within the company the lean startup approach helped telefónica to successfully launch several new innovation projects and set guidelines for emerging projects that are aligned with the company’s innovation strategy additionally telefónica actively involves its branding department and the sales force in the development and validation of projects’ core hypotheses  continuous improvement and change one of the best practices observed in telefónica is its approach to open innovation which involves working with others to blend internal and external knowledge and cocreate new solutions large organizations typically find the concept of open innovation very difficult to digest as their mindsets are pointed more towards ip and keeping the “knowhow” inhouse telefónica also regularly encourages and rewards its best and most successful projects teams and intrapreneurs additionally innovation teams also have the opportunity to share their progress and result with top management as well as with their peers and the best projects and teams are awarded by telefónica’s id ceo consolidated best practices as identified in telefónica structured around laa’s lean innovation model applying lean approaches in particular lean startup in a large corporation is complex and requires alignment to a new vision and mindset but the benefits are worth the efforts telefónica has accelerated its innovation cycle by  times thus reducing the time spent on each project and therefore decreasing the budget invested in each project by  on average at the same time and even with a lower overall budget the company launched within the same time frame more projects than before increasing the number of innovation projects by  while shifting the project focus to the customer this offers more opportunities to test a higher number of ideas with customers early in the project and consequently increase the possibilities of having a greater impact on its business
