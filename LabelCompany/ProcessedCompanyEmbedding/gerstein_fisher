tweet rss on september  real estate will become a distinct sector in the global industry classification standard gics elevating it from its former position as part of the financials sector real estate investment trusts reits offer a diversified costeffective transparent way for investors to access commercial real estate and are available today in nearly  countries around the world reits can act as a portfolio diversifier and an inflation hedge research supports the fact that they also hold up well in periods of rising interest rates we believe that holding global vs usonly reits can further enhance portfolio riskadjusted returns and offers exposure to a diversified set of geographic and economic environments september st will mark an important milestone for the real estate investment trust aka reit industry effective that date real estate will become the th sector in the global industry classification standard—the first new sector since standard  poor’s and msci formulated gics in  here’s how msci explains the gics addition “with the creation of the new real estate sector we acknowledge its growing importance in today’s global economy this change will elevate its position from under the financial sector recognizing real estate as a distinct asset class and a foundational building block of a modern portfolio” i’m aware of some industry projections that a tsunami of tens of billions of dollars of new capital will pour into real estate once it’s a separate and distinct sector indeed the looming change may already have stimulated inflows into reits this year i have no idea if those forecasts will be realized but it is easy to imagine that reits will attract more money from diversified mutual funds institutional and other investors simply from its higher profile after it is split off from financials additionally being categorized and traded more distinctly from banks insurance companies and other financial companies could also reduce correlations with the broader equity market which would enhance reits’ portfolio diversification benefit a theme i will return to below improve reit securities’ liquidity and lower the sector’s cost of capital this stock market development represents an opportunity for investors to review their exposure to diversified real estate and reits and i have long believed that many investors are particularly underallocated to reits outside the us nearly  countries now have reit legislation in place in the balance of this entry i’ll briefly summarize what i think makes global reits an attractive asset class for most investment portfolios making commercial real estate more accessible the creation of reits—publicly traded securities that own and operate properties such as office and apartment buildings shopping centers hotels and selfstorage facilities—effectively democratized commercial real estate investing these securities provide investors lacking large pools of capital with exposure and with excellent liquidity to commercial projects and professional real estate management we view reits as an attractive longterm strategic portfolio holding that generates returns that are highly correlated over market cycles with those of private real estate markets as measured for instance by the national council of real estate fiduciaries ncreif over most extended time periods say  years or longer reit returns have been equal to or better than those of equities for instance during the  years to june   the sp global reit index returned  annualized compared to just  for the msci eafe index of developedcountry equities and  for the sp  index but the way reits and equities generate those returns is quite different with the lion’s share of equity returns coming from capital appreciation and the bulk of reit returns stemming from dividends reits are required to distribute at least  of taxable income—the source of those dividends–to shareholders each year as an asset manager i frequently recommend that many investors have distinct and targeted real estate exposure so that they may own their reits more heavily within retirement or other taxadvantaged accounts indeed this hybrid asset class—with bondlike yields and stocklike appreciation potential—offers nice portfolio diversification due to relatively low correlations with other major asset classes from january   to june   global real estate’s correlation with us and international equities was about  with us and international bonds as measured by the us aggregate bond index and citigroup wgbi  year ex us the correlations were only  and  respectively i earlier indicated my preference for global—as opposed to usonly—reits since international reits provide exposure to geographic and economic environments ranging from london to singapore to sydney we have conducted a considerable amount of research on how adding  to  reit allocations to various equity and equityfixed income portfolios impacts portfolio returns and volatility we found that for instance adding a helping of reits perhaps  to  of the total portfolio to allequity or  equity fixed income portfolios produced better riskadjusted returns i invite you to read our research paper on this topic “investment insights taking a global approach to investing in public real estate” reits and rates finally i would like to address the link between reits inflation and interest rates one benefit of reits is that they can act as a strong hedge against inflation historically reit yields have been higher than the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index cpi and over most extended periods—in stark contrast with fixedincome securities—the income stream from reits has increased at a higher rate than cpi keep in mind that lease agreements for commercial property typically have clauses that build in inflation adjustments for rental payments based on the cpi or some other inflation index during the lease period i am often asked whether rising interest rate cycles which is bound to occur one of these days negatively impact reit prices though each scenario is somewhat different our research shows that reits have in fact historically performed relatively well in environments of steadily rising rates—outperforming equities and fixed income remember that rising rates usually coincide with periods of a strengthening economy and rising inflation which are generally positive factors for reits exhibit  reports the returns of the three asset classes in periods of both rising and falling interest rates from january   to june   exhibit  details how us reits performed during  specific cycles of rising and falling rates during the same  ½year time frame while real estate becoming a sector unto its own may generate increased investor interest at gerstein fisher we’ve always felt it has a place in most diversified portfolios for the reasons outlined above real estate securities such as reits are an effective and diversified way to access global real estate allowing individual investors to participate in a growing and important segment of the global economy schedule your complimentary portfolio review approximately how muchdo you have to invest
