home   s redwood rd   taylorsville ut    homeaboutcontacttestimonials cavalier investments llc we specialize in reuniting people with long lost money that they didnt know they had we do all the work  you just wait for your check​ how it works​​cavalier investments audits many different agencies across the country to locate sums of money owed to private individuals and companies if these funds go unclaimed for too long they are usually lost to the agency holding them we would like to connect you with your long lost property and keep it out of the agencies hands we do the research and collect all of the necessary documents that are needed for you to collect your property all you do is sit back relax and wait for your check​ ​contact us​if you have received a message from us concerning some property that we have located for you please call us at  and press option if you need more information please press option  we are happy to review the process and answer all of your questions ​we value our privacy and dont like getting hassled by solicitor phone calls or junk mail so we wont send you unwanted updates unless you ask us we dont give out our client information to anyone eitherwe look forward to hearing from you ​check out what some people have said “hey thanks for getting us the money  we didn’t even know we had we were skeptical at first but cavalierinvestmentsorg came through and the money helped us during the slow winter months terry dipoma  hvac  heating  air “you helped us get money fast we thought it would take months and you had us a check in a week  thanks  farrell newland of newland construction  contractor testimonials ​weve all heard that if it sounds too good to be true    it probably is  well rest assured we are not one of those things and if you give us the opportunity well prove it to you give us a call and let us show you what our research has uncovered you wont believe it until you see it cavalier investments audits government agencies throughout the country digging through their public records in search of lost missing and unclaimed funds belonging to private citizens now be careful because these funds are held for only a brief period of time after which the agency responsible for them may be permitted to seize them through a process called escheatment we think private citizens losing their funds to faceless government agencies a system rooted in feudal th century england is completely unfair and we are determined to prevent this from happening to anyone especially you copyright  cavalier investments llc all rights
