healy said the firms success bucks a negative trend in venture capital fundraising in a sign that the industry is going through a shakeout ventureinvestment totals have outpaced fundraising tallies since  according to venturesource which is owned by dow jones  co publisher of venturewire with the venture industry failing to deliver good returns in recent years many institutional investors are losing interest in the asset class as a result a number of venture investors have struggled to raise new funds including some wellestablished firms recently healthcare investor prospect venture

from the new fund is in sarcode bioscience inc which will use a  million round that sofinnova led in july to run phase iii trials of a dryeye disease drug for example the firm which plans to sink  to  of the fund into mid to latestage healthcare products sees strong opportunity to spin companies with these types of products out of larger players healy said as drug manufacturers reassess their priorities theyre increasingly willing to part with noncore products a trend that enables venture firms to build on the investment thats already gone into these programs weve seen an increase in the number of spinout opportunities healy said were seeing better dealflow higherquality opportunities that have much more clinical data one of sofinnovas recent exits came from shire plcs  purchase of
