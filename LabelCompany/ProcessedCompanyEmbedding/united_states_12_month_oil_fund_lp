and usof cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forwardlooking statements will come to pass usofs actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the

quarterly report on form q and usof assumes no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements although usof undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that usof may make directly to them or through reports that usof in the future files with the us securities and exchange commission the sec including annual reports on form k quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k introduction usof a delaware limited partnership is a commodity pool that issues units that may be purchased and sold on the nyse arca inc the nyse arca the investment objective of usof is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit net asset value nav to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light sweet crude oil delivered to cushing oklahoma as measured by the daily changes in the average of the prices of  futures contracts for light sweet crude oil traded on the new york mercantile exchange the nymex that is the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the following  months for a total of  consecutive months contracts except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the following  consecutive months the benchmark futures contracts less usofs expenses near month contract means the next contract traded on the nymex due to expire next month contract means the first contract traded on the nymex due to expire after the near month contract when calculating the daily movement of the average price of the  contracts each contract month will be equally weighted it is not the intent of usof to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit nav will equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light sweet crude oil it is not the intent of usof to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit nav will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day the general partner of usof united states commodity funds llc uscf believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in oil futures contracts as defined below and other oilrelated investments as defined below usof invests in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil other types of crude oil heating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels that are traded on the nymex ice futures or other us and foreign exchanges collectively oil futures contracts and other oil interests such as cashsettled options on oil futures contracts forward contracts for oil cleared swap contracts and overthecounter transactions that are based on the price of crude oil other petroleumbased fuels oil futures contracts and indices based on the foregoing collectively other oilrelated investments for convenience and unless otherwise specified oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments collectively are referred to as oil interests in this quarterly report on form q usof seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments such that daily changes in its per unit nav measured in percentage terms will closely track the daily changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts also measured in percentage terms uscf believes the daily changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil it is not the intent of usof to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit nav will equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light sweet crude oil it is not the intent of usof to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit nav will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day uscf believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments regulatory disclosure impact of accountability levels position limits and price fluctuation limits futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics most significantly the commodity futures trading commission the cftc and the futures exchanges have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge which an investment by usof is not may hold own or control the net position is the difference between an individuals or firms open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity in addition most usbased futures exchanges such as the nymex limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts currently the ice futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by usbased futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation while some other nonus futures exchanges have not adopted such limits the accountability levels for the benchmark futures contracts and other oil futures contracts traded on usbased futures exchanges such as the nymex are not a fixed ceiling but rather a threshold above which the nymex may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investors positions the current accountability level for investments for any one month in the benchmark futures contracts is  contracts in addition the nymex imposes an accountability level for all months of  net futures contracts for light sweet crude oil in addition ice futures maintains accountability levels position limits and monitoring authority for its futures contracts for light sweet crude oil if usof and the related public funds as defined below exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for light sweet crude oil the nymex and ice futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities including the total size of all positions investment and trading strategy and the extent of liquidity resources of usof and the related public funds if deemed necessary by the nymex andor ice futures usof could be ordered to reduce its position back to the accountability level as of september   usof held  futures contracts for light sweet crude oil traded on the nymex and did not hold any oil futures contracts traded on the ice futures for the nine months ended september   usof did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the nymex or ice futures position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express cftc authority to do so in addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time the nymex and the ice futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire it is unlikely that usof will run up against such position limits because usofs investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire and the eleven following months to the next month contract to expire and the eleven following months during one day each month for the nine months ended september   usof did not exceed any position limits imposed by the nymex and ice futures the regulation of commodity interest trading in the united states and other countries is an evolving area of the law as exemplified by the various discussions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the cftc the national futures association the nfa the futures exchanges clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements some specific examples of how the new doddfrank act provisions and rules adopted thereunder could impact usof are discussed below futures contracts and position limits the cftc is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on nonus futures exchanges and markets the cftc however has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of nonus futures contracts in the united states these regulations permit certain contracts on nonus exchanges to be offered and sold in the united states in october  the cftc adopted rules that impose new position limits on referenced contracts as defined below involving  energy metals and agricultural commodities the position limit rules the position limit rules were scheduled to become effective on october   however on september   the united states district court for the district of columbia vacated these regulations on the basis of ambiguities in the provisions of the commodity exchange act cea as modified by the doddfrank act upon which the regulations were based in its september   decision the court remanded the position limit rules to the cftc with instructions to use its expertise and experience to resolve the ambiguities in the statute on november   the cftc indicated that it will move forward with an appeal of the district courts decision to vacate the position limit rules at this time it is not possible to predict how the cftcs appeal could affect usof but it may be substantial and adverse furthermore until such time as the appeal is resolved or if applicable revisions to the position limit rules are proposed and adopted the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the enactment of the position limit rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives collectively referenced contracts under that system the cftc enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products eg corn wheat and soy while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products eg oil and natural gas as a result usof may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits finally subject to certain narrow exceptions the vacated position limit rules would have required the aggregation for purposes of the position limits of all positions in the  referenced contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates regardless of whether such position existed on us futures exchanges nonus futures exchanges in cleared swaps or in overthecounter swaps the cftc is presently considering new aggregation rules under a rulemaking proposal that is distinct from the position limit rules at this time it is unclear how any modified aggregation rules may affect usof but it may be substantial and adverse by way of example the aggregation rules in combination with any potential revised position limit rules may negatively impact the ability of usof to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit uscfs ability to sell additional creation baskets of usof based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations uscf does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of usof to achieve its investment objective swap transactions the doddfrank act imposes new regulatory requirements on certain swap transactions that usof is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of usof to meet its investment objective on august   the cftc and the sec published joint final rules defining the terms swap and securitybased swap the term swap is broadly defined to include various types of overthecounter derivatives including swaps and options the effective date of these final rules was october   the doddfrank act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations which are referred to in the doddfrank act as derivative clearing organizations dcos if the cftc mandates the central clearing of a particular contract on november   the cftc issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered dcos this is the cftcs first clearing determination under the doddfrank act and became effective on february   beginning on march   swap dealers major swap participants and certain active funds were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps and beginning on june   commodity pools certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear the same types of swaps as a result if usof enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps on or after june   such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future and when finalized could require usof to centrally clear certain overthecounter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bilateral basis if a swap is required to be cleared the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the cftc the sec or the applicable prudential regulator the doddfrank act also requires that certain swaps determined to be available to trade on a swap execution facility sef must be executed over such a facility on june   the cftc published a final rule regarding the obligations of sefs including the obligation for facilities offering multiple person execution services to register as a sef by october   on september  and   the cftcs division of market oversight granted noaction relief to sefs from compliance with certain regulatory and reporting requirements the noaction relief granted on september   included relief in effect until november   from a requirement that a sef enforce its own rulebooks and compel its participants to consent to the jurisdiction of the sef based upon applications filed by several sefs with the cftc in the second half of october  it is expected that the cftc will determine that certain interest rate swaps will be determined to be available to trade on those sefs in the first quarter of  on april   the cftc published a final rule to exempt swaps between certain affiliated entities within a corporate group from the clearing requirement the rule permits affiliated counterparties to elect not to clear a swap subject to the clearing requirement if among other things the counterparties are majorityowned affiliates whose financial statements are included in the same consolidated financial statements and whose swaps are documented and subject to a centralized risk management program however the exemption does not apply to swaps entered into by affiliated counterparties with unaffiliated counterparties on november   the cftc proposed new regulations that would require enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for futures commission merchants fcms the proposed rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the fcms with which they may choose to do business fcms are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner the capital and liquidity of fcms are strengthened to safeguard their continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the cftc and the selfregulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of fcms in a thorough manner the final regulations have not yet been adopted additionally the cftc published rules on february   and april   that require swap dealers and major swap participants to  adhere to business conduct standards  implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the cea and  maintain records of such compliance these new requirements may impact the documentation requirements for both cleared and noncleared swaps and cause swap dealers and major swap participants to face increased compliance costs that in turn may be passed along to counterparties such as usof in the form of higher fees and expenses that related to trading swaps on april   the cftcs division of clearing and risk issued a letter granting noaction relief from certain swap data reporting requirements for swaps entered into between affiliated counterparties in general the letter grants relief from among others realtime historical and regular swap reporting under part  part  and part  of the cftcs regulations respectively on april   the cftcs division of market oversight issued a letter granting timelimited noaction relief to nonswap dealer nonmajor swap participant counterparties from the realtime regular and historical swap reporting requirements under part  part  and part  of the cftcs regulations respectively the regular reporting requirements part  of the cftc regulations for interest rate and credit swaps of a financial entity including a commodity pool such as usof began on april   the letter delays implementation of the reporting requirements based upon the asset class underlying the swap and the classification of the reporting counterparty for a financial entity including a commodity pool such as usof regular reporting requirements for equity foreign exchange and other commodity swaps including swaps on oil began on may   and reporting of all historical swaps for all asset classes begins on september   in addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the doddfrank act swap dealers that are european banks may also be subject to european market infrastructure regulation emir these regulations have not yet been fully implemented general regulation applicable to usof on august   the cftc issued final rules establishing compliance obligations for commodity pool operators cpos of investment companies registered under the investment company act of  the investment company act that are required to register due to recent changes to cftc regulation with regard to any other rules that the cftc may adopt in the future the effect of any such regulatory changes on usof is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse uscf which is registered as a cpo and as a swaps firm with the cftc is authorized by the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of usof the lp agreement to manage usof uscf is authorized by usof in its sole judgment to employ and establish the terms of employment for and termination of commodity trading advisors or fcms price movements crude oil futures prices were volatile during the nine months ended september   and exhibited moderate daily swings along with a slight upward trend during the period the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts started the period at  per barrel average prices hit a peak on august   at  per barrel the low of the period was on april   when prices reached  per barrel the period ended with the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts at  per barrel up approximately  over the period usofs per unit nav started the period at  and ended the period at  on september   an increase of approximately  over the period usofs per unit nav reached its high for the period on august   at  and reached its low for the period on april   at  the average benchmark oil futures contract prices listed above began with the february  to january  contracts and ended with the november  to october  contracts the increase of approximately  on the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding oil futures contracts an investment in oil futures contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result furthermore the change in the nominal price of these differing crude oil futures contracts measured from the start of the period to the end of the period does not represent the actual benchmark results that usof seeks to track which are more fully described below in the section titled tracking usofs benchmark during the nine months ended september   crude oil moved into a mild state of backwardation meaning that the price of the near month crude oil futures contract was greater than the price of the next month crude oil futures contract and contracts further away from expiration crude oil inventories which reached historic levels in january  and february  and which appeared to be the primary cause of the steep level of contango began to drop in march  and continued to drop for the remainder of  and the beginning of  during the year ended december   crude oil inventories began to climb higher which contributed to the crude oil futures market remaining in contango through the end of december  during the nine months ended september   crude oil inventories began to draw down from present levels which contributed to the crude oil futures market moving into backwardation through the end of september  for a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns see term structure of crude oil prices and the impact on total returns below valuation of oil futures contracts and the computation of the per unit nav the per unit nav of usofs units is calculated once each nyse arca trading day the per unit nav for a particular trading day is released after  pm new york time trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at  pm new york time usofs administrator uses the nymex closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the nymex or  pm new york time for the contracts held on the nymex but calculates or determines the value of all other usof investments including ice futures contracts or other futures contracts as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or  pm new york time results of operations and the crude oil market results of operations on december   usof listed its units on the american stock exchange the amex under the ticker symbol usl on that day usof established its initial offering price at  per unit and issued  units to the initial authorized purchaser in exchange for  in cash as a result of the acquisition of the amex by nyse euronext usofs units no longer trade on the amex and commenced trading on the nyse arca on november   since its initial offering of  units usof has registered one subsequent offering of its units  units which were registered with the sec on march   units offered by usof in the subsequent offerings were sold by it for cash at the units per unit nav as described in the applicable prospectus as of september   usof had issued  units  of which were outstanding as of september   there were  units registered but not yet issued more units may have been issued by usof than are outstanding due to the redemption of units unlike funds that are registered under the investment company act of  as amended units that have been redeemed by usof cannot be resold by usof as a result usof contemplates that additional offerings of its units will be registered with the sec in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions    nov   c  cybernet data systems inc all

usl are located at  harrison street suite  oakland ca  the telephone number for both uscf and usl is  in order for a hypothetical investment in shares to break even over the next  months assuming a selling price of  the net asset value as of february   the investment would have to generate  return or  rounded to  usl is an exchange traded fund this means that most investors who decide to buy or sell shares of usl shares place their trade orders through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges shares trade on the nyse arca under the ticker symbol “usl” and are bought and sold throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other publicly traded securities shares trade on the nyse arca after they are initially purchased by “authorized participants” institutional firms that purchase shares in blocks of  shares called “baskets” through usl’s marketing agent alps distributors inc the “marketing agent” the price of a basket is equal to the net asset value “nav” of  shares on the day that the order to purchase the basket is accepted by the marketing agent the nav per share is calculated by taking the current market value of usl’s total assets after close of nyse arca subtracting any liabilities and dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares the offering of usl’s shares is a “best efforts” offering which means that neither the marketing agent nor any authorized participant is required to purchase a specific number or dollar amount of shares uscf pays the marketing agent a marketing fee consisting of a fixed annual amount plus an incentive fee based on the amount of shares sold authorized participants will not receive from usl uscf or any of their affiliates any fee or other compensation in connection with the sale of shares aggregate compensation paid to the marketing agent and any affiliate of uscf for distributionrelated services in connection with this offering of shares will not exceed ten percent  of the gross proceeds of the offering investors who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the underlying oil futures contracts in which usl invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to but not identical to the same forces influencing the prices of crude oil and the oil futures contracts that serve as usl’s investment benchmark investing in usl involves risks similar to those involved with an investment directly in the oil market

your financial condition permits you to participate in a commodity pool in so doing you should be aware that commodity interest trading can quickly lead to large losses as well as gains such trading losses can sharply reduce the net asset value of the pool and consequently the value of your interest in the pool in addition restrictions on redemptions may affect your ability to withdraw your participation in the pool further commodity pools may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory and brokerage fees it may be necessary for those pools that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets this disclosure document contains a complete description of each expense to be charged this pool at page

terms of the transaction and your circumstances in general however all swaps transactions involve some combination of market risk credit risk counterparty credit risk funding risk liquidity risk and operational risk highly customized swaps transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk which may result in a suspension of redemptions highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor in evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually

appendix a usl united states  month oil fund lp “usl” a delaware limited partnership is a commodity pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on the nyse arca stock exchange “nyse arca” usl is managed and controlled by united states commodity funds llc “uscf” a delaware limited liability company uscf is registered as a commodity pool operator “cpo” with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” and is a member of the national futures association “nfa” usl’s investment objective and strategy the investment objective of usl is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share net asset value “nav” to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light sweet crude oil delivered to cushing oklahoma as measured by the daily changes in the average of the prices of specified shortterm futures contracts on light sweet crude oil called the “benchmark oil futures contracts” less usl’s expenses what are the “benchmark oil futures contracts”   the benchmark oil futures contracts are the futures contracts on light sweet crude oil as traded on the new york mercantile exchange the “nymex” that is the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the following  months for a total of  consecutive months’ contracts except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the following  consecutive months when calculating the daily movement of the average price of the  contracts each contract month is equally weighted usl seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil other types of crude oil dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels that are traded on the nymex ice futures exchange or other us and foreign exchanges collectively “oil futures contracts” and to a lesser extent in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions other oilrelated investments such as cashsettled options on oil futures contracts forward contracts for oil cleared swap contracts and nonexchange traded “overthecounter” or “otc” transactions that are based on the price of oil other petroleumbased fuels oil futures contracts and indices based on the foregoing collectively “other oilrelated investments” market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause usl to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing usl to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing for convenience and unless otherwise specified oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments collectively are referred to as “oil interests” in this prospectus in addition uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in usl’s share price on the nyse arca on a percentage basis to closely track daily changes in usl’s per share nav on a percentage basis uscf further believes that the daily changes in the average prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts have historically closely tracked the daily changes in prices of light sweet crude oil uscf believes that the net effect of these relationships will be that the daily changes in the price of usl’s shares on the nyse arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the spot price of a barrel of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis less usl’s expenses specifically usl seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in usl’s nav for any period of  successive valuation days will be within plusminus ten percent  of the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contracts over the same period    investors should be aware that usl’s investment objective is not for its nav or market price of shares to equal in dollar terms the spot price of light sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light sweet crude oil nor is usl’s investment objective for the percentage change in its nav to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day  this is because natural market forces called contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in usl’s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of usl’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial principal investment risks of an investment in usl an investment in usl involves a degree of risk some of the risks you may face are summarized below a more extensive discussion of these risks appears beginning on page  investment risk investors may choose to use usl as a means of investing indirectly in crude oil there are significant risks and hazards inherent in the crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate correlation risk to the extent that investors use usl as a means of indirectly investing in crude oil there is the risk that the daily changes in the price of usl’s shares on the nyse arca on a percentage basis will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis this could happen if the price of shares traded on the nyse arca does not correlate closely with the value of usl’s nav the changes in usl’s nav do not correlate closely with the changes in the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts or the changes in the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts do not closely correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil this is a risk because if these correlations do not exist then investors may not be able to use usl as a costeffective way to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against the risk of loss in crude oilrelated transactions uscf believes that holding futures contracts whose expiration dates are spread out over a  month period of time will cause the total return of such a portfolio to vary compared to a portfolio that holds only a single month’s contract such as the near month contract in particular uscf believes that the total return of a portfolio holding contracts with a range of expiration months will be impacted differently by the price relationship between different contract months of the same commodity future compared to the total return of a portfolio consisting of the near month contract for example in cases in which the near month contract’s price is higher than the price of contracts that expire later in time a situation known as “backwardation” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the near month contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration conversely in cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower than the price of contracts that expire later in time a situation known as “contango” in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the near month contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration the total return of a portfolio that owned the near month contract and “rolled” forward each month by selling the near month contract as it approached expiration and purchasing the next month contract to expire would be positively impacted by a backwardation market and negatively impacted by a contango market depending on the exact price relationship of the different month’s prices portfolio expenses and the overall movement of crude oil prices the impact of backwardation and contango could have a major impact on the total return of such a portfolio over time uscf believes that based on historical evidence a portfolio that held futures contracts with a range of expiration dates spread out over a  month period of time would typically be impacted less by the positive effect of backwardation and the negative effect of contango compared to a portfolio that held contracts of a single near month as a result absent the impact of any other factors a portfolio of  different monthly contracts would tend to have a lower total return than a near month only portfolio in a backwardation market and a higher total return in a contango market however there can be no assurance that such historical relationships would provide the same or similar results in the future tax risk usl is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of its limited partnership agreement and applicable state law and therefore has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds    overthecounter “otc” contract risk usl may also invest in other oilrelated investments many of which are negotiated or “otc” contracts that are not as liquid as oil futures contracts and expose usl to credit risk that its counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to usl other risks usl pays fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it is profitable unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and distribute such income and gains to their investors usl generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other shareholders you should not invest in usl if you will need cash distributions from usl to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of usl if any or for any other reason you will have no rights to participate in the management of usl and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of uscf to manage usl usl is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf various commodity futures brokers and authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to usl uscf’s persons are directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with usl for their services including other commodity pools funds that uscf manages these funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “related public funds” and are identified in the glossary uscf could have a conflict between its responsibilities to usl and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with usl have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of usl and the shareholders usl’s fees and expenses this table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of usl you should note that you may pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of usl’s shares which are not reflected in the table authorized participants will pay applicable creation and redemption fees see

of average daily net assets    risk factors involved with an investment in usl you should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision you should also refer to the other information included in this prospectus as well as information found in our periodic reports which include usl’s financial statements and the related notes that are incorporated by reference see “incorporation by reference of certain information” page  usls investment objective is for the daily percentage changes in the nav per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of light sweet crude oil as measured by the daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts plus interest earned on usls collateral holdings less usls expenses usl seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in usls nav for any period of  successive valuation days will be within plusminus ten percent  of the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark oil futures contract over the same period usls investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a costeffective way to invest indirectly in crude oil and to hedge against movements in the spot price of light sweet crude oil an investment in usl involves investment risk similar to a direct investment in oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments and correlation risk or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil in addition to investment risk and correlation risk an investment in usl involves tax risks otc risks and other risks investment risk the nav of usl’s shares relates directly to the value of the benchmark oil futures contracts and other assets held by usl and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in usl’s shares past performance is not necessarily indicative of futures results all or substantially all of an investment in usl could be lost the net assets of usl consist primarily of investments in oil futures contracts and to a lesser extent in other oilrelated investments the nav of usl’s shares relates directly to the value of these assets less liabilities including accrued but unpaid expenses which in turn relates to the price of light sweet crude oil in the marketplace crude oil prices depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil economic conditions impacting light sweet crude oil  the demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on crude oil prices other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for crude oil sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for crude oil other light sweet crude oil demandrelated factors  other factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore its price include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for crude oil associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles other light sweet crude oil supplyrelated factors  crude oil prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil world oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries “opec” production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies    technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find produce and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for oil other factors impacting the light sweet crude oil market  the supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted by changes in interest rates inflation and other local or regional market conditions as well as by the development of alternative energy sources price volatility may possibly cause the total loss of your investment  futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes consequently you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in usl correlation risk investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil investing in usl’s shares for hedging purposes involves the following risks • the market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than nav • daily percentage changes in nav may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil future contracts • daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of light sweet crude oil the market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than nav usl’s nav per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of usl’s portfolio investments the public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the nav of the shares price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to but not identical to the same forces influencing the prices of the light sweet crude oil and the benchmark oil futures contract at any point in time uscf expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by authorized participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track nav per share closely over time but there can be no assurance of that the nav of usl’s shares may also be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between the nyse arca and the various futures exchanges on which crude oil is traded while the shares trade on the nyse arca from  am to  pm eastern time the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which sweet light crude oil trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time for example while the shares trade on the nyse arca until  pm eastern time liquidity in the global light sweet crude market will be reduced after the close of the nymex at  pm eastern time as a result during periods when the nyse arca is open and the futures exchanges on which sweet light crude oil is traded are closed trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and therefore increase the difference between the price of the shares and the nav of the shares daily percentage changes in usl’s nav may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts it is possible that the daily percentage changes in usl’s nav per share may not closely correlate to daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts noncorrelation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for light sweet crude oil the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges or other extraordinary circumstances as usl approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the benchmark oil futures contracts and other oil futures contracts or in view of market conditions usl may begin investing in other oilrelated investments in addition usl is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts because the total return generated by usl is reduced by expenses and transaction costs including those incurred in connection with usl’s trading activities and increased by interest income from usl’s holdings of treasuries defined below tracking the benchmark oil futures contracts requires trading of usl’s portfolio with a view to tracking the benchmark oil futures contracts over time and is dependent upon the skills of uscf and its trading principals among other factors    daily percentage changes in the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil the correlation between changes in the average prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only approximate the degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market supply of and demand for oil futures contracts including the benchmark oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments and technical influences in oil futures trading natural forces in the oil futures market known as “backwardation” and “contango” may increase usl’s tracking error andor negatively impact total return the design of usl’s benchmark oil futures contracts consists of the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the  following months which are changed to the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the  following months during one day each month in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts a situation described as “backwardation” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration conversely in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts a situation described as “contango” in the futures market then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration when compared to total return of other price indices such as the spot price of crude oil the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of usl’s per share nav to vary significantly moreover absent the impact of rising or falling oil prices a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on usl’s per share nav and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment see “additional information about usl its investment objective and investments” for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation accountability levels position limits and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts designated contract markets such as the nymex and ice futures have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge which an investment by usl is not may hold own or control in addition to accountability levels and position limits the nymex and ice futures also set daily price limits on futures contracts the daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit the accountability levels for the benchmark oil futures contracts and other oil futures contracts traded on usbased futures exchanges such as the nymex are not a fixed ceiling but rather a threshold above which the nymex may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor’s positions the current accountability level for investments for any onemonth in the benchmark oil futures contracts is  contracts in addition the nymex imposes an accountability level for all months of  net futures contracts for light sweet crude oil in addition the ice futures maintains the same accountability levels position limits and monitoring authority for its light sweet crude oil contract as the nymex if usl and the related public funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for light sweet crude oil the nymex and ice futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities including the total size of all positions investment and trading strategy and the extent of liquidity resources of usl and the related public funds if deemed necessary by the nymex andor ice futures usl could be ordered to reduce its net oil futures contracts back to the accountability level as of december   usl held  nymex crude oil futures cl contracts as of december   usl did not hold any oil futures contracts traded on the ice futures for the year ended december   usl did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the nymex or ice futures however the aggregated total of the related public funds did exceed the accountability levels no action was taken by nymex and usl did not reduce the number of oil futures contracts held as a result position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express cftc authority to do so in addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time the nymex and the ice futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire it is unlikely that usl will run up against such position limits because usl’s investment strategy is to close out its positions and “roll” from the near month contracts to expire to the next month contracts during a oneday period beginning two weeks from expiration of the contracts for the year ended december   usl did not exceed any position limits imposed by the nymex and ice futures    the cftc has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in  physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture energy and metals markets the “position limit rules” the position limit rules would among other things identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month other individual months and all months combined create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions impose responsibilities on designated contract markets “dcms” and swap execution facilities “sefs” to establish position limits or in some cases position accountability rules and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues otc dcms sefs as well as certain nonus located platforms the cftc’s first attempt at finalizing the position limit rules in  was successfully challenged by market participants in  and since then the cftc has reproposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times at this time it is unclear how the position limit rules may affect usl but the effect may be substantial and adverse by way of example the position limit rules may negatively impact the ability of usl to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit uscf’s ability to sell additional creation baskets of usl until such time as the position limit rules are adopted the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the position limit rules will govern transactions in commodities and related under that system the cftc enforces federal limits on speculation in nine agricultural products eg corn wheat and soy while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products eg oil and natural gas as a result usl may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits under existing and recently adopted cftc regulations for the purpose of position limits a market participant is generally required subject to certain narrow exceptions to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a  percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that market participant the “aggregation rules” the aggregation rules will also apply with respect to the position limit rules if and when such position limit rules are adopted all of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of usl’s shares and the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts this may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use usl as a way to hedge against crude oilrelated losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil usl has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase futures contracts and other oilrelated investments if usl encounters accountability levels position limits or price fluctuation limits for oil futures contracts on the nymex or ice futures it may then if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements purchase oil futures contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its investment objective in addition if usl exceeds accountability levels on either the nymex or ice futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of usl’s shares and the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts tax risk an investor’s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions if any on its shares cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of uscf uscf has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares investors will be required to pay us federal income tax and in some cases state local or foreign income tax on their allocable share of usl’s taxable income without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions therefore the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property if any distributed an investor’s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by usl in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors an investor’s allocable share of usl’s income gain deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year this difference could be temporary or permanent and if permanent could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income    items of income gain deduction loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated and for taxable periods beginning after december   usl could be liable for us federal income tax if the us internal revenue service “irs” does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by usl in allocating those items with potential adverse consequences for an investor the us tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large publicly traded partnerships such as usl is in many respects uncertain usl applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income gains deductions losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders’ economic gains and losses these assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the internal revenue code the “code” and applicable treasury regulations however and it is possible that the irs will successfully challenge usl’s allocation methods and require usl to reallocate items of income gain deduction loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors if this occurs investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest in addition for periods beginning after december   usl may be liable for us federal income tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an irs audit the amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor if usl is required to pay any us federal income taxes on any imputed understatement the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of usl and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares under certain circumstances usl may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement including any interest and penalties the ability of a publicly traded partnership such as usl to make this election is uncertain if the election is made usl would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment “adjusted ks” the investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the adjusted ks are issued usl could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes which may substantially reduce the value of the shares usl has received an opinion of counsel that under current us federal income tax laws usl will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes provided that i at least  percent of usl’s annual gross income will be derived from x income and gains from commodities not held as inventory or futures forwards options swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities and y interest income ii usl is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and iii usl does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes although uscf anticipates that usl has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the “qualifying income” requirement for all of its taxable years that result cannot be assured usl has not requested and will not request any ruling from the irs with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the irs were to successfully assert that usl is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year rather than passing through its income gains losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders usl would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates in addition although uscf does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to shares any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income taxation of usl as a corporation could materially reduce the aftertax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares usl is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the lp agreement and applicable state law and therefore usl has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds usl is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the lp agreement and applicable state law no us federal income tax is paid by usl on its income instead usl will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on irs schedule k form  and each us shareholder is required to report on its us federal income tax return its allocable share of the income gain loss and deduction of usl this must be reported without regard to the amount if any of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from usl during the taxable year a shareholder therefore may be allocated income or gain by usl but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability    in addition to federal income taxes shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as state and local income taxes unincorporated business taxes business franchise taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which usl does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in usl it is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate us federal state local and foreign tax returns if usl is required to withhold tax with respect to any nonus shareholders the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders under certain circumstances usl may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to nonus shareholders although the lp agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the nonus shareholder usl may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the nonus shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since it does not generally expect to make any distributions under such circumstances the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all shareholders not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld this could have a material impact on the value of the shares otc contract risk currently otc transactions are subject to changing regulation a portion of usl’s assets may be used to trade otc contracts such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts otc contracts are typically contracts traded on a principaltoprincipal noncleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions the markets for otc contracts have relied upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the cftc on participants in the futures markets while certain regulations adopted over the past several years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the otc market complying with such regulations could have substantial and adverse effects on usl usl will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to otc contracts entered into by usl or held by special purpose or structured vehicles usl faces the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to the otc contracts unlike in futures contracts the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions as a result there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions a counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to usl in which case usl could suffer significant losses on these contracts if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties usl may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding usl may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances valuing otc derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments in general valuing otc derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such otc derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources in addition while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating otc contracts they typically are not contractually obligated to do so particularly if they are not a party to the transaction as a result it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding otc derivatives transaction other risks certain of usl’s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market a market disruption such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency its crude oil production or exports or another major export can also make it difficult to liquidate a position because both futures contracts and other oilrelated investments may be illiquid usl’s oil interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated the large size of the positions that usl may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so    otc contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange do not have uniform terms and conditions and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support such as collateral and in general they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty these conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact usl’s ability to realize the full value of such contracts in addition even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk sudden changes in the value of otc transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party’s exposure on the transaction in such situations usl is not actively managed and tracks the benchmark oil futures contracts during periods in which the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts are flat or declining as well as when the prices are rising usl is not actively managed by conventional methods accordingly if usl’s investments in oil interests are declining in value usl will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an authorized participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in a benchmark oil futures contract uscf will seek to cause the nav of usl’s shares to track the benchmark oil futures contracts during periods in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising the nyse arca may halt trading in usl’s shares which would adversely impact an investor’s ability to sell shares usl’s shares are listed for trading on the nyse arca under the market symbol “usl” trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or in light of nyse arca rules and procedures for reasons that in the view of the nyse arca make trading in shares inadvisable in addition trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline additionally there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of usl’s shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged the liquidity of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of authorized participants which could adversely affect the market price of the shares in the event that one or more authorized participants which have substantial interests in the shares withdraw from participation the liquidity of the shares will likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of the shares and result in investors incurring a loss on their investment shareholders that are not authorized participants may only purchase or sell their shares in secondary trading markets and the conditions associated with trading in secondary markets may adversely affect investors’ investment in the shares only authorized participants may create or redeem redemption baskets all other investors that desire to purchase or sell shares must do so through the nyse arca or in other markets if any in which the shares may be traded shares may trade at a premium or discount to nav per share the lack of an active trading market for usl’s shares may result in losses on an investor’s investment in usl at the time the investor sells the shares although usl’s shares are listed and traded on the nyse arca there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained if an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares assuming they were able to be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed limited partners may have limited liability in certain circumstances including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions under delaware law a limited partner might be held liable for usl’s obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership’s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner    a limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of usl’s shares however a limited partner may be required to repay to usl any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances under delaware law usl may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes usl’s liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities to exceed the fair value of usl’s assets delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution the llc agreement provides limited authority to the nonmanagement directors and any director of uscf may be removed by uscf’s parent company which is wholly owned by concierge a controlled public company where the majority of shares are owned by nicholas gerber along with certain other family members and certain other shareholders uscf’s board of directors currently consists of four management directors each of whom are also executive officers or employees of uscf and three nonmanagement directors each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable nyse arca and sec rules under uscf’s llc agreement the nonmanagement directors have only such authority as the management directors expressly confer upon them which means that the nonmanagement directors may have less authority to control the actions of the management directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company’s board of directors in addition any director may be removed by written consent of wainwright holdings inc “wainwright” which is the sole member of uscf the sole shareholder of wainwright is concierge technologies inc a company publicly traded under the ticker symbol “cncg” “concierge” mr nicholas gerber along with certain family members and certain other shareholders own the majority of the shares in concierge which is the sole shareholder of wainright the sole member of uscf accordingly although uscf is governed by the uscf board of directors which consists of both management directors and nonmanagement directors pursuant to the llc agreement it is possible for mr gerber to exercise his indirect control of wainwright to effect the removal of any director including the nonmanagement directors which comprise the audit committee and to replace that director with another director having control in one person could have a negative impact on uscf and usl including their regulatory obligations there is a risk that usl will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such usl may not earn any profit usl pays brokerage charges of approximately  of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of  per buy or sell management fees of  of nav on its average net assets and otc spreads and extraordinary expenses eg subsequent offering expenses other expenses not in the ordinary course of business including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the lp agreement and under agreements entered into by uscf on usl’s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation that cannot be quantified  these fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether usl’s activities are profitable accordingly usl must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect usl the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states in addition various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on usl is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse an investment in usl may provide little or no diversification benefits thus in a declining market usl may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in usl while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes historically futures contracts and other oilrelated investments have generally been noncorrelated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds noncorrelation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand    however there can be no assurance that such noncorrelation will continue during future periods if contrary to historic patterns usl’s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in usl’s shares in such a case usl may have no gains to offset losses from other investments and investors may suffer losses on their investment in usl at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments variables such as drought floods weather embargoes tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and crude oillinked instruments including futures contracts and other oilrelated investments than on traditional securities these additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject usl’s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities noncorrelation should not be confused with negative correlation where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other there is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets such as stocks and bonds are negatively correlated in the absence of negative correlation usl cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market or vice versa usl is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the  act usl is not an investment company subject to the  act accordingly investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which for example requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager trading in international markets could expose usl to credit and regulatory risk usl invests primarily in oil futures contracts a significant portion of which are traded on united states exchanges including the nymex however a portion of usl’s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the united states some nonus markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts trading on such nonus markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts including potentially different or diminished investor protections in trading contracts denominated in currencies other than us dollars usl is subject to the risk of adverse exchangerate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts  additionally trading on nonus exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls expropriation increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability an adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets usl and uscf may have conflicts of interest which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders usl is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving uscf various commodity futures brokers and authorized participants uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to usl and are also directors officers or employees of other entities that may compete with usl for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to usl and to those other entities as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with usl have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of usl and the shareholders uscf has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest consequently investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably although uscf attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for uscf to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the shareholders usl may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the futures commission merchant “fcm” including but not limited to conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the fcm in addition uscf’s principals officers directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account a conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as usl trades using the clearing broker to be used by usl a potential conflict also may occur if uscf’s principals officers directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite or ahead of the positions taken by usl    usl could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio usl may terminate at any time regardless of whether usl has incurred losses subject to the terms of the lp agreement in particular unforeseen circumstances including the adjudication of incompetence bankruptcy dissolution or removal of uscf as the general partner of usl could cause usl to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within  days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions however no level of losses will require uscf to terminate usl usl’s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio usl does not expect to make cash distributions usl has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional oil interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners or other shareholders therefore unlike mutual funds commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors usl generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners an investor should not invest in usl if the investor will need cash distributions from usl to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of usl if any or for any other reason nonetheless although usl does not intend to make cash distributions the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution eg at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in oil interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax if this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made an unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on usl’s nav if a substantial number of requests for redemption of redemption baskets are received by usl during a relatively short period of time usl may not be able to satisfy the requests from usl’s assets not committed to trading as a consequence it could be necessary to liquidate positions in usl’s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation money market reform the sec adopted rule a under the  act on july   which became effective on october   to reform money market funds “mmfs” while the new rule applies only to mmfs it may indirectly affect institutional investors such as usl the new rule requires institutional prime mmfs to price their shares using marketbased values instead of the amortized cost method ie to use a “floating net asset value per share” or “floating nav” government and retail funds can continue to use the amortized cost method to value their portfolio securities additionally liquidity fees and gates allow an mmf’s board of directors to directly address runs on a fund mmfs’ boards of directors are required to implement rules to discourage and prevent runs by investors through the use of redemption fees and gates temporary suspension of redemptions the fees and gates could be imposed on a fund whose portfolios fail to meet certain liquidity thresholds although they are optional for government mmfs usl currently invests in government mmfs as well as treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less as an investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the oil futures contracts usl does not hold any nongovernment mmfs and currently does not anticipate investing in any nongovernment mmfs the new rule further decreases the likelihood that usl would invest in any nongovernmental mmfs however if usl were to make investments in nongovernment mmfs in the future such investments could negatively impact usl because of the changes to mmfs resulting from the new rule     the failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in a substantial loss of usl’s assets and could impair usl in its ability to execute trades in the event of the bankruptcy of a clearing broker or an exchange’s clearing house usl could be exposed to a risk of loss with respect to its assets that are posted as margin if such a bankruptcy were to occur usl would be afforded the protections granted to customers of an fcm and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house under the united states bankruptcy code and applicable cftc regulations such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property held by the bankrupt fcm or an exchange’s clearing house if the customer property held by the fcm or the exchange’s clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims in any case there can be no assurance that these protections will be effective in allowing usl to recover all or even any of the amounts it has deposited as margin    on january   new regulations became effective relating to enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and  examination programs for fcms there can be no assurance that the implementation of these regulations will prevent losses to or not materially adversely affect usl or its investors notwithstanding that usl could sustain losses upon the failure or bankruptcy of its fcm the majority of usl’s assets are held in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents with the custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of an fcm the failure or bankruptcy of usl’s custodian could result in a substantial loss of usl’s assets the majority of usl’s assets are held in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents with the custodian the insolvency of the custodian could result in a complete loss of usl’s assets held by that custodian which at any given time would likely comprise a substantial portion of usl’s total assets third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that uscf has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights which may result in significant costs and diverted attention it is possible that third parties might utilize usl’s intellectual property or technology including the use of its business methods trademarks and trading program software without permission uscf has a patent for usl’s business method and has registered its trademarks usl does not currently have any proprietary software however if it obtains proprietary software in the future any unauthorized use of usl’s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage usl may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents trademarks proprietary software and other technology also third parties may independently develop business methods trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of uscf or claim that uscf has violated their intellectual property rights including their copyrights trademark rights trade names trade secrets and patent rights as a result uscf may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets determine the validity and scope of other parties’ proprietary rights defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid any litigation of this type even if uscf is successful and regardless of the merits may result in significant costs divert its resources from usl or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements due to the increased use of technologies intentional and unintentional cyberattacks pose operational and information security risks with the increased use of technologies such as the internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions usl is susceptible to operational and information security risks in general cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events cyberattacks include but are not limited to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as causing denialofservice attacks on websites cyber security failures or breaches of usl’s clearing broker or third party service provider including but not limited to index providers the administrator and transfer agent the custodian have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations potentially resulting in financial losses the inability of usl shareholders to transact business violations of applicable privacy and other laws regulatory fines penalties reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs in addition substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future usl and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result while usl has established business continuity plans there are inherent limitations in such plans additional information about usl its investment objective and investments usl is a delaware limited partnership organized on june   it operates pursuant to the terms of the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership dated as of march   as amended from time to time the “lp agreement” which grants full management control of usl to uscf usl maintains its main business office at  harrison street suite  oakland ca  the net assets of usl consist primarily of investments in oil futures contracts and to a lesser extent in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions other oilrelated investments market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause usl to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing usl to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing    usl invests substantially the entire amount if its assets in oil futures contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in shortterm obligations of the united states of two years or less “treasuries” cash and cash equivalents the daily holdings of usl are available on usl’s website at wwwuscfinvestmentscom  usl invests in oil interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in oil interests in pursuing this objective the primary focus of uscf is the investment in oil futures contracts and the management of usl’s investments in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral usl seeks to invest in a combination of oil interests such that the daily changes in its nav measured in percentage terms will closely track the daily changes in the price of the benchmark oil futures contracts also measured in percentage terms as a specific benchmark uscf endeavors to place usl’s trades in oil interests and otherwise manage usl’s investments so that “a” will be within plus minus ten percent  of “b” where • a is the average daily percentage change in usl’s per share nav for any period of  successive valuation days ie  any nyse arca trading day as of which usl calculates its per share nav and • b is the average daily percentage change in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts over the same period uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in usl’s share price on the nyse arca to closely track the daily changes in usl’s nav per share uscf further believes that the daily changes in usl’s nav in percentage terms will closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts less usl’s expenses the following two graphs demonstrate the correlation between the changes in usl’s nav and the changes in the benchmark oil futures contract the first graph exhibits the daily changes in the last  valuation days ended december   the second graph measures monthly changes from december   through december     past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results    past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results uscf employs a “neutral” investment strategy in order to track changes in the average prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts regardless of whether these prices go up or go down usl’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell usl’s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in a costeffective manner andor to permit participants in the oil or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oilrelated transactions accordingly depending on the investment objective of an individual investor the risks generally associated with investing in crude oil andor the risks involved in hedging may exist in addition an investment in usl involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of usl’s shares in percentage terms will not accurately track the daily changes in the average prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts in percentage terms and that daily changes in the benchmark oil futures contracts in percentage terms will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil in percentage terms as an example for the two months ended february   the actual total return of usl as measured by changes in its per share nav was  this is based on an initial per share nav of  as of december   and an ending per share nav as of february   of  during this time period usl made no distributions to its shareholders however if usls daily changes in its per share nav had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the benchmark futures contract usl would have had an estimated per share nav of  as of february   for a total return over the relevant time period of  the difference between the actual per share nav total return of usl of  and the expected total return based on the benchmark futures contracts of  was an error over the time period of  which is to say that usls actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage usl incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts and other expenses the impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share nav of usl to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract impact of contango and backwardation on total returns several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts one factor arises from “rolling” futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month the “near” or “front” month contract forward each month prior to expiration for a strategy that entails holding the near month contract the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns for example if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract a situation referred to as “backwardation” then absent any other change the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration conversely if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract a situation referred to as “contango” then absent any other change the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration    as an example assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery is  per barrel and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also  over time the price of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors including demand for oil relative to supply the value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors if an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical barrels of crude oil the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract in order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract this “roll” forward of the futures contract must be executed every month contango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in usl’s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil in the future it is likely that the relationship between the market price of usl’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light sweet crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation it is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil which could be substantial if the futures market is in backwardation eg when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract assuming the price of the next month futures contract was  per barrel or  cheaper than the  near month futures contract then hypothetically and assuming no other changes eg to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash andor cash equivalents the value of the  next month futures contract would rise to  as it approaches expiration in this example the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of crude oil as a result it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise  while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a lower amount eg only  similarly the spot price of crude oil could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount eg only  over time if backwardation remained constant this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase if the futures market is in contango an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract again assuming the near month futures contract is  per barrel the price of the next month futures contract might be  per barrel or  more expensive than the front month futures contract hypothetically and assuming no other changes the value of the  next month futures contract would fall to  as it approaches expiration in this example the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of crude oil as a result it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only  while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a higher amount eg  similarly the spot price of crude oil could have fallen  while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount eg  over time if contango remained constant this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase the chart below compares the daily price of the near month crude oil futures contract to the price of th month crude oil futures contract ie a contract one year forward over the last  years when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the th month futures contract the market would be described as being in backwardation when the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the th month futures contract the market would be described as being in contango although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the th month futures contract tend to move together it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the th month futures contract prices backwardation and at other times the near month futures contract prices are lower than the th month futures contract prices contango        past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results an alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the th month crude oil futures contract from the dollar price of the near month crude oil futures contract as shown in the chart below when the difference is positive the market is in backwardation when the difference is negative the market is in contango the crude oil market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years    past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results an investment in a portfolio that owned only the near month crude oil futures contract would likely produce a different result than an investment in a portfolio that owned an equal number of each of the near  months’ of crude oil futures contracts generally speaking when the crude oil futures market is in backwardation a portfolio of only the near month crude oil futures contract may tend to have a higher total return than a portfolio of  months’ of the crude oil futures contract conversely if the crude oil futures market was in contango the portfolio containing only  months’ of crude oil futures contracts may tend to outperform the portfolio holding only the near month crude oil futures contract historically the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in  following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of  the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years during parts of  the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack us and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the physical transportation and storage of crude oil at cushing oklahoma the primary pricing point for oil traded in the us led to unusually high inventories of crude oil a combination of improved transportation and storage capacity along with growing demand for crude oil globally moderated the inventory buildup and lead to reduced levels of contango by  however at the end of november  global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after opec decided to defend its market share against us shaleoil producers resulting in another period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango sometimes steep contango this period of contango continued through december   in addition the crude oil markets are expected to remain in contango until us and global oil inventories decline significantly if opec’s recent cuts in oil production have their intended effect on the crude oil market then such a decline may occur in     uscf believes that holding futures contracts whose expiration dates are spread out over a  month period of time will cause the total return of such a portfolio to vary compared to a portfolio that holds only a single month’s contract such as the near month contract in particular uscf believes that the total return of a portfolio holding contracts with a range of expiration months will be impacted differently by the price relationship between different contract months of the same commodity future compared to the total return of a portfolio consisting of the near month contract uscf believes that based on historical evidence a portfolio that held futures contracts with a range of expiration dates spread out over a  month period of time would typically be impacted less by the positive effect of backwardation and less by the negative effect of contango compared to a portfolio that held contracts of a single near month as a result absent the impact of any other factors a portfolio of  different monthly contracts would tend to have a lower total return than a near month only portfolio in a backwardation market and a higher total return in a contango market however there can be no assurance that such historical relationships would provide the same or similar results in the future periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact usl’s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share nav track the daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the benchmark oil futures contracts since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both usl’s shares and the benchmark oil futures contracts it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future it is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods in managing usl’s assets uscf does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders uscf instead employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a creation basket is sold uscf purchases oil interests such as the benchmark oil futures contracts that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of treasuries andor cash received upon the issuance of the creation basket the specific oil futures contracts purchased depend on various factors including a judgment by uscf as to the appropriate diversification of usl’s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts in addition usl may make use of a mixture of standard sized futures contracts as well as the smaller sized “mini” contracts while uscf has made significant investments in nymex oil futures contracts for various reasons including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting usl’s holdings and market conditions it may invest in futures contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in other oilrelated investments to the extent that usl invests in other oilrelated investments it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the benchmark oil futures contracts including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria and then to a lesser extent it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts instruments and noncleared swaps such as swaps in the overthecounter market or commonly referred to as the “otc market” if usl is required by law or regulation or by one of its regulators including a futures exchange to reduce its position in the futures contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in other oilrelated investments a substantial portion of usl’s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments that are intended to replicate the return on the futures contracts as usl’s assets reach higher levels it is more likely to exceed position limits accountability levels or other regulatory limits and as a result it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in other oilrelated investments at such higher levels in addition market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause usl to invest in other oilrelated investments include those allowing usl to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing see “risk factors involved with an investment in usl” for a discussion of the potential impact of the regulation on usl’s ability to invest in otc transactions and cleared swaps uscf may not be able to fully invest usl’s assets in the oil futures contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to usl’s nav for example as standardized contracts the futures contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity and usl’s nav and the proceeds from the sale of a creation basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts as a result in such circumstances usl may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contracts through the use of other oilrelated investments such as otc contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the benchmark oil futures contracts usl anticipates that to the extent it invests in oil futures contracts other than contracts on light sweet crude oil such as futures contracts for dieselheating oil natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels and other oilrelated investments it will enter into various nonexchangetraded derivative contracts to hedge the shortterm price movements of such oil futures contracts and other oilrelated investments against the current benchmark oil futures contracts    uscf does not anticipate letting usl’s oil futures contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity instead uscf closes existing positions eg when it changes the benchmark oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments positions may also be closed out to meet orders for redemption baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested the benchmark oil futures contracts are changed from the near month contract to expire and the  following months to the next month contract to expire and the  following months during one day each month on that day uscf “rolls” usl’s positions by closing or selling usl’s oil interests and reinvests the proceeds from closing these positions in new oil interests the anticipated dates on which the benchmark oil futures contracts are changed and usl’s oil interests are “rolled” will be posted on usl’s website at wwwuscfinvestmentscom and are subject to change without notice by remaining invested as fully as possible in oil futures contracts or other oilrelated investments uscf believes that the changes in percentage terms in usl’s per share nav will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the average of the prices of the price of the benchmark oil futures contracts uscf believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the nyse arca closely tracking the per share nav of usl additionally oil futures contracts traded on the nymex have closely tracked the spot price of light sweet crude oil based on these expected interrelationships uscf believes that the changes in the price of usl’s shares traded on the nyse arca have closely tracked on a daily basis and will continue to closely track the changes in the spot price of light sweet crude oil on a percentage basis what are the trading policies of usl liquidity usl invests only in futures contracts and other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in other oilrelated investments that in the opinion of uscf may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of usl spot commodities while the oil futures contracts traded can be physically settled usl does not intend to take or make physical delivery usl may from time to time trade in other oilrelated investments including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil leverage uscf endeavors to have the value of usl’s treasuries cash and cash equivalents whether held by usl or posted as margin or other collateral at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its oil interests commodity pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract’s or other commodity interest’s entire market value while uscf has not and does not intend to leverage usl’s assets it is not prohibited from doing so under the lp agreement borrowings borrowings are not used by usl unless usl is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery if usl trades in cash commodities or for shortterm needs created by unexpected redemptions otc derivatives including spreads and straddles in addition to oil futures contracts there are also a number of listed options on the oil futures contracts on the principal futures exchanges these contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market consequently usl may purchase options on crude oil futures contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective    in addition to the oil futures contracts and options on the oil futures contracts there also exists an active nonexchangetraded market in derivatives tied to crude oil these derivatives transactions also known as otc contracts are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts unlike most of the exchangetraded oil futures contracts or exchangetraded options on the oil futures contracts each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party ie  the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract to reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts usl will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the master agreement published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc “isda” that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty uscf assesses or reviews as appropriate the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an otc contract pursuant to guidelines approved by uscf’s board usl may enter into certain transactions where an otc component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract “exchange for related position” or “efrp” transactions in the most common type of efrp transaction entered into by usl the otc component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of usl shares these efrp transactions may expose usl to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the otc component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract generally the counterparty risk from the efrp transaction will exist only on the day of execution usl may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the benchmark oil futures contract usl would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset but with different delivery months during all of  and through february   usl limited its derivatives activities to oil futures contracts and efrp transactions usl did not engage in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange or forward contracts including options on such contracts usl does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange forward contracts or options on such contracts but it may do so as outlined in usl’s listing exemptive order or as permitted under current regulations pyramiding usl has not and will not employ the technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest prior performance of usl past performance is not necessarily

 range established as its benchmark tracking goal  the table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily nav of usl since inception through february   the first row shows the average amount of the variation between usl’s closing market price and nav computed on a daily basis since inception while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the end of day premiums and discounts to nav since inception on a percentage basis uscf believes that maximum and minimum end of day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the nyse arca until  pm new york time while regular trading in the benchmark futures contracts on the nymex ceases at  pm new york time and the value of the relevant benchmark futures contracts for purposes of determining its end of day nav can be determined at that time        usl   average difference      max premium       max discount                 for more information

there are present and potential future conflicts of interest in usl’s structure and operation you should consider before you purchase shares uscf will use this notice of conflicts as a defense against any claim or other proceeding made if uscf is not able to resolve these conflicts of interest adequately it may impact usl’s and the related public funds’ ability to achieve their investment objectives usl and uscf may have inherent conflicts to the extent uscf attempts to maintain usl’s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with usl’s objective of having the value of its share’s nav track changes in the average price of the benchmark oil futures contracts uscf’s officers directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to usl these persons are directors officers or employees of other entities which may compete with usl for their services they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to usl and to those other entities uscf has adopted policies that prohibit their principals officers directors and employees from trading futures and related contracts in which either usl or any of the related public funds invests these policies are intended to prevent conflicts of interest occurring where uscf or their principals officers directors or employees could give preferential treatment to their own accounts or trade their own accounts ahead of or against usl or any of the related public funds uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of usl and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests which may create a conflict with your best interests limited partners have limited voting control which will limit their ability to influence matters such as amendment of the lp agreement change in usl’s basic investment policy dissolution of this fund or the sale or distribution of usl’s assets uscf serves as general partner or sponsor to each of usl and the related public funds ucco and the rex funds uscf may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for usl may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages by way of example if as a result of reaching position limits imposed by the nymex usl purchased gasoline futures contracts this decision could impact usl’s ability to purchase additional gasoline futures contracts if the number of contracts held by funds managed by uscf reached the maximum allowed by the nymex similar situations could adversely affect the ability of any fund to track its benchmark futures contract in addition uscf is required to indemnify the officers and directors of the other funds if the need for indemnification arises this potential indemnification will cause uscf’s assets to decrease if uscf’s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification then uscf may terminate and you could lose your investment whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between uscf on the one hand and the partnership or any limited partner on the other hand any resolution or course of action by uscf in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all partners and shall not constitute a breach of the lp agreement or of any other agreement or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity if the resolution or course of action is or by operation of the lp agreement is deemed to be fair and reasonable to the partnership if a dispute arises under the lp agreement it will be resolved either through negotiations with uscf or by courts located in the state of delaware under the lp agreement any resolution is deemed to be fair and reasonable to the partnership if the resolution is • approved by the audit committee although no party is obligated to seek approval and uscf may adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received approval • on terms no less favorable to the

eliminate fiduciary duties in a limited partnership agreement to the limited partnership itself or to another partner or person otherwise bound by the limited partnership agreement parties may not however eliminate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where parties unambiguously provide for fiduciary duties in a limited partnership agreement those expressed duties become the standard that courts will use to determine whether such duties were breached for this reason usl’s limited partnership agreement does not explicitly provide for any fiduciary duties so that common law fiduciary duty principles will apply to measure uscf’s conduct a prospective investor should be aware that uscf has a responsibility to limited partners of usl to exercise good faith and fairness in all dealings the fiduciary responsibility of a general partner to limited partners is a developing and changing area of the law and limited partners who have questions concerning the duties of uscf

usl and the us federal income tax treatment of usl as of the date hereof this discussion is applicable to a beneficial owner of shares who purchases shares in the offering to which this prospectus relates including a beneficial owner who purchases shares from an authorized participant except where noted otherwise it deals only with shares held as capital assets and does not deal with special situations such as those of dealers in securities or currencies financial institutions taxexempt entities insurance companies persons holding shares as a part of a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “hedging” “conversion” or other integrated transaction for federal income tax purposes traders in securities or commodities that elect to use a marktomarket method of accounting or holders of shares whose “functional currency” is not the us dollar furthermore the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the code as amended and regulations “treasury regulations” rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof and such authorities may be repealed revoked or modified so as to result in us federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below    persons considering the purchase ownership or disposition of shares should consult their own tax advisors concerning the united states federal income tax consequences in light of their particular situations as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction as used herein a “us shareholder” of a share means a beneficial owner of a share that is a us person a “us person” for united states federal income tax purposes is i a citizen or resident of the united states ii a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof iii an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or iv a trust x that is subject to the supervision of a court within the united states and the control of one or more united states persons as described in section a of the code or y that has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a united states person a “nonus shareholder” is a holder that is not a us shareholder and a “nonus person” is an individual or entity that is not a us person if a partnership holds our shares the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership if you are a partner of a partnership holding our shares you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences usl has received the opinion of eversheds sutherland us llp counsel to usl that the material us federal income tax consequences to usl and to us shareholders and nonus shareholders will be as described below in rendering its opinion eversheds sutherland us llp has relied on the facts described in this prospectus as well as certain factual representations made by usl and uscf the opinion of eversheds sutherland us llp is not binding on the irs and as a result the irs may not agree with the tax positions taken by usl if challenged by the irs usl’s tax positions might not be sustained by the courts no ruling has been requested from the irs with respect to any matter affecting usl or prospective investors each prospective investor is advised to consult its own tax advisor as to how us federal income tax consequences of an investment in usl apply to you and as to how the applicable state local or foreign taxes apply to you tax status of usl usl is organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the lp agreement and applicable state law under the code an entity classified as a partnership that is deemed to be a “publicly traded partnership” is generally taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes the code provides an exception to this general rule for a publicly traded partnership whose gross income for each taxable year of its existence consists of at least  “qualifying income” “qualifying income exception” for this purpose section  defines “qualifying income” as including in pertinent part interest other than from a financial business dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends in addition in the case of a partnership a principal activity of which is the buying and selling of commodities other than as inventory or of futures forwards and options with respect to commodities “qualifying income” includes income and gains from such commodities and futures forwards and options with respect to commodities usl and uscf have represented the following to eversheds sutherland us llp • at least  of usl’s gross income for each taxable year will be derived from i income and gains from commodities not held as inventory or futures forwards options swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities and ii interest income • usl is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law • usl has not elected and will not elect to be classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes based in part on these representations eversheds sutherland us llp is of the opinion that usl will be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and that it is not taxable as a corporation for such purposes usl’s taxation as a partnership rather than a corporation will require uscf to conduct usl’s business activities in such a manner that it satisfies the qualifying income exception on a continuing basis no assurance can be given that usl’s operations for any given year will produce income that satisfies the requirements of the qualifying income exception eversheds sutherland us llp will not review usl’s ongoing compliance with these requirements and will have no obligation to advise usl or usl’s shareholders in the event of any subsequent change in the facts representations or applicable law relied upon in reaching its opinion    if usl failed to satisfy the qualifying income exception in any year other than a failure that is determined by the irs to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery usl would be taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes and would pay federal income tax on its income at regular corporate rates in that event shareholders would not report their share of usl’s income or loss on their returns in addition distributions to shareholders would be treated as dividends to the extent of usl’s current and accumulated earnings and profits subject to holding period and other requirements any such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to us federal income tax at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to longterm capital gains to the extent a distribution exceeded usl’s earnings and profits the distribution would be treated as a return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in its shares and thereafter as gain from the sale of shares accordingly if usl were to be taxable as a corporation it would likely have a material adverse effect on the economic return from an investment in usl and on the value of the shares the remainder of this summary assumes that usl is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and that it is not taxable as a corporation us shareholders tax consequences of ownership of shares taxation of usl’s income no us federal income tax is paid by usl on its income instead usl files annual information returns and each us shareholder is required to report on its us federal income tax return its allocable share of the income gain loss deduction and credit of usl for example shareholders must take into account their share of ordinary income realized by usl from accruals of interest on treasuries and other investments and their share of gain from oil interests these items must be reported without regard to the amount if any of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from usl during the taxable year consequently a shareholder may be allocated income or gain by usl but receive no cash distribution with which to pay its tax liability resulting from the allocation or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability because uscf currently does not intend to make distributions it is likely that in any year usl realizes net income andor gain that a us shareholder will be required to pay taxes on its allocable share of such income or gain from sources other than usl distributions in addition individuals with income in excess of   in the case of married individuals filing jointly and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional  tax on their “net investment income” which generally includes net income from interest dividends annuities royalties and rents and net capital gains other than certain amounts earned from trades or businesses the income subject to the additional  tax includes any income from businesses involved in the trading of financial instruments or commodities allocations of usl’s profit and loss under code section  the determination of a partner’s distributive share of any item of income gain loss deduction or credit is governed by the applicable organizational document unless the allocation provided by such document lacks “substantial economic effect” an allocation that lacks substantial economic effect nonetheless will be respected if it is in accordance with the partners’ interests in the partnership determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangements among the partners in general usl applies a monthly closingofthebooks convention in determining allocations of economic profit or loss to shareholders income gain loss and deduction are determined on a monthly “marktomarket” basis taking into account our accrued income and deductions and realized and unrealized gains and losses for the month these items are allocated among the holders of shares in proportion to the number of shares owned by them as of the close of business on the last business day of the prior month items of taxable income deduction gain loss and credit recognized by usl for federal income tax purposes for any taxable year are allocated among holders in a manner that equitably reflects the allocation of economic profit or loss usl has made the election permitted by section  of the code which election is irrevocable without the consent of the service the effect of this election is that in connection with secondary market sales we adjust the purchaser’s proportionate share of the tax basis of our assets to fair market value as reflected in the price paid for the shares as if the purchaser had directly acquired an interest in our assets the section  election is intended to eliminate disparities between a partner’s basis in its partnership interest and its share of the tax bases of the partnership’s assets so that the partner’s allocable share of taxable gain or loss on a disposition of an asset will correspond to its share of the appreciation or depreciation in the value of the asset since it acquired its interest depending on the price paid for shares and the tax bases of usl’s assets at the time of the purchase the effect of the section  election on a purchaser of shares may be favorable or unfavorable    usl applies certain conventions in determining and allocating items for tax purposes in order to reduce the complexity and costs of administration uscf believes that application of these conventions is consistent with the intent of the partnership provisions of the code and the applicable treasury regulations and that the resulting allocations will have substantial economic effect or otherwise are respected as being in accordance with shareholders’ interests in usl for federal income tax purposes the code and existing treasury regulations do not expressly permit adoption of these conventions although the monthly allocation convention described above is consistent with methods permitted under the applicable treasury regulations as well as the legislative history for the provisions that requires allocations to appropriately reflect changes in ownership interest it is possible that the irs could successfully challenge this method and require a shareholder to report a greater or lesser share of items of income gain loss deduction or credit than if our method were respected uscf is authorized to revise our allocation method to conform to any method permitted under future treasury regulations the assumptions and conventions used in making tax allocations may cause a shareholder to be allocated more or less income or loss for federal income tax purposes than its proportionate share of the economic income or loss realized by usl during the period it held its shares this “mismatch” between taxable and economic income or loss in some cases may be temporary reversing itself in a later period when the shares are sold but could be permanent mark to market of certain exchangetraded contracts for federal income tax purposes usl generally is required to use a “marktomarket” method of accounting under which unrealized gains and losses on instruments constituting “section  contracts” are recognized currently a section  contract is defined as  a futures contract that is traded on or subject to the rules of a national securities exchange which is registered with the sec a domestic board of trade designated as a contract market by the cftc or any other board of trade or exchange designated by the secretary of the treasury and with respect to which the amount required to be deposited and the amount that may be withdrawn depends on a system of “marking to market”  a forward contract on exchangetraded foreign currencies where the contracts are traded in the interbank market  a nonequity option traded on or subject to the rules of a qualified board or exchange  a dealer equity option or  a dealer securities futures contract under these rules section  contracts held by usl at the end of each taxable year including for example futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded on a us exchange or board of trade or certain foreign exchanges are treated as if they were sold by usl for their fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year a shareholder’s distributive share of usl’s net gain or loss with respect to each section  contract generally is treated as longterm capital gain or loss to the extent of  percent thereof and as shortterm capital gain or loss to the extent of  percent thereof without regard to the actual holding period “ —  treatment” many of usl’s futures contracts and some of their other commodity interests will qualify as “section  contracts” under the code gain or loss recognized through disposition termination or markingtomarket of usl’s section  contracts will be subject to  —  treatment and allocated to shareholders in accordance with the monthly allocation convention cleared swaps and other commodity swaps will most likely not qualify as section  contracts if a commodity swap is not treated as a section  contract any gain or loss on the swap recognized at the time of disposition or termination will be longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss depending on the holding period of the swap limitations on deductibility of losses and certain expenses a number of different provisions of the code may defer or disallow the deduction of losses or expenses allocated to you by usl including but not limited to those described below a shareholder’s deduction of its allocable share of any loss of usl is limited to the lesser of  the tax basis in its shares or  in the case of a shareholder that is an individual or a closely held corporation the amount which the shareholder is considered to have “at risk” with respect to our activities in general the amount at risk will be your invested capital plus your share of any recourse debt of usl for which you are liable losses in excess of the lesser of tax basis or the amount at risk must be deferred until years in which usl generates additional taxable income against which to offset such carryover losses or until additional capital is placed at risk noncorporate taxpayers are permitted to deduct capital losses only to the extent of their capital gains for the taxable year plus  of other income unused capital losses can be carried forward and used to offset capital gains in future years in addition a noncorporate taxpayer may elect to carry back net losses on section  contracts to each of the three preceding years and use them to offset section  contract gains in those years subject to certain limitations corporate taxpayers generally may deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains subject to special carryback and carryforward rules otherwise deductible expenses incurred by noncorporate taxpayers constituting “miscellaneous itemized deductions” generally including investmentrelated expenses other than interest and certain other specified expenses are deductible only to the extent they exceed  percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for the year although the matter is not free from doubt we believe management fees we pay to uscf and other expenses we incur will constitute investmentrelated expenses subject to the miscellaneous itemized deduction limitation rather than expenses incurred in connection with a trade or business and will report these expenses consistent with that interpretation the code imposes additional limitations on the amount of certain itemized deductions allowable to individuals with adjusted gross income in excess of certain amounts by reducing the otherwise allowable portion of such deductions by an amount equal to the lesser of    •  of the individual’s adjusted gross income in excess of certain threshold amounts or •  of the amount of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year noncorporate shareholders generally may deduct “investment interest expense” only to the extent of their “net investment income” investment interest expense of a shareholder will generally include any interest accrued by usl and any interest paid or accrued on direct borrowings by a shareholder to purchase or carry its shares such as interest with respect to a margin account net investment income generally includes gross income from property held for investment including “portfolio income” under the passive loss rules but not absent an election longterm capital gains or certain qualifying dividend income less deductible expenses other than interest directly connected with the production of investment income to the extent that we allocate losses or expenses to you that must be deferred or disallowed as a result of these or other limitations in the code you may be taxed on income in excess of your economic income or distributions if any on your shares as one example you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income accrued by usl for a particular taxable year and in the same year be allocated a share of a capital loss that you cannot deduct currently because you have insufficient capital gains against which to offset the loss as another example you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income and capital gain for a year but be unable to deduct some or all of your share of management fees andor margin account interest incurred by you with respect to your shares shareholders are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors regarding the effect of limitations under the code on your ability to deduct your allocable share of usl’s losses and expenses tax basis of shares a shareholder’s tax basis in its shares is important in determining  the amount of taxable gain or loss it will realize on the sale or other disposition of its shares  the amount of nontaxable distributions that it may receive from usl and  its ability to utilize its distributive share of any losses of usl on its tax return a shareholder’s initial tax basis of its shares will equal its cost for the shares plus its share of usl’s liabilities if any at the time of purchase in general a shareholder’s “share” of those liabilities will equal the sum of i the entire amount of any otherwise nonrecourse liability of usl as to which the shareholder or an affiliate is the creditor a “partner nonrecourse liability” and ii a pro rata share of any nonrecourse liabilities of usl that are not partner nonrecourse liabilities as to any shareholder a shareholder’s tax basis in its shares generally will be  increased by a its allocable share of usl’s taxable income and gain and b any additional contributions by the shareholder to usl and  decreased but not below zero by a its allocable share of usl’s tax deductions and losses and b any distributions by usl to the shareholder for this purpose an increase in a shareholder’s share of usl’s liabilities will be treated as a contribution of cash by the shareholder to usl and a decrease in that share will be treated as a distribution of cash by usl to the shareholder pursuant to certain irs rulings a shareholder will be required to maintain a single “unified” basis in all shares that it owns as a result when a shareholder that acquired its shares at different prices sells less than all of its shares such shareholder will not be entitled to specify particular shares  eg  those with a higher basis as having been sold rather it must determine its gain or loss on the sale by using an “equitable apportionment” method to allocate a portion of its unified basis in its shares to the shares sold treatment of usl distributions if usl makes nonliquidating distributions to shareholders such distributions generally will not be taxable to the shareholders for federal income tax purposes except to the extent that the sum of i the amount of cash and ii the fair market value of marketable securities distributed exceeds the shareholder’s adjusted basis of its interest in usl immediately before the distribution any cash distributions in excess of a shareholder’s tax basis generally will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of shares constructive termination of the partnership  we will be considered to have been terminated for tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  percent or more of the total interests in our shares within a month period a termination would result in the closing of our taxable year for all shareholders in the case of a shareholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may result in more than  months of our taxable income or loss being includable in its taxable income for the year of termination we would be required to make new tax elections after a termination a termination could result in tax penalties for the shareholders if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred moreover a termination might either accelerate the application of or subject us to any tax legislation enacted before the termination    tax consequences of disposition of shares if a shareholder sells its shares it will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its adjusted tax basis for the shares sold a shareholder’s amount realized will be the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other property received plus its share of any usl debt outstanding gain or loss recognized by a shareholder on the sale or exchange of shares held for more than one year will generally be taxable as longterm capital gain or loss otherwise such gain or loss will generally be taxable as shortterm capital gain or loss a special election is available under the treasury regulations that will allow shareholders to identify and use the actual holding periods for the shares sold for purposes of determining whether the gain or loss recognized on a sale of shares will give rise to longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss it is expected that most shareholders will be eligible to elect and generally will elect to identify and use the actual holding period for shares sold if a shareholder fails to make the election or is not able to identify the holding periods of the shares sold the shareholder may have a split holding period in the shares sold under such circumstances a shareholder will be required to determine its holding period in the shares sold by first determining the portion of its entire interest in usl that would give rise to longterm capital gain or loss if its entire interest were sold and the portion that would give rise to shortterm capital gain or loss if the entire interest were sold the shareholder would then treat each share sold as giving rise to longterm capital gain or loss and shortterm capital gain or loss in the same proportions as if it had sold its entire interest in usl under section  of the code a portion of a shareholder’s gain or loss from the sale of shares regardless of the holding period for such shares will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss to the extent attributable to “unrealized receivables” or “inventory” owned by usl the term “unrealized receivables” includes among other things market discount bonds and shortterm debt instruments to the extent such items would give rise to ordinary income if sold by usl however the short term capital gain on section  contracts resulting from  —  treatment described above should not be subject to this rule if some or all of your shares are lent by your broker or other agent to a third party — for example for use by the third party in covering a short sale — you may be considered as having made a taxable disposition of the loaned shares in which case — • you may recognize taxable gain or loss to the same extent as if you had sold the shares for cash • any of usl’s income gain loss or deduction allocable to those shares during the period of the loan will not be reportable by you for tax purposes and • any distributions you receive with respect to the shares will be fully taxable most likely as ordinary income shareholders desiring to avoid these and other possible consequences of a deemed disposition of their shares should consider modifying any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit the lending of their shares other tax matters information reporting  we report tax information to the beneficial owners of shares the irs has ruled that assignees of partnership interests who have not been admitted to a partnership as partners but who have the capacity to exercise substantial dominion and control over the assigned partnership interests will be considered beneficial owners for federal income tax purposes on the basis of such ruling except as otherwise provided herein we treat the following persons as partners for federal income tax purposes  assignees of shares who are pending admission as limited partners and  shareholders whose shares are held in street name or by another nominee and who have the right to direct the nominee in the exercise of all substantive rights attendant to the ownership of their shares usl will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on irs schedule k form  which will be used by the shareholders in completing their tax returns persons who hold an interest in usl as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us the following information  the name address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee  whether the beneficial owner is a a person that is not a us person b a foreign government an international organization or any whollyowned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing or c a taxexempt entity  the number and a description of shares acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner and  certain information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers means of acquisitions and transfers and acquisition cost for purchases as well as the amount of net proceeds from sales brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish additional information including whether they are us persons and certain information on shares they acquire hold or transfer for their own account a penalty of  per failure up to a maximum of  per calendar year is imposed by the code as amended for failure to report such information correctly to us if the failure to furnish such information correctly is determined to be willful the per failure penalty increases to  or if greater  of the aggregate amount of items required to be reported and the  maximum does not apply the nominee is required to supply the beneficial owner of the shares with the information furnished to us    additional  tax on net investment income  individuals with income in excess of   in the case of married individuals filing jointly and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional  tax on their “net investment income” which generally includes net income from interest dividends annuities royalties and rents and net capital gains other than certain amounts earned from trades or businesses the income subject to the additional  tax includes any income from businesses involved in the trading of financial instruments or commodities partnership audit procedures  the irs may audit the federal income tax returns filed by usl under current law adjustments resulting from any such audit may require each shareholder to adjust a prior year’s tax liability and could result in an audit of the shareholder’s own return any audit of a shareholder’s return could result in adjustments of nonpartnership items as well as usl items partnerships are generally treated as separate entities for purposes of federal tax audits judicial review of administrative adjustments by the irs and tax settlement proceedings the tax treatment of partnership items of income gain loss and deduction are determined at the partnership level in a unified partnership proceeding rather than in separate proceedings with the shareholders the code provides for one shareholder to be designated as the “tax matters partner” and represent the partnership purposes of these proceedings the lp agreement appoints uscf as the tax matters partner of usl in addition for periods beginning after december   usl may be liable for us federal income tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an irs audit the amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction loss or credit to any investor if usl is required to pay any us federal income taxes on any imputed understatement the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of usl and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares under certain circumstances usl may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement including any interest and penalties the ability of a publicly traded partnership such as usl to make this election is uncertain if the election is made usl would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment  “adjusted ks” the investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the adjusted ks are issued the lp agreement will appoint uscf as the partnership representative of usl tax shelter disclosure rules  in certain circumstances the code and treasury regulations require that the irs be notified of taxable transactions through a disclosure statement attached to a taxpayer’s united states federal income tax return these disclosure rules may apply to transactions irrespective of whether they are structured to achieve particular tax benefits they could require disclosure by usl or shareholders if a shareholder incurs a loss in excess a specified threshold from a sale or redemption of its shares or possibly in other circumstances while these rules generally do not require disclosure of a loss recognized on the disposition of an asset in which the taxpayer has a “qualifying basis” generally a basis equal to the amount of cash paid by the taxpayer for such asset they apply to a loss recognized with respect to interests in a passthrough entity such as the shares even if the taxpayer’s basis in such interests is equal to the amount of cash it paid in addition under recently enacted legislation significant penalties may be imposed in connection with a failure to comply with these reporting requirements investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of these reporting requirements to their specific situation taxexempt organizations  subject to numerous exceptions qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts charitable organizations and certain other organizations that otherwise are exempt from federal income tax collectively “exempt organizations” nonetheless are subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income “ubti” generally ubti means the gross income derived by an exempt organization from a trade or business that it regularly carries on the conduct of which is not substantially related to the exercise or performance of its exempt purpose or function less allowable deductions directly connected with that trade or business if usl were to regularly carry on directly or indirectly a trade or business that is unrelated with respect to an exempt organization shareholder then in computing its ubti the shareholder must include its share of  usl’s gross income from the unrelated trade or business whether or not distributed and  usl’s allowable deductions directly connected with that gross income    ubti generally does not include dividends interest or payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale of property other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business nonetheless income on and gain from the disposition of “debtfinanced property” is ubti debtfinanced property generally is incomeproducing property including securities the use of which is not substantially related to the exempt organization’s taxexempt purposes and with respect to which there is “acquisition indebtedness” at any time during the taxable year or if the property was disposed of during the taxable year the month period ending with the disposition acquisition indebtedness includes debt incurred to acquire property debt incurred before the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for the acquisition and debt incurred subsequent to the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for the acquisition and at the time of acquisition the incurrence of debt was foreseeable the portion of the income from debtfinanced property attributable to acquisition indebtedness is equal to the ratio of the average outstanding principal amount of acquisition indebtedness over the average adjusted basis of the property for the year usl currently does not anticipate that it will borrow money to acquire investments however usl cannot be certain that it will not borrow for such purpose in the future in addition an exempt organization shareholder that incurs acquisition indebtedness to purchase its shares in usl may have ubti the federal tax rate applicable to an exempt organization shareholder on its ubti generally will be either the corporate or trust tax rate depending upon the shareholder’s form of organization usl may report to each such shareholder information as to the portion if any of the shareholder’s income and gains from usl for any year that will be treated as ubti the calculation of that amount is complex and there can be no assurance that usl’s calculation of ubti will be accepted by the service an exempt organization shareholder will be required to make payments of estimated federal income tax with respect to its ubti regulated investment companies interests in and income from “qualified publicly traded partnerships” satisfying certain gross income tests are treated as qualifying assets and income respectively for purposes of determining eligibility for regulated investment company “ric” status a ric may invest up to  of its assets in interests in a qualified publicly traded partnership the determination of whether a publicly traded partnership such as usl is a qualified publicly traded partnership is made on an annual basis usl expects to be a qualified publicly traded partnership in each of its taxable years however such qualification is not assured nonus shareholders generally nonus persons who derive us source income or gain from investing or engaging in a us business are taxable on two categories of income the first category consists of amounts that are fixed determinable annual and periodic income such as interest dividends and rent that are not connected with the operation of a us trade or business “fdap” the second category is income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business “eci” fdap income other than interest that is considered “portfolio interest” is generally subject to a  percent withholding tax which may be reduced for certain categories of income by a treaty between the us and the recipient’s country of residence in contrast eci is generally subject to us tax on a net basis at graduated rates upon the filing of a us tax return where a nonus person has eci as a result of an investment in a partnership the eci is subject to a withholding tax at a rate of  percent for individual shareholders and a rate of  for corporate shareholders withholding on allocations and distributions the code provides that a nonus person who is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in a us trade or business during a taxable year will also be considered to be engaged in a us trade or business during that year classifying an activity by a partnership as an investment or an operating business is a factual determination under certain safe harbors in the code an investment fund whose activities consist of trading in stocks securities or commodities for its own account generally will not be considered to be engaged in a us trade or business unless it is a dealer is such stocks securities or commodities this safe harbor applies to investments in commodities only if the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange and if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place although the matter is not free from doubt usl believes that the activities directly conducted by usl will not result in usl being engaged in a trade or business within in the united states however there can be no assurance that the irs would not successfully assert that usl’s activities constitute a us trade or business in the event that usl’s activities were considered to constitute a us trade or business usl would be required to withhold at the highest rate specified in code section  currently  on allocations of our income to individual nonus shareholders and the highest rate specified in code section b currently  on allocations of our income to corporate nonus shareholders when such income is allocated or distributed a nonus shareholder with eci will generally be required to file a us federal income tax return and the return will provide the nonus shareholder with the mechanism to seek a refund of any withholding in excess of such shareholder’s actual us federal income tax liability any amount withheld by usl on behalf of a nonus shareholder will be treated as a distribution to the nonus shareholder to the extent possible in some cases usl may not be able to match the economic cost of satisfying its withholding obligations to a particular nonus shareholder which may result in such cost being borne by usl generally and accordingly by all shareholders if usl is not treated as engaged in a us trade or business a nonus shareholder may nevertheless be treated as having fdap income which would be subject to a  percent withholding tax possibly subject to reduction by treaty with respect to some or all of its distributions from usl or its allocable share of usl income amounts withheld on behalf of a nonus shareholder will be treated as being distributed to such shareholder    to the extent any interest income allocated to a nonus shareholder that otherwise constitutes fdap is considered “portfolio interest” neither the allocation of such interest income to the nonus shareholder nor a subsequent distribution of such interest income to the nonus shareholder will be subject to withholding provided that the nonus shareholder is not otherwise engaged in a trade or business in the us and provides usl with a timely and properly completed and executed irs form wben wbene or other applicable form in general “portfolio interest” is interest paid on debt obligations issued in registered form unless the “recipient” owns  percent or more of the voting power of the issuer most of usl’s interest income qualifies as “portfolio interest” in order for usl to avoid withholding on any interest income allocable to nonus shareholders that would qualify as “portfolio interest” it will be necessary for all nonus shareholders to provide usl with a timely and properly completed and executed form wben or other applicable form if a nonus shareholder fails to provide a properly completed form wben wbene or other applicable form uscf may request that the nonus shareholder provide within  days after the request by uscf a properly completed form wben wbene or other applicable form if a nonus shareholder fails to comply with this request the shares owned by such nonus shareholder will be subject to redemption gain from sale of shares  gain from the sale or exchange of the shares may be taxable to a nonus shareholder if the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the us for  days or more during the taxable year in such case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a  percent withholding tax on the amount of such individual’s gain branch profits tax on corporate nonus shareholders in addition to the taxes noted above any nonus shareholders that are corporations may also be subject to an additional tax the branch profits tax at a rate of  percent the branch profits tax is imposed on a nonus corporation’s dividend equivalent amount which generally consists of the corporation’s aftertax earnings and profits that are effectively connected with the corporation’s us trade or business but are not reinvested in a us business this tax may be reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty between the united states and the country in which the nonus shareholder is a “qualified resident” prospective nonus shareholders should consult their tax advisor with regard to these and other issues unique to nonus shareholders backup withholding usl may be required to withhold us federal income tax “backup withholding” at a rate of  from all payments to  any shareholder who fails to furnish usl with his her or its correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that the shareholder is exempt from backup withholding and  any shareholder with respect to whom the irs notifies usl that the shareholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the irs and to respond to notices to that effect backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be returned or credited against a taxpayer’s regular federal income tax liability if appropriate information is provided to the irs foreign account tax compliance act provisions legislation commonly referred to as the “foreign account tax compliance act” or “fatca” generally imposes a  withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions “ffis” unless such ffis i enter into an agreement with the us treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts held by us persons or held by foreign entities that have us persons as substantial owners or ii reside in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement “iga” with the united states to collect and share such information and comply with the terms of such iga and any enabling legislation or regulations the types of income subject to the tax include ussource interest and dividends and after december   the gross proceeds from the sale of any property that could produce ussource interest or dividends the information required to be reported includes the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a us person and transaction activity within the holder’s account in addition subject to certain exceptions this legislation also imposes a  withholding on payments to foreign entities that are not financial institutions unless the foreign entity certifies that it does not have a greater than  us owner or provides the withholding agent with identifying information on each greater than  us owner depending on the status of a nonus shareholder and the status of the intermediaries through which they hold their shares nonus shareholders could be subject to this  withholding tax with respect to distributions on their shares and proceeds from the sale of their shares under certain circumstances a nonus shareholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes    other tax considerations in addition to federal income taxes shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as state and local income taxes unincorporated business taxes business franchise taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which usl does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in usl it is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate us federal state local and foreign tax returns eversheds sutherland us llp has not provided an opinion concerning any aspects of state local or foreign tax or us federal tax other than those us federal income tax issues discussed herein investment by erisa accounts general most employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts “iras” are subject to the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” or the code or both this section discusses certain considerations that arise under erisa and the code that a fiduciary of i an employee benefit plan as defined in erisa ii a plan as defined in section  of the code or iii any collective investment vehicle business trust investment partnership pooled separate account or other entity the assets of which are treated as comprised at least in part of “plan assets” under the erisa plan asset rules “plan asset entity” who has investment discretion should take into account before deciding to invest the plan’s assets in usl employee benefit plans plans and plan asset entities are collectively referred to below as plans and fiduciaries with investment discretion are referred to below as plan fiduciaries this summary is based on the provisions of erisa and the code as of the date hereof this summary is not intended to be complete but only to address certain questions under erisa and the code likely to be raised by your advisors the summary does not include state or local law potential plan investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the appropriateness of an investment in usl and the manner in which shares should be purchased special investment considerations each plan fiduciary must consider the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in usl including the role that an investment in usl would play in the plan’s overall investment portfolio each plan fiduciary before deciding to invest in usl must be satisfied that the investment is prudent for the plan that the investments of the plan are diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses and that an investment in usl complies with the terms of the plan usl and plan assets a regulation issued under erisa contains rules for determining when an investment by a plan in an equity interest of a limited partnership will result in the underlying assets of the partnership being deemed plan assets for purposes of erisa and section  of the code those rules provide that assets of a limited partnership will not be plan assets of a plan that purchases an equity interest in the partnership if the equity interest purchased is a publiclyoffered security if the underlying assets of a partnership are considered to be assets of any plan for purposes of erisa or section  of the code the operations of that partnership would be subject to and in some cases limited by the provisions of erisa and section  of the code the publiclyoffered security exception described above applies if the equity interest is a security that is  freely transferable determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances  part of a class of securities that is widely held meaning that the class of securities is owned by  or more investors independent of the issuer and of each other and  either a part of a class of securities registered under section b or g of the exchange act or b sold to the plan as part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act of  and the class of which such security is a part is registered under the exchange act within  days or such later time as may be allowed by the sec after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer in which the offering of such security occurred    the plan asset regulations under erisa state that the determination of whether a security is freely transferable is to be made based on all the relevant facts and circumstances in the case of a security that is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is  or less the following requirements alone or in combination ordinarily will not affect a finding that the security is freely transferable  a requirement that no transfer or assignment of the security or rights relating to the security be made that would violate any federal or state law  a requirement that no transfer or assignment be made without advance written notice given to the entity that issued the security and  any restriction on the substitution of an assignee as a limited partner of a partnership including a general partner consent requirement provided that the economic benefits of ownership of the assignor may be transferred or assigned without regard to such restriction or consent other than compliance with any of the foregoing restrictions uscf believes that the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to the shares uscf believes that the shares therefore constitute publiclyoffered securities and the underlying assets of usl are not considered to constitute plan assets of any plan that purchases shares prohibited transactions erisa and the code generally prohibit certain transactions involving the plan and persons who have certain specified relationships to the plan in general shares may not be purchased with the assets of a plan if uscf the clearing brokers the trading advisors if any or any of their affiliates agents or employees either • exercise any discretionary authority or discretionary control with respect to management of the plan • exercise any authority or control with respect to management or disposition of the assets of the plan • render investment advice for a fee or other compensation direct or indirect with respect to any monies or other property of the plan • have any authority or responsibility to render investment advice with respect to any monies or other property of the plan or • have any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan also a prohibited transaction may occur under erisa or the code when circumstances indicate that  the investment in a share is made or retained for the purpose of avoiding application of the fiduciary standards of erisa  the investment in a share constitutes an arrangement under which usl is expected to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited if entered into directly by the plan purchasing the share  the investing plan by itself has the authority or influence to cause usl to engage in such transactions or  a person who is prohibited from transacting with the investing plan may but only with the aid of certain of its affiliates and the investing plan cause usl to engage in such transactions with such person special ira rules iras are not subject to erisa’s fiduciary standards but are subject to their own rules including the prohibited transaction rules of section  of the code which generally mirror erisa’s prohibited transaction rules for example iras are subject to special custody rules and must maintain a qualifying ira custodial arrangement separate and distinct from usl and its custodial arrangement otherwise if a separate qualifying custodial arrangement is not maintained an investment in the shares will be treated as a distribution from the ira second iras are prohibited from investing in certain commingled investments and uscf makes no representation regarding whether an investment in shares is an inappropriate commingled investment for an ira third in applying the prohibited transaction provisions of section  of the code in addition to the rules summarized above the individual for whose benefit the ira is maintained is also treated as the creator of the ira for example if the owner or beneficiary of an ira enters into any transaction arrangement or agreement involving the assets of his or her ira to benefit the ira owner or beneficiary or his or her relatives or business affiliates personally or with the understanding that such benefit will occur directly or indirectly such transaction could give rise to a prohibited transaction that is not exempted by any available exemption moreover in the case of an ira the consequences of a nonexempt prohibited transaction are that the ira’s assets will be treated as if they were distributed causing immediate taxation of the assets including any early distribution penalty tax applicable under section  of the code in addition to any other fines or penalties that may apply exempt plans certain employee benefit plans may be governmental plans or church plans governmental plans and church plans are generally not subject to erisa nor do the abovedescribed prohibited transaction provisions described above apply to them these plans are however subject to prohibitions against certain relatedparty transactions under section  of the code which operate similar to the prohibited transaction rules described above in addition the fiduciary of any governmental or church plan must consider any applicable state or local laws and any restrictions and duties of common law imposed upon the plan    no view is expressed as to whether an investment in usl and any continued investment in usl or the operation and administration of usl is appropriate or permissible for any governmental plan or church plan under code section  or under any state county local or other law relating to that type of plan allowing an investment in usl is not to be construed as a representation by usl uscf any trading advisor any clearing broker the marketing agent or legal counsel or other advisors to such parties or any other party that this investment meets some or all of the relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any particular plan or that this investment is appropriate for any such particular plan the person with investment discretion should consult with the plan’s attorney and financial advisors as to the propriety of an investment in usl in light of the circumstances of the particular plan current tax law and erisa form of shares registered form shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the lp agreement the administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form the administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry the “register” uscf recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the lp agreement the beneficial interests in such shares are held in bookentry form through participants andor accountholders in dtc book entry  individual certificates are not issued for the shares instead shares are represented by one or more global certificates which are deposited by the administrator with dtc and registered in the name of cede  co as nominee for dtc the global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time shareholders are limited to  participants in dtc such as banks brokers dealers and trust companies “dtc participants”  those who maintain either directly or indirectly a custodial relationship with a dtc participant “indirect participants” and  those banks brokers dealers trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through dtc participants or indirect participants in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares dtc participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants’ accounts in dtc will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for dtc’s sameday funds settlement system shares are credited to dtc participants’ securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment dtc dtc has advised us as follows it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the state of new york and is a member of the federal reserve system a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of section a of the exchange act dtc holds securities for dtc participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between dtc participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of dtc participants transfer of shares transfers of shares only through dtc the shares are only transferable through the bookentry system of dtc limited partners who are not dtc participants may transfer their shares through dtc by instructing the dtc participant holding their shares or by instructing the indirect participant or other entity through which their shares are held to transfer the shares transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice transfers of interests in shares with dtc are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of dtc and the nature of the transfer dtc has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants andor accountholders of dtc because dtc can only act on behalf of dtc participants who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants the ability of a person or entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in dtc or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be affected by the lack of a certificate or other definitive document representing such interest dtc has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a shareholder including without limitation the presentation of a global certificate for exchange only at the direction of one or more dtc participants in whose account with dtc interests in global certificates are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate as to which such dtc participant or participants has or have given such direction    transferapplication requirements  all purchasers of usl’s shares and potentially any purchasers of shares in the future who wish to become limited partners or other record holders and receive cash distributions if any or have certain other rights must deliver an executed transfer application in which the purchaser or transferee must certify that among other things he she or it agrees to be bound by usl’s lp agreement and is eligible to purchase usl’s securities each purchaser of shares offered by this prospectus must execute a transfer application and certification the obligation to provide the form of transfer application will be imposed on the seller of shares or if a purchase of shares is made through an exchange the form may be obtained directly through usl further uscf may request each record holder to furnish certain information including that record holder’s nationality citizenship or other related status a record holder is a shareholder that is or has applied to be a limited partner an investor who is not a us resident may not be eligible to become a record holder or one of usl’s limited partners if that investor’s ownership would subject usl to the risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of usl’s assets under any federal state or local law or regulation if the record holder fails to furnish the information or if uscf determines on the basis of the information furnished by the holder in response to the request that such holder is not qualified to become one of usl’s limited partners uscf may be substituted as a holder for the record holder who will then be treated as a noncitizen assignee and usl will have the right to redeem those securities held by the record holder a transferee’s broker agent or nominee may complete execute and deliver a transfer application and certification usl may at its discretion treat the nominee holder of a share as the absolute owner in that case the beneficial holder’s rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the nominee holder a person purchasing usl’s existing shares who does not execute a transfer application and certify that the purchaser is eligible to purchase those securities acquires no rights in those securities other than the right to resell those securities whether or not a transfer application is received or the consent of uscf obtained our shares are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing transfers of securities any transfer of shares will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by uscf unless a completed transfer application is delivered to uscf or the administrator when acquiring shares the transferee of such shares that completes a transfer application will • be an assignee until admitted as a substituted limited partner upon the consent and sole discretion of uscf and the recording of the assignment on the books and records of the partnership • automatically request admission as a substituted limited partner • agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of and execute our lp agreement • represent that such transferee has the capacity and authority to enter into our lp agreement • grant powers of attorney to uscf and any liquidator of us and • make the consents and waivers contained in our lp agreement an assignee will become a limited partner in respect of the transferred shares upon the consent of uscf and the recordation of the name of the assignee on our books and records such consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of uscf if consent of uscf is withheld such transferee shall be an assignee an assignee shall have an interest in the partnership equivalent to that of a limited partner with respect to allocations and distributions including without limitation liquidating distributions of the partnership with respect to voting rights attributable to shares that are held by assignees uscf shall be deemed to be the limited partner with respect thereto and shall in exercising the voting rights in respect of such shares on any matter vote such shares at the written direction of the assignee who is the record holder of such shares if no such written direction is received such shares will not be voted an assignee shall have no other rights of a limited partner until a share has been transferred on our books we and the transfer agent may treat the record holder of the share as the absolute owner for all purposes except as otherwise required by law or stock exchange regulations    what is the plan of distribution buying and selling shares most investors buy and sell shares of usl in secondary market transactions through brokers shares trade on the nyse arca under the ticker symbol “usl” shares are bought and sold throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities when buying or selling shares through a broker most investors incur customary brokerage commissions and charges investors are encouraged to review the terms of their brokerage account for details on applicable charges marketing agent and authorized participants the offering of usl’s shares is a best efforts offering usl continuously offers creation baskets consisting of  shares through the marketing agent to authorized participants authorized participants pay a  fee for each order they place to create or redeem one or more creation baskets the marketing agent receives for its services as marketing agent to usl a marketing fee of  on usl’s assets up to the first  billion and  on usl’s assets in excess of  billion provided however that in no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the marketing agent and any affiliate of the general partner for distributionrelated services in connection with this offering exceed ten percent  of the gross proceeds of this offering the offering of baskets is being made in compliance with conduct rule  of finra accordingly authorized participants will not make any sales to any account over which they have discretionary authority without the prior written approval of a purchaser of shares the per share price of shares offered in creation baskets on any subsequent day will be the total nav of usl calculated shortly after the close of the core trading session on the nyse arca on that day divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares an authorized participant is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares by executing an authorized participant agreement an authorized participant becomes part of the group of parties eligible to purchase baskets from and put baskets for redemption to usl an authorized participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets and an authorized participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create as of february   usl had the following authorized participants citadel securities llc citigroup global markets inc jp morgan securities inc merrill lynch professional clearing corp morgan stanley  company inc nomura securities international inc rbc capital markets llc sg americas securities llc and virtu financial bd llc because new shares can be created and issued on an ongoing basis at any point during the life of usl a “distribution” as such term is used in the  act will be occurring authorized participants other brokerdealers and other persons are cautioned that some of their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectusdelivery and liability provisions of the  act for example the initial authorized participant was a statutory underwriter with respect to its initial purchase of creation baskets in addition any purchaser who purchases shares with a view towards distribution of such shares may be deemed to be a statutory underwriter authorized participants will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements in connection with the sale of shares to customers for example an authorized participant other brokerdealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases a basket from usl breaks the basket down into the constituent shares and sells the shares to its customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the shares authorized participants may also engage in secondary market transactions in shares that would not be deemed “underwriting” for example an authorized participant may act in the capacity of a broker or dealer with respect to shares that were previously distributed by other authorized participants a determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the brokerdealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that would lead to designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectusdelivery and liability provisions of the  act dealers who are neither authorized participants nor “underwriters” but are nonetheless participating in a distribution as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of section c of the  act would be unable to take advantage of the prospectusdelivery exemption provided by section  of the  act uscf may qualify the shares in states selected by uscf and intends that sales be made through brokerdealers who are members of finra investors intending to create or redeem baskets through authorized participants in transactions not involving a brokerdealer registered in such investor’s state of domicile or residence should consult their legal advisor regarding applicable brokerdealer or securities regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or redemption    while the authorized participants may be indemnified by uscf they will not be entitled to receive a discount or commission from usl for their purchases of creation baskets calculating per share nav usl’s per share nav is calculated by • taking the current market value of its total assets • subtracting any liabilities and • dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares the administrator calculates the per share nav of usl once each nyse arca trading day the per share nav for a normal trading day is released after  pm new york time trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at  pm new york time the administrator uses the nymex closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the nymex or  pm new york time for the oil futures contracts traded on the nymex but calculates or determines the value of all other usl investments including oil futures contracts not traded on the nymex other oilrelated investments and treasuries using market quotations if available or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or  pm new york time in accordance with the current administrative agency agreement among bbhco usl and uscf “other information” customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including without limitation relevant rates prices yields yield curves volatilities spreads correlations or other market data in the relevant market or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by usl in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions the information may include costs of funding to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized third parties supplying quotations or market data may include without limitation dealers in the relevant markets endusers of the relevant product information vendors brokers and other sources of market information in addition in order to provide updated information relating to usl for use by investors and market professionals the nyse arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value the indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day’s closing per share nav of usl as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the active light sweet oil futures contracts on the nymex the prices reported for those oil futures contract months are adjusted based on the prior day’s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract in the event that the spot month contract is also the benchmark oil futures contract the last sale price for the benchmark oil futures contract is not adjusted the indicative fund value share basis disseminated during nyse arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share nav because the per share nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of usl’s investments the indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every  seconds during regular nyse arca core trading session hours of  am new york time to  pm new york time the normal trading hours of the nymex are  am new york time to  pm new york time this means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which usl’s shares are traded on the nyse arca but realtime nymex trading prices for oil futures contracts traded on the nymex are not available during such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such oil futures contracts from the nymex’s immediately preceding trading session in addition other oil futures contracts other oilrelated investments and treasuries held by usl will be valued by the administrator using rates and points received from clientapproved third party vendors such as reuters and wm company and advisor quotes these investments will not be included in the indicative fund value the nyse arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of ctacq high speed lines in addition the indicative fund value is published on the nyse arca’s website and is available through online information services such as bloomberg and reuters    dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of usl shares on the nyse arca investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of usl and the indicative fund value if the market price of usl shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades for example if usl appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value a market professional could buy usl shares on the nyse arca and sell short oil futures contracts such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of usl and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants creation and redemption of shares usl creates and redeems shares from time to time but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets the creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to usl or the distribution by usl of the amount of treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed the amount of which is based on the combined nav of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of  pm new york time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received authorized participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets authorized participants must be  registered brokerdealers or other securities market participants such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as brokerdealers to engage in securities transactions as described below and  dtc participants to become an authorized participant a person must enter into an authorized participant agreement with uscf on behalf of usl each such agreement an “authorized participant agreement” the authorized participant agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions the authorized participant agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by uscf without the consent of any shareholder or authorized participant authorized participants pay a transaction fee of  to usl for each order they place to create one or more creation baskets or to redeem one or more redemption baskets the transaction fee may be reduced increased or otherwise changed by uscf authorized participants who make deposits with usl in exchange for baskets receive no fees commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either usl or uscf and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to uscf or usl to effect any sale or resale of shares certain authorized participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical crude oil market and the crude oil futures market in some cases authorized participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell crude oil or oil interests and may profit in these instances uscf believes that the size and operation of the crude oil market make it unlikely that an authorized participant’s direct activities in the crude oil or securities markets will significantly affect the price of crude oil oil interests or the price of the shares each authorized participant is required

liabilities under the  act and to contribute to the payments the authorized participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities the following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the lp agreement and the form of authorized participant agreement for more detail each of which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus creation procedures on any business day an authorized participant may place an order with the marketing agent to create one or more baskets for purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders a “business day” means any day other than a day when any of the nyse arca the nymex or the new york stock exchange is closed for regular trading purchase orders must be placed by  pm new york time or the close of regular trading on the nyse arca whichever is earlier the day on which the marketing agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date by placing a purchase order an authorized participant agrees to deposit treasuries cash or a combination of treasuries and cash as described below prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order the authorized participant must also have wired to the custodian the nonrefundable transaction fee due for the purchase order authorized participants may not withdraw a creation request except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the authorized participant agreement    the manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the authorized participant agreement by placing a purchase order an authorized participant agrees to  deposit treasuries cash or a combination of treasuries and cash with the custodian of the fund and  if required by uscf in its sole discretion enter into or arrange for a block trade an exchange for physical or exchange for swap or any other otc energy transaction through itself or a designated

fails to consummate  and  the order shall be cancelled the number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by uscf in its sole discretion to meet usl’s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the authorized participant’s purchase of shares determination of required deposits the total deposit required to create each basket “creation basket deposit” is the amount of treasuries andor cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of usl net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees expenses and other liabilities on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates uscf determines directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the administrator the requirements for treasuries and the amount of cash including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a treasury and proportions of treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets the marketing agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day the amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate

delivery of required deposits an authorized participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to usl’s account with the custodian the required amount of treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date upon receipt of the deposit amount the administrator directs dtc to credit the number of baskets ordered to the authorized participant’s dtc account on the third business day following the purchase order date the expense and risk of delivery and ownership of treasuries until such treasuries have been received by the custodian on behalf of usl shall be borne solely by the authorized participant because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by  pm new york time but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after  pm new york time on the date the purchase order is received authorized participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket usl’s nav and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined rejection of purchase orders uscf acting by itself or through the marketing agent shall have the absolute right but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a creation basket deposit if • it determines that the investment alternative available to usl at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective • it determines that the purchase order or the creation basket deposit is not in proper form • it believes that the purchase order or the creation basket deposit would have adverse tax consequences to usl the limited partners or its shareholders • the acceptance or receipt of the creation basket deposit would in the opinion of counsel to uscf be unlawful or • circumstances outside the control of uscf marketing agent or custodian make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process creations of baskets none of uscf marketing agent or custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or creation basket deposit    redemption procedures the procedures by which an authorized participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets on any business day an authorized participant may place an order with the marketing agent to redeem one or more baskets redemption orders must be placed by  pm new york time or the close of regular trading on the nyse arca whichever is earlier a redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the marketing agent “redemption order date” the redemption procedures allow authorized participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a redemption basket or to redeem baskets other than through an authorized participant by placing a redemption order an authorized participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through dtc’s bookentry system to usl as described below prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order the authorized participant must also have wired to usl’s account at the custodian the nonrefundable transaction fee due for the redemption order an authorized participant may not withdraw a redemption order except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the authorized participant agreement the manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the authorized participant agreement by placing a redemption order an authorized participant agrees to  deliver the redemption basket to be redeemed through dtc’s bookentry system to the fund’s account with the custodian not later than  pm new york time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order “redemption distribution date” and  if required by uscf in its sole discretion enter into or arrange for a block trade an exchange for physical or exchange for swap or any other otc energy transaction through itself or a designated acceptable broker with the fund for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the redemption order date if an authorized participant fails to consummate  and  above the order shall be cancelled the number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by uscf in its sole discretion to meet usl’s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the authorized participant’s sale of shares determination of redemption distribution the redemption distribution from usl consists of a transfer to the redeeming authorized participant of an amount of treasuries andor cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of usl net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees expenses and other liabilities on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received uscf directly or in consultation with the administrator determines the requirements for treasuries and the amounts of cash including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a treasury and the proportions of treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets the marketing agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day delivery of redemption distribution the redemption distribution due from usl will be delivered to the authorized participant by  pm new york time on the third business day following the redemption order date if by  pm new york time on such third business day usl’s dtc account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed if usl’s dtc account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if usl receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which uscf may from time to time determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to usl’s dtc account by  pm new york time on such next business day any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled pursuant to information from uscf the custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to usl’s dtc account by  pm new york time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the authorized participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through dtc’s book entrysystem on such terms as uscf may from time to time determine suspension or rejection of redemption orders uscf may in its discretion suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption settlement date  for any period during which the nyse arca or the nymex is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings or trading on the nyse arca or the nymex is suspended or restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery disposal or evaluation of treasuries is not reasonably practicable or  for such other period as uscf determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or shareholders for example uscf may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of usl’s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption if uscf has difficulty liquidating its positions eg  because of a market disruption event in the futures markets a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified none of uscf the marketing agent the administrator or the custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement    redemption orders must be made in whole baskets uscf will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the authorized participant agreement or if the fulfillment of the order in the opinion of its counsel might be unlawful uscf may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to  shares  ie  two baskets or less creation and redemption transaction fee to compensate usl for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets an authorized participant is required to pay a transaction fee to usl of  per order to create or redeem baskets uscf shall notify dtc of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until  days after the date of the notice tax responsibility authorized participants are responsible for any transfer tax sales or use tax stamp tax recording tax value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the authorized participant and agree to indemnify uscf and usl if they are required by law to pay any such tax together with any applicable penalties additions to tax and interest thereon secondary market transactions as noted usl creates and redeems shares from time to time but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets the creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to usl or the distribution by usl of the amount of treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed the amount of which will be based on the aggregate nav of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received as discussed above authorized participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets authorized participants must be registered brokerdealers or other securities market participants such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as brokerdealers to engage in securities transactions an authorized participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets and an authorized participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create authorized participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at pershare offering prices that are expected to reflect among other factors the trading price of the shares on the nyse arca the nav of usl at the time the authorized participant purchased the creation baskets and the nav of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale and the liquidity of the oil futures contract market and the market for other oilrelated investments the prices of shares offered by authorized participants are expected to fall between usl’s nav and the trading price of the shares on the nyse arca at the time of sale shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by authorized participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices an order for one or more baskets may be placed by an authorized participant on behalf of multiple clients authorized participants who make deposits with usl in exchange for baskets receive no fees commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either usl or uscf and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to uscf or usl to effect any sale or resale of shares shares trade in the secondary market on the nyse arca shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their nav per share the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav per share may be influenced by various factors including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the oil futures contracts market and the market for other oilrelated investments while the shares trade during the core trading session on the nyse arca until  pm new york time liquidity in the market for oil interests may be reduced after the close of the nymex at  pm new york time as a result during this time trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen    use of proceeds uscf causes usl to transfer the proceeds from the sale of creation baskets to the custodian or other custodian for trading activities uscf will invest usl’s assets in oil interests and investments in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents when usl purchases an oil futures contract and certain exchangetraded other oilrelated investments usl is required to deposit typically  to  with the selling fcm on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under oil interests at maturity this deposit is known as initial margin counterparties in transactions in otc contracts will generally impose similar collateral requirements on usl uscf will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in treasuries cash andor cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements uscf has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are • held on deposit with the fcm or other custodian • used for other investments and • held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves approximately  to  of usl’s assets have normally been committed as margin for commodity futures contracts however from time to time the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more or less than such range ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchangetraded and otc contracts based on changes in the value of the oil interests furthermore ongoing collateral requirements with respect to otc contracts are negotiated by the parties and may be affected by overall market volatility volatility of the underlying commodity or index the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the oil interest and each party’s creditworthiness in light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchangetraded and otc contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments it is not possible to estimate what portion of usl’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time the treasuries cash and cash equivalents held by usl will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements all interest income will be used for usl’s benefit an fcm counterparty government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to usl to hold trading positions at any time moreover margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held the assets of usl posted as margin for oil futures contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the cea and cftc regulations if usl enters into a swap agreement usl must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterpartyies the amount of collateral usl posts changes according to the amounts owed by usl to its counterparty on a given swap transaction while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by usl at the start of a swap transaction collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian information you should know this prospectus contains information you should
