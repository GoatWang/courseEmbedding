research  we are bottom up stock pickers with the decision makers as close as possible to the flow of information  communicating directly with company management analysts and other sources  we believe that our direct company research is the driving force behind our investment results  historically relative outperformance has been achieved through security selection not sector allocation summit creek advisors believes that investing in high quality companies with consistent and sustainable growth provides the best opportunity for achieving superior portfolio returns over the longterm  we initially search for companies with a proven growth track record low financial leverage  high return on equity strong cash flow and significant management ownership  through detailed internal research we identify companies with consistent growth characteristics that appear to be sustainable for a multiyear period  valuation is also a very important part of our process in determining when to purchase new ideas and how to weight holdings in the portfolio  over time this focus on high quality companies and valuation has resulted in strong downside protection we continue to perform ongoing rigorous research once a stock is in the portfolio  this includes constructing an earnings model on each company to enhance our understanding of the business and sensitivity of company earnings to changing growth or margin assumptions  in addition frequent discussions with company management teams analysts and other sources are of critical importance to effectively value the securities in our portfolio while also helping us to assess continued fit and sustainable growth the result of our investment process is a concentrated small cap growth portfolio  the focus on consistent and sustainable growth has historically resulted in a portfolio heavily weighted in the traditional growth sectors of consumer health care and technology  our longterm performance has been driven by bottomup security selection a focus on valuation and the ability to assess a companys sustainable growth fit     website builder provided by vistaprint ﻿ summit creek advisors llc  legal legal
