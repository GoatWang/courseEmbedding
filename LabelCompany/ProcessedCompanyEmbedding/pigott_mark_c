company also provided customer support and aftermarket parts for its products paccars other products included braden carco and gearmatic industrial winches except for a few companyowned branches paccars trucks and parts were sold exclusively through independent dealerships the companys paclease and paccar financial corporation subsidiaries sold paccar products in many countries worldwide along with truck leasing and financing services in the early s paccar employed about  people in  factories nine distribution centers and various regional offices around the world four generations of paccar leaders in  william pigott sr – the son of irish immigrants and greatgrandfather of mark pigott founded the seattle car manufacturing company—as paccar was originally known—in west seattle washington where it made logging equipment and trucks the company was incorporated on february   it merged with a portland oregon company twohy brothers in  and was renamed the pacific car and foundry company where it expanded into making rail cars the company was sold to american car and foundry in  and went through several difficult periods during the great depression as demand decreased for rail cars the pigott family did not have control of the company from the late s to the early s paul pigott – william pigotts son and marks grandfather reacquired the company in  and ran it as chairman and ceo until his death in  the company manufactured sherman tanks for use during world war ii at the wars end however in  the company migrated its business into truck manufacturing when it acquired the kenworth motor truck company in seattle washington and later the peterbilt truck company based in california charles m pigott – paul pigotts son and marks father became president in  and added the titles of chairman and ceo three years later on january   pacific car and foundry company changed its name to paccar to better describe the businesses it owned and operated charless son mark pigott the companys chairman and ceo in the early st century succeeded him in  career with paccar pigott worked at the company during the summers while he was in high school during summer breaks from stanford university pigott was employed at paccar dealerships those early experiences which included welding painting trucks operating forklifts and assembling chassis main frames of trucks helped pigott learn almost all aspects of the business after college he was hired in  as an internal auditor pigott advanced in several positions at a number of divisions including peterbilt motors headquartered in denton texas and foden trucks in the united kingdom pigott was hired as vice president of paccar in october  and was promoted in january  to the position of senior vice president in december  he was selected to be paccars executive vice president pigott became a director beginning in  and was promoted to vice chairman in january  pigott became ceo and chairman in january  pigott was a lowkey leader avoiding interviews and the highprofile lifestyles often led by his corporate peers in fact pigott was opposed to the publicityseeking headlines that were all too often prominent in corporate management on the other hand he was very lively and informative when speaking with pride for example about his aerodynamic truck bodies and various custommade accessories inside the cabs an enthusiastic detailoriented leader pigott gained a reputation as one of the most respected world authorities in the trucking industry people who knew the tall lanky pigott frequently commented about how dedicated he was to the company and its people no doubt part of that passion for paccar came from the long family heritage of building vehicles to transport freight paccar in the s during the s pigott continued the consistent customeroriented philosophy that had been adopted by his predecessors within the company pigott also maintained a strong leadership style for paccar consequently paccar was not as negatively affected as other large companies during periodic operational and economic upheavals in the industry pigott spent much of his time in the s supporting new technologies within paccar he was proud of the fact that paccar was one of the few truck manufacturers that incorporated technology in its designing manufacturing and marketing processes for example pigott introduced computer technology when bringing parts into paccar factories this justintime process a set of computer techniques to improve the return on investment by reducing inhouse inventories and their related costs dramatically reduced the amount of storage space needed for paccar area that was eventually turned into additional manufacturing surfaces application of this and other innovative technologies meant that paccar was able to develop new truck lines in months not years like other companies in fact the company was recognized by pc week magazine in  for the quality of its information technology systems according to pigott such investments in technology gave paccar a threetofiveyear lead over its competition with respect to overall ability to design manufacture and market products serve customers and manage finances with very little debt to restrict its operations pigott was able to invest more money in the business for quicker production of its goods such actions yielded greater profits higher market share and better name recognition all of which resulted in paccars winning quality awards from around the world stock analysts who regularly followed paccar agreed that pigotts focus on operational excellence would continue to increase the companys share of this key manufacturing market in  paccars parts division opened a new headquarters building in renton washington the building occupied part of the companys historic pacific car and foundry site the s were also an important growth period for paccar financial corporation which offered inhouse financing for kenworth and peterbilt and for paccars leasing corporation which became one of the  largest fullservice leasing companies in north america by  paccar marketed trucks in more than  countries and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in north america by the end of the s pigott had overseen the inception of several capital projects including a  squarefoot research and development center at its kenworth truck plant in renton an expansion project that nearly doubled the size of its customer call center also in renton and new parts distribution centers in atlanta georgia and leyland england during the late s pigott focused on communication and management systems for its truck dealers and owner operators pigott had paccars dealer management consulting arm offer services for human resources insurance and financial planning dealership operations and management and computer systems management pigott directed paccars driver board and dealer councils to let kenworth and peterbilt drivers and dealers share customer feedback with the paccar management team as a result of pigotts innovations especially with new computer technologies improved design features and greater product quality were incorporated into all of the companys products driving success net income in the first quarter of  at paccar rose  percent to  million compared with  million just one year earlier at the same time revenue rose  percent to  billion from  billion pigott announced that all of paccars segments had strong results with  being the companys secondbest year in its history pigott also participated in various activities outside of paccar he was a member of the washington state roundtable the business council in washington dc the world economic forum in davos switzerland and the society of american engineers and he was active in numerous local charitable organizations in the pacific northwest a tradition of excellence the four generations of pigott men who led paccar achieved quality results for decades earning a net profit and paying a dividend every year since  with pigotts technological innovations and attention to customer services paccar continued to show consistent profits even though the trade and transportation industry went through a dramatic downturn at the beginning of the s mark pigott along with his forebears pursued nearly a century of quality that led to paccars being a strong business leader in the northwestern united states and a major global corporation pigott credited the creative contributions of paccars employees and coordinated efforts by management to expand market share overseas and to invest in facilities new products and information technology for the companys outstanding performance in the s and early s paccar was well positioned in the early st century to extend its string of profitable years see also entry on paccar inc in international directory of company histories  sources for further information becker paula

manufacturing executive mark c pigott was the ceo and chairman of the bellevue washingtonbased paccar as the leader of this diversified multinational company pigott was responsible for maintaining the consistently high standards of quality that paccar had historically guaranteed in all of its products pigott ensured that his lines of wellengineered highly customized and exceptionally performing products were sold efficiently throughout its global markets in fact in  pigott was awarded the order of the british empire in recognition of outstanding services that were directed toward strengthening business relationships between the united kingdom and the united states in  pigott was named ceo of the year by washington ceo magazine in that same year paccar won the international stevie business award based on the companys consistently producing the highestquality products in their sector along with maintaining strong cost controls and developing new and original technological applications paccar as a global technology company paccar was the worlds secondlargest manufacturer of big rig trucks with sales in north america europe africa and the middle east daimler chryslers freightliner subsidiary was the largest such maker because paccar had consistently been a leader with regards to technology pigott maintained that paccar should rightfully be called a technology company that made trucks not a truck company that used technology paccar designed and manufactured exclusive lines of light medium and heavyduty trucks that included the kenworth peterbilt daf leyland and foden nameplates in addition the company also provided customer support and aftermarket parts for its products paccars other products included braden carco and gearmatic industrial winches except for a few companyowned branches paccars trucks and parts were sold exclusively through independent dealerships the companys paclease and paccar financial corporation subsidiaries sold paccar products in many countries worldwide along with truck leasing and financing services in the early s paccar employed about  people in  factories nine distribution centers and various regional offices around the world four generations of paccar leaders in  william pigott sr – the son of irish immigrants and greatgrandfather of mark pigott founded the seattle car manufacturing company—as paccar was originally known—in west seattle washington where it made logging equipment and trucks the company was incorporated on february   it merged with a portland oregon company twohy brothers in  and was renamed the pacific car and foundry company where it expanded into making rail cars the company was sold to american car and foundry in  and went through several difficult periods during the great depression as demand decreased for rail cars the pigott family did not have control of the company from the late s to the early s paul pigott – william pigotts son and marks grandfather reacquired the company in  and ran it as chairman and ceo until his death in  the company manufactured sherman tanks for use during world war ii at the wars end however in  the company migrated its business into truck manufacturing when it acquired the kenworth motor truck company in seattle washington and later the peterbilt truck company based in california charles m pigott – paul pigotts son and marks father became president in  and added the titles of chairman and ceo three years later on january   pacific car and foundry company changed its name to paccar to better describe the businesses it owned and operated charless son mark pigott the companys chairman and ceo in the early st century succeeded him in  career with paccar pigott worked at the company during the summers while he was in high school during summer breaks from stanford university pigott was employed at paccar dealerships those early experiences which included welding painting trucks operating forklifts and assembling chassis main frames of trucks helped pigott learn almost all aspects of the business after college he was hired in  as an internal auditor pigott advanced in several positions at a number of divisions including peterbilt motors headquartered in denton texas and foden trucks in the united kingdom pigott was hired as vice president of paccar in october  and was promoted in january  to the position of senior vice president in december  he was selected to be paccars executive vice president pigott became a director beginning in  and was promoted to vice chairman in january  pigott became ceo and chairman in january  pigott was a lowkey leader avoiding interviews and the highprofile lifestyles often led by his corporate peers in fact pigott was opposed to the publicityseeking headlines that were all too often prominent in corporate management on the other hand he was very lively and informative when speaking with pride for example about his aerodynamic truck bodies and various custommade accessories inside the cabs an enthusiastic detailoriented leader pigott gained a reputation as one of the most respected world authorities in the trucking industry people who knew the tall lanky pigott frequently commented about how dedicated he was to the company and its people no doubt part of that passion for paccar came from the long family heritage of building vehicles to transport freight paccar in the s during the s pigott continued the consistent customeroriented philosophy that had been adopted by his predecessors within the company pigott also maintained a strong leadership style for paccar consequently paccar was not as negatively affected as other large companies during periodic operational and economic upheavals in the industry pigott spent much of his time in the s supporting new technologies within paccar he was proud of the fact that paccar was one of the few truck manufacturers that incorporated technology in its designing manufacturing and marketing processes for example pigott introduced computer technology when bringing parts into paccar factories this justintime process a set of computer techniques to improve the return on investment by reducing inhouse inventories and their related costs dramatically reduced the amount of storage space needed for paccar area that was eventually turned into additional manufacturing surfaces application of this and other innovative technologies meant that paccar was able to develop new truck lines in months not years like other companies in fact the company was recognized by pc week magazine in  for the quality of its information technology systems according to pigott such investments in technology gave paccar a threetofiveyear lead over its competition with respect to overall ability to design manufacture and market products serve customers and manage finances with very little debt to restrict its operations pigott was able to invest more money in the business for quicker production of its goods such actions yielded greater profits higher market share and better name recognition all of which resulted in paccars winning quality awards from around the world stock analysts who regularly followed paccar agreed that pigotts focus on operational excellence would continue to increase the companys share of this key manufacturing market in  paccars parts division opened a new headquarters building in renton washington the building occupied part of the companys historic pacific car and foundry site the s were also an important growth period for paccar financial corporation which offered inhouse financing for kenworth and peterbilt and for paccars leasing corporation which became one of the  largest fullservice leasing companies in north america by  paccar marketed trucks in more than  countries and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in north america by the end of the s pigott had overseen the inception of several capital projects including a  squarefoot research and development center at its kenworth truck plant in renton an expansion project that nearly doubled the size of its customer call center also in renton and new parts distribution centers in atlanta georgia and leyland england during the late s pigott focused on communication and management systems for its truck dealers and owner operators pigott had paccars dealer management consulting arm offer services for human resources insurance and financial planning dealership operations and management and computer systems management pigott directed paccars driver board and dealer councils to let kenworth and peterbilt drivers and dealers share customer feedback with the paccar management team as a result of pigotts innovations especially with new computer technologies improved design features and greater product quality were incorporated into all of the companys products driving success net income in the first quarter of  at paccar rose  percent to  million compared with  million just one year earlier at the same time revenue rose  percent to  billion from  billion pigott announced that all of paccars segments had strong results with  being the companys secondbest year in its history pigott also participated in various activities outside of paccar he was a member of the washington state roundtable the business council in washington dc the world economic forum in davos switzerland and the society of american engineers and he was active in numerous local charitable organizations in the pacific northwest a tradition of excellence the four generations of pigott men who led paccar achieved quality results for decades earning a net profit and paying a dividend every year since  with pigotts technological innovations and attention to customer services paccar continued to show consistent profits even though the trade and transportation industry went through a dramatic downturn at the beginning of the s mark pigott along with his forebears pursued nearly a century of quality that led to paccars being a strong business leader in the northwestern united states and a major global corporation pigott credited the creative contributions of paccars employees and coordinated efforts by management to expand market share overseas and to invest in facilities new products and information technology for the companys
