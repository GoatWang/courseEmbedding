newswireseptember  reblogsharetweetsharecastle rock colo sept   prnewswire  venaxis® inc appy announced today that following its acquisition of bioptix diagnostics inc bioptix that was announced on september   venaxis has issued the following letter to its shareholders the letter is posted on the companys websitecastle rock codear venaxis shareholderson behalf of the venaxis board of directors i would like to take this opportunity to provide further information regarding our decision to acquire a controlling interest in bioptix diagnostics inc including how venaxis intends to execute on the bioptix opportunity and return longterm value to all of our shareholders  i will also take this opportunity to respond to the recent schedule d filings made with the sec by mr barry honig on investor calls over the past twelve to eighteen months i have described the process employed by the venaxis board and management to evaluate potential merger andor acquisition opportunities  our focus has been primarily on companies in the life science space with commercial stage products and services in which we could leverage our assets to maximize longterm value for the venaxis shareholders we have further focused on opportunities where the venaxis capital and public company listing status would also potentially lead to significant value inflection  our goal during this process was to evaluate as many high quality opportunities meeting our criteria as possible while conserving cash   during this process we extensively interviewed dozens of companies negotiated with a number of promising targets and conducted diligence on several companies including bioptixthe decision to ultimately acquire bioptix represented our assessment after diligence was completed that the acquisition of bioptix including its commercial stage products represented in the view of the board and management the best opportunity available to venaxis to create value for our shareholders  let me explain why  first the market for labelfree instrumentation for drug discovery is large and growing with multiple potential customers including pharmaceutical companies life science companies academic research institutions and contract research organizations   while we certainly recognize that there are large competitors in this estimated  billion market we believe there is room for bioptix which has developed a product with significant performance and cost advantages  as a smaller company in the space bioptix has a significant opportunity to differentiate itself through its science and technical support   second our interviews with bioptix customers and pipeline prospects conducted as part of our diligence process reflected their delight with the bioptix product team and approach to the market   third our technical diligence on the bioptix pi product reflected a highly credible team which has developed a solid product platform using technology which is scalable to future high value products  finally the main things bioptix was missing were the resources needed to fully launch their product and to provide services in the field required to sell and service the pi product and management with proven commercial experience   it was our assessment of the bioptix commercial plan that a relatively modest investment in commercialization of the pi product could create significant momentum for this commercial stage companyanother major factor the venaxis board considered in choosing the bioptix acquisition was the significant value received for the consideration paid which was approximately  of current venaxis outstanding stock no cash was needed to be used in the execution of this transaction  we believe this provides tremendous value particularly considering that over  million was previously invested to develop the pi instrument and bring the product to market   with no regulatory barriers such as fda approval requirements needed to market the pi our funds will be deployed to grow sales improve the product and develop next generation systems  we believe the investment in commercialization will result in a potentially significant return to our shareholdersread morelet me now address the accusations made by mr honig in his recent schedule d filingsmr honig asserts that the bioptix transaction was an inside job which we executed quickly and with limited diligence    as mentioned earlier venaxis evaluated many companies before choosing bioptix  our first significant meeting with bioptix was in april  and we carefully conducted diligence on bioptix and other companies after that  while mr jeffrey peierls who is a longterm investor in venaxis with minimal holdings and a larger investor in bioptix made the initial introduction venaxis evaluated the business and made the decision to acquire bioptix separate of any influence by mr peierls as stated in the attached letter mr peierls fervently objects to the unfounded accusations of mr honig mr honig asserts that the decision to acquire bioptix was made to entrench the venaxis management team and board  while many of the opportunities we evaluated did involve potential transactions where the venaxis management and board would not have been in control after the transaction we did not select the bioptix transaction to entrench the venaxis board and management team  instead we believe it is an advantage to the combined company that the skills and experience of our management team and board provide additional assets to the combined company  we were willing to and did consider potential transactions where such control would not have been present the strand transaction which was announced but ultimately terminated is an example  during our evaluation process mr honig brought to my attention several companies which fell into this category including some where he owned a stake or had a relationship with the potential target  as mr honig is well aware we were open to looking at companies he brought forward and we met with the management teams and conducted preliminary diligence on two of these companies during the process  after our process we determined that the bioptix transaction which can use the skills of the current management team and board of venaxis to complement and enhance the bioptix team coupled with the value acquired for the consideration paid and the ability to deploy our capital and public company experience in a large potential market for a commercialready product created potential longterm value for all of our shareholders  as i mentioned in the investor call on september   our nominating and corporate governance committee of the board is evaluating the skills qualifications and experience of one or more of the legacy bioptix directors and we may add to our board to further enhance the experience and background of our board members in the relevant industries  mr honig asserts that i withheld negative information about bioptix from the venaxis board this is not an accurate statement  my obligation as ceo is to keep our board informed of all relevant information and i have consistently done so as the ceo of venaxis  mr honig has no grounds to impugn my personal integrity and our management team has consistently provided and our board has consistently been vigilant in gathering all relevant facts before making decisions in the exercise of their fiduciary duties for the good of all venaxis shareholdersi find it unfortunate that mr honig has decided to take an adversarial course of action against venaxis  since he became a significant shareholder in the spring of  i have met with and spoken with him on many occasions and have been open to his thoughts and ideas  when he determined that he wanted to propose a new slate of directors recently i told him that any shareholder could of course follow the boardapproved process to propose board candidates  the venaxis nominating and corporate governance committee is evaluating the candidates he has proposed   again the board is committed to serving as fiduciaries for all of the shareholders of venaxisin closing we are excited about moving forward and building value for the venaxis shareholders through developing and growing the exciting bioptix opportunity   i sincerely request your support as we move forwardvery best regards……stephen lundystephen lundy president and chief executive officer attached letter from e jeffrey peierls a venaxis shareholdere jeffrey peierls golden co september  stephen t lundy chief executive officer venaxis inc  south perry street castle rock co re       barry honigs scurrilous letter of september thdear stephena friend spotted mr honigs schedule da filing this afternoon i was shocked to see what i consider defamatory allegations that he made against you and the rest of management and i strongly resent the implication by him that i somehow colluded with you to protect your jobs  im sure that you are aware that honigs call for a special meeting was never mentioned to me during our negotiations over the bioptix acquisition i did hear that honig was acquiring a significant ownership in venaxis stock and that he was urging venaxis to enter into transactions that the board determined were not in the best interest of the companys shareholders  i did not realize however that he was a person who would launch a personal attack against you when you turned down his proposalsmr honig has implied that my ownership in venaxis stock created the perception that the bioptix acquisition was not done on an arms length basis to the contrary my beneficial ownership including a modest number of outofthemoney warrants was in the range of  to  of venaxis outstanding shares before the acquisition that was apparently far less than his ownership when he was pushing his proposalsif venaxis shareholders contact you you might wish to mention my strong preference to receive venaxis shares for my ownership in bioptix during our negotiations rather than being cashed out i strongly disagree with mr honigs allegations regarding the value of bioptix business i feel that the combination of bioptix technology and venaxis resources has the potential to make the shares of venaxis that i received considerably more valuable over a reasonable period of timeplease accept my sympathy for being attacked so unfairly and my best wishes as you build a successful businessbest regardsjeff peierls            about the company venaxis inc through its operating subsidiary bioptix diagnostics inc has developed
