before bieber there was marky mark for calvin klein a look back at the iconic underwear campaign by annchristine diaz published on february   tis the season for spring fashion campaigns and perhaps the most headscratching idea weve seen in the space is this ad although others would beg to differ justin bieber reads like a big taint on the sophisticated seductive and sometimes controversial legacy of calvin klein ads at least in our book because of his utter douchiness its a clear homage to perhaps whats arguably one of the most iconic celebrity fashion marketing moves to date the brands  mens underwear campaign featuring mark wahlberg then known of course as marky mark mark wahlberg for calvin klein the print ads and accompanying spots were created by then calvin klein senior vp neil kraft now founder and cco of kraftworks the company behind the recent plussized model ad for swimsuitsforall running in this years sports illustrated swimsuit issue whether you were a hater or a fan of the pseudorapper its hard to deny that with the campaign something pretty powerful occurred at the intersection of celebrity and fashion the ads revealed a whole new dimension to mr wahlbeg beyond the six pack  and perhaps allowed you to forgive the fact that he associated himself with a posse called the funky bunch looking back they were a prescient sign of his superstardom to come and although calvin klein was probably the name in mens underwear at the time the campaign helped cement that idea in consumer consciousness advertising age player we were repositioning calvins mens underwear line which at the time was a relatively small business mr kraft said it wasnt like we were casting around for a celebrity it was more like what do we do for the new campaign for mens underwear right at the same time mark was on the cover of rolling stone showing his calvin klein underwear both calvin and i saw it and thought this is the guy we need at the time ck had no connection to wahlberg but mr kraft said mr klein was good friends with producer david geffen we approached wahlberg not knowing what would happen but thought he would be a great model and eventually he agreed to do it the campaign was shot by the late herb ritts and featured solo shots and film of mr wahlberg as well as others in which hes accompanied by kate moss mr kraft said that the films in which mr wahlberg raps grabs his crotch and raves about how his calvins dont get stretched out were all unscripted he hadnt done any acting so we had no idea whether he could act mr kraft said but he had a natural likability i think it came through in the print and it came through in the tv no retouching involved mr wahlberg ultimately attracted a broad audience it was a really nice combination  he appealed to women he appealed to gay men and he appealed to men who wanted to be him said mr kraft it all kind of worked together and unlike justin bieber hes incredibly naturally charming and we didnt retouch him and you can only imagine what would have happened had facebook or twitter been around this was fifteen years before social media and cellphones but when we had him up to do fittings people got word of it and across the street they were putting their phone numbers in their windows to this day i cant figure out how they knew he was in the neighborhood mr kraft said that after the campaign the mens underwear business grew exponentially and even the womens line subsequently saw a bump in sales all with a media plan that was only around a million he said as for the difference between the two campaigns marky mark was universally liked justin isnt mr kraft said there is an argument where the more risk you take the more attention you get one of the things i remember calvin saying to me years back was theres no such thing as bad publicity but i do think there are bad associations i think people wanted to be like marky mark i dont think everyone wants to be like justin

dad the selfdescribed multimillionaire owner of fmi products fmi fireplaces  south harbor blvd santa ana ca  who gave me a one hour tour of his onehundred employee factory bragging about his dozens of  machines and his recent origination of a large sixfigure equity line of creditmark klein used tangential braggadocio to guarantee me that his son dane klein an fmi supervisor and danes best friend anthony derenzo were good kids that we should indeed rent an apartment to on mark kleins word right before mark gave us the only check we ever received from his family with lease agreement copy marks doppelgnger was to sign as guarantor but conveniently whited out white out the perfidious mark kleins most trusted post agreement negotiation trick we had to evict mark kleins family in court for never paying one cent of rent or utilities lying to us about being in a criminal street gang and for one of those good kids being charged with street terrorism in just one of at least four separate bloody hate crime incidents instigated by these insidious misanthropes over less than seventy five days incredibly enough mark klein stated that we could trust the kleins who clearly offer both immoral and financial support for their son and his gangbanging friends sc boys san clemente thugs and ocs or orange county skinheads mark klein admits that dane klein is brain damaged but by danes very own admission mark absurdly provides dane with unregistered firearms he was robbed of likely by the very same hate groups with whom he gangbangswhen sheriffs deputies arrived to evict the klein family mark klein made personal appearance and kept dane at good distance for fear of him being taken into custody none of the kleins or their hate mongering friends lifted one finger to clean or repair the holes in the walls and doors nor did they pick up their trash junk and discarded furniture strewn about every room of the home in addition the kleins actually stole my refrigerator and when confronted mark klein reasoned with me that the kleins would simply lie in concert defending against my litigation these myopic interlopers are for sale to the lowest bidder list of damages when dane klein andor his friends including anthony derenzo attacked at least four latinos including a very cordial young man living in our neighborhood who ive known for several years mark klein was asked to pay for the victims lip to be fixed so that the boy didnt have to bare permanent facial disfigurement as evidence of kleins hate mark klein hung up the phone on the young man looks like someone needs a lesson in empathy ask yourself is there another fireplace manufacturer who doesnt underwrite violence and hate since the answer is obviously yes shop elsewhere and dont allow your money to support intolerance endorsing violence the kleins create for recreation out of boredom with your resources this report was posted on ripoff report on   pm and is a permanent record located here

klein but i believe this report was written by a huntington beach scam artist by the name of michael montrief  it contains his identification by use of his favorite words   people should know that since the complaint was written by michael montrief it is undoubtedly not true and on the contrary mr klein probably went out of his way for mr montrief   mr montrief is an individual who has made a large amount of money by scamming and ripping off unsuspecting victims over many years via gross corvette scams as well as housing rentals  he was finally caught and charges were filed against him somewhere between  and   see news report httpabclocalgocomwpvistorysectionnewslocalid he has filed bankruptsy and is running other scams by  renting out foreclosing realestate  by collecting rent in advance the bank cannot reposess the properties until the renters time is up   mr montrief also hides two toyota priuss that are not paid for while waiting for the statute to run out and toyota to give up looking for them  to verify these statements please google michael montrief corvette forum to see the rip off car complaints and  click this link to see renter complaints httpwwwdonotrentcomreviewssilverlanterndanapointca  in  mr montrief received a cease and refrain order for running realestate scams httpwwwcorpcagovenfpdfequityfunddrpdf and later had his real estate license revoked  he is presently attempting to run a new real estate business called fsrefund which he claims will net him  monthly  this is how he slandered another victim in this very website peter liegl httpwwwripoffreportcomrpeterlieglelkhartindianapeterlieglmapletreetransportationrobbedourmoneytimedignitywhilesmirkingupon  the following link is an ebay warning not to do business with him   httpwwwebaycomgdsbewareofbuyingcorvettesfromuscorvettesghtml i am conveying this information because of my personal experience with mr montrief in which he borrowed large amounts of money from me a single mother he never repaid one penny then when i could not loan him anymore he began a barage of emailed threats stating i will teach you a lesson with a website you will never forget and just google peter liegl and then ask yourself how out of your depth you really are  if im not scared of a billionaire who are you etc etc the emails contain threats to me and my children promising to build websites for each of us accusing us all three of illegal illicit and immoral behavior and the threats go on   because of all this i believe that mark klein must have done somethig nice for mr montrief to deserve this ripoff report if you google michael montrief you will find about ten websites all making him out to be some kind of a god or something  these are websites he created as damage control to repair his reputation in the internet  his letter to reputation management odesk contains the following sentences unfortunately some evil people have decided to artificially promote links that now appear higher in search results for my name permutations than those results would otherwise return and please tell us how quickly you can promote these positive websites listed above to outrank all negative posts    i hope this clears things up for anyone wishing to do business with mark klein respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either

after heady success in the s and s the fashion brand fell victim to the dark side of licensing it began as it does with so many brands with a hefty slice of luck thirty nineyears ago mildred custin a fashion buyer from famed department store bonwit teller got out of a hotel lift on the wrong floor and found herself in a small design studio her confusion quickly changed to astonishment as she surveyed the coats and suits being created by the young designer from the bronx working there before leaving custin placed an order for worth of merchandise calvin klein was on his way the brand’s fame grew quickly among the new york elite calvin klein’s couture line for women established the brand as one of the hottest names in american fashion by the late s the brand’s prominence had attracted a raft of licensees licensing is an invisible world to most consumers who believe that if a garment carries calvin klein’s name on the label it must be made by his company in reality only a tiny proportion of the products that carried the logo during the s and s was actually produced by calvin klein instead most of the brand’s sales came from licensed arrangements for coats accessories watches and jewellery hosiery swimwear and fragrances typically brands enjoy royalties of between  and  of the wholesale price of a licensed garment however the strength of the calvin klein brand combined with its apparent flexibility across a huge array of categories ensured that the company enjoyed some of the best royalty arrangements in the world marketing gurus will trot out examples such as ysl and gucci and conclude that licensing is brand poison the reality is not so simple calvin klein proved that licensing can be an effective strategy when the organization tried to manufacture its own products the high costs of production combined with problems of excess inventory almost destroyed it most brands are simply not big or diverse enough to produce and merchandise the products that the global market demands by   of the company’s revenues came from licensees which produced the brand in more than  different categories however there is a dark side to licensing klein discovered it the hard way in  when he tried to sell his company for a rumored figure of bn too much of its success was tied up with other organizations and a buyer could not be found another major downside of calvin klein’s licensing was its increasingly confused brand architecture a multitude of products at different price points left consumers unsure of the positioning of the brand this dilution was compounded by licensees dependent on sales from discount retailers where revenues are brisk but brand equity is bruised in extreme cases calvin klein’s licensees simply ignored their original agreements with the brand klein went so far as to sue one major licensee in  for ‘serious problems as to the quality and the value and the design of the product’ all this took a toll on the brand and by  many us department stores had stopped carrying calvin klein’s topend collections defying its couture origins the brand became associated with fragrances and accessible fashion a recent survey by the luxury institute ranked calvin klein first for familiarity among rich us women and last for status ouch yet just when it seemed that calvin klein’s best days were behind it a savior emerged now read this on calvin klein’s remarkable turnaround and how it was achieved  seconds on … calvin klein – in the s the brand was synonymous with sleek us minimalism and the urban unisex lifestyle – the brand was founded in  by calvin klein and friend benny schwartz klein provided the creative impulse as a recent graduate of manhattan’s fashion institute of technology schwartz provided the business
