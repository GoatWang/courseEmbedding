thyroid nodules using its combined mutational thygenx® and microrna classifier thyramir® testing format fundamental insights into the mechanism of thyroid cancer development and progression are reported as well as a comprehensive statistical analysis of the mutational and microrna profiling features representing the largest integrated analysis of dna and rna alterations in existence for commercially available molecular products in the area of thyroid cancerthe united states and canadian academy of pathology uscap has been the most prestigious provider of continuing medical education cme for pathologists globally for more than a century superbly integrating cme into the process for improving professional practice and patient outcomes by reducing the gap between evidencebased practices and adoption of those practices into clinical care  the organization boasts a membership of  pathologists and other practitioners committed to this goal the accepted posters that will be presented at the conference are entitled the role of mirna expression analysis in needle aspirate cytology of indeterminate thyroid nodules clinical and biological significance of common mutational genotypes of thyroid follicular neoplasia biological aggressiveness of thyroid neoplasia depends on the strength of the genetic mutation and associated cellular interaction and microrna profiling complements microscopicmutational analysis by defining alternative pathways of carcinogenesis according to jack stover president  ceo of interpace we are pleased that this work has been accepted for presentation at the upcoming uscap meeting the acceptance of these four posters by this prestigious international organization reflects the strength of our ongoing commitment to demonstrate the exceptional clinical utility of our tests globallyabout thyroid nodules thygenx and thyramir testingaccording to the american thyroid association approximately  to  of the  thyroid fine needle aspirations fnas performed on an annual basis in the us are indeterminate for malignancy based on standard cytological evaluation and thus are candidates for thygenx® and thyramir®thygenx and thyramir reflex testing yields high predictive value in determining the presence and absence of cancer in thyroid nodules  the combination of both tests can improve risk stratification and surgical decisionmaking when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis for the presence of cancerthygenx utilizes stateoftheart nextgeneration sequencing ngs to identify more than  genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas the two most common forms of thyroid cancer thyramir is the first microrna gene expression classifier  micrornas are small

prnewswire — interpace diagnostics group inc nasdaq idxg a fully integrated commercial company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services announced today the acceptance of four posters to be presented at the upcoming united states and canadian academy of pathology uscap meeting being held march   in san antonio texas the posters reflect a review of data from the company’s extensive experience in molecular thyroid testing including experience with over  analyses of indeterminate thyroid nodules using its combined mutational thygenx® and microrna classifier thyramir® testing format fundamental insights into the mechanism of thyroid cancer development and progression are reported as well as a comprehensive statistical analysis of the mutational and microrna profiling features representing the largest integrated analysis of dna and rna alterations in existence for commercially available molecular products in the area of thyroid cancer the united states and canadian academy of pathology uscap has been the most prestigious provider of continuing medical education cme for pathologists globally for more than a century superbly integrating cme into the process for improving professional practice and patient outcomes by reducing the gap between evidencebased practices and adoption of those practices into clinical care the organization boasts a membership of  pathologists and other practitioners committed to this goal the accepted posters that will be presented at the conference are entitled “the role of mirna expression analysis in needle aspirate cytology of indeterminate thyroid nodules” “clinical and biological significance of common mutational genotypes of thyroid follicular neoplasia” “biological aggressiveness of thyroid neoplasia depends on the strength of the genetic mutation and associated cellular interaction” and “microrna profiling complements microscopicmutational analysis by defining alternative pathways of carcinogenesis” according to jack stover president  ceo of interpace “we are pleased that this work has been accepted for presentation at the upcoming uscap meeting the acceptance of these four posters by this prestigious international organization reflects the strength of our ongoing commitment to demonstrate the exceptional clinical utility of our tests globally” about thyroid nodules thygenx and thyramir testing according to the american thyroid association approximately  to  of the  thyroid fine needle aspirations fnas performed on an annual basis in the us are indeterminate for malignancy based on standard cytological evaluation and thus are candidates for thygenx® and thyramir® thygenx and thyramir reflex testing yields high predictive value in determining the presence and absence of cancer in thyroid nodules the combination of both tests can improve risk stratification and surgical decisionmaking when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis for the presence of cancer thygenx utilizes stateoftheart nextgeneration sequencing ngs to identify more than  genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas the two most common forms of thyroid cancer thyramir is the first microrna gene expression classifier micrornas are small noncoding rnas that bind to messenger rna and regulate expression of genes involved in

services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for better patient diagnosis and management reported today that the company has launched a new version of their accucea product called insights for gastroenterologists who focus on diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancerthe new accucea insights service provides physicians for whom the company has already provided first line testing with additional information on how those results compare to those of other patients in the companys proprietary database of over  patients thus reporting incremental and valuable information on the patients potential molecular profile and overall risk for developing pancreatic cancer when the report is delivered to the ordering physician they have an opportunity to speak with one of the companys expert molecular pathologists and discuss the potential benefits of conducting a full molecular pathology review using pancragen® the companys fully integrated product that considers all the results from first line testing imaging cytology and molecular testing and stratifies the patient in one of  risk categories interpace diagnostics who has offered their accucea product to customers for over  years will continue to offer accucea in addition to accucea insights the primary benefit of the accucea product vs traditional carcinoembryonic antigen or cea testing available from other labs is that accucea is the only cea assay that has been validated on small ul amounts of cyst fluid interpace currently performs over  accucea tests per year for their customers  cea is a blood fluid chemistry test that is commonly done as part of an initial screening performed on patients suspected of having pancreatic and other types of cancer  this test along with other common fluid chemistry tests like amylase may also be referred to as first line testing the additional information provided via accucea insights provides physicians a more expansive view of their patients status and enables them to make an informed decision regarding the most appropriate next steps said interpace president and ceo jack stover we believe customers who currently order first line testing services only will see the value in not only the incremental information provided via accucea insights but the full benefits of our fully integrated molecular product pancragenabout pancragen®pancragen® is a pancreatic cyst molecular test that by using a small sample of pancreatic cyst fluid can aid in pancreatic cancer risk assessment pancragen® is  accurate according to clinical studies enabling effective risk stratification of patients  pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced because of this and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of

sell  shares of our common stock at a price of  per share to certain institutional investors the second registered direct offering resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately  million we are using the net proceeds from the second registered direct offering for working capital repayment of indebtedness and general corporate purposes in addition we granted each institutional investor who

we operated under two reporting segments commercial services and interpace diagnostics the cso business is reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented interpace diagnostics group inc interpace diagnostics we recognize revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our revenue is generated using our proprietary tests and related services our performance obligation is fulfilled upon the completion review and release of test results in conjunction with fulfilling these services we bill the thirdparty payor or hospital we recognize our revenue related to billings for medicare medicare advantage and hospitals on an accrual basis net of contractual adjustment when a contract is in place a reliable pattern of collectability exists and collectability is reasonably assured contractual adjustments represent the difference between the list prices and the reimbursement rate set by medicare and medicare advantage the contractual rate or the amounts agreed to with hospitals until a contract has been negotiated with a commercial insurance carrier or governmental program the services may or may not be covered by these entities existing reimbursement policies in the absence of an agreement with the patient or other clearly enforceable legal right to demand payment the related revenue is only recognized upon the earlier of payment notification or cash receipt accordingly we recognize revenue from commercial insurance carriers government programs and directbill healthcare providers without contracts when payment is received persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery is deemed to have occurred upon completion review and release of the test results at which time we will bill the thirdparty payor or hospital the assessment of the fixed or determinable nature of the fees charged for diagnostic testing performed and the collectability of those fees requires significant judgment by our management our management believes that these two criteria have been met when there is contracted reimbursement coverage or a predictable pattern of collectability with individual thirdparty payors or hospitals and accordingly recognizes revenue upon delivery of the test results in the absence of contracted reimbursement coverage or a predictable pattern of collectability we believe that the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured only upon request of thirdparty payor notification of payment or when cash is received and we recognize revenue at that time cost of services consists primarily of the costs associated with operating our laboratories and other costs directly related to our tests personnel costs which constitute the largest portion of cost of services include all labor related costs such as salaries bonuses fringe benefits and payroll taxes for laboratory personnel other direct costs include but are not limited to laboratory supplies certain consulting expenses and facility expenses interpace
