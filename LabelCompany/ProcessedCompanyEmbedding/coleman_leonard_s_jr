leonard s coleman jr — sports administrator baseball and politics politics and baseball a dream fulfilled sources when he assumed the presidency of baseball’s national league in  leonard s coleman jr became the highestranking african american executive in professional sports a native of new jersey and a lifelong baseball fan coleman faces the task of restoring baseball’s public image in the wake of a lengthy players’ strike he must also be the final arbiter in onfield disputes whether they concern rival players players and umpires or managers coleman is deeply concerned that professional baseball has alienated its fans who perceive both its owners and its players as greedy and concerned only with their own gains as president of the national league he plans to do what he can to restore the oldtime feeling of baseball as a source of national pride and local identity “we have to create a greater focus on the game for the fans so they can enjoy the game and not have to hear as much rhetoric about the business aspects of baseball” he told ebony magazine “we have to understand that the business of our game is the fans” one of those fans is coleman himself “the first thing i can ever remember loving is baseball” he noted in the new york times “there aren’t too many people who get an opportunity to make their living at the first thing they ever loved” baseball and politics coleman was born in newark but he grew up in montclair new jersey a village not far from new york city he lived in a twofamily home which his parents shared with an uncle and everyone seemed to root for a different baseball team coleman and his mother liked the brooklyn dodgers coleman’s father preferred the new york giants to make life interesting the uncle cheered for the yankees “everything in our house was politics and baseball” the league president recalled in the new york times “that’s all we talked about” at montclair high school coleman played baseball and football becoming best known for his football skills he was named allstate and allamerican at halfback during his senior year an accomplishment that he still points to with pride “i was part of an allstate backfield with joe theismann franco harris and jack tatum” he remembered in sports illustrated “i’m the only one without a super bowl ring” coleman continued playing baseball and football as an at a glance… b orn

felt that he was not being given enough opportunity to prove himself with the team—and he thought his race was the reason as a sophomore he joined two other black players in a protest charging the princeton football program with violations of the university’s policy of equal opportunity for minorities when the complaints drew national attention coleman and his two friends were dismissed from the team but a panel charged with investigating the incident urged greater sensitivity toward minority students in the athletic program coleman told the new york times that the experience “changed my life in many ways” especially helping him to develop a keen social consciousness after earning his bachelor’s degree from princeton in  coleman moved on to harvard university where he pursued dual master’s degrees in public administration and education with such stellar academic credentials he might have entered the work force on the fast track but instead in  he accepted a position as a missionary to africa for the protestant episcopal church there he put his education and expertise to work as a consultant on health care education and community services all told he spent four years in africa serving in  different countries and cultivating a close friendship with south african archbishop desmond tutu “i matured while i was overseas and i found out about the warmth and affection of the people” coleman recalled in ebony “everywhere i went there was a new and exciting experience” politics and baseball returning to america in  coleman began to consider a career in politics he first served as president of the greater newark urban coalition an organization that sought to create liaisons between businesses community groups and government in  he was appointed commissioner of the new jersey department of energy there he became an important member of the administration of republican new jersey governor thomas h kean during this period he also married gabriella morris an attorney leonard coleman was hardly the stereotypical public servant however midway through his fouryear appointment to new jersey’s energy department at age  he worked his way into the metropolitan baseball league a semipro affiliation catering to college players and other young pro baseball hopefuls his late fling with baseball was the source of much joking in the governor’s cabinet but on the field coleman was a serious competitor over two years of play he compiled a  career batting average he explained in ebony that the semipro experience satisfied his aspirations as a baseball player “i loved playing baseball but i was realistic enough to know that i wasn’t going to make it to the major leagues” he said handsome and affable coleman proved to be a great asset to the republican party in new jersey he helped to promote governor kean among black voters in such cities as newark trenton and camden and indeed kean earned more votes in those cities than any republican had in years in  kean named coleman commissioner of the new jersey department of community affairs another cabinetlevel position with an annual budget of some  million coleman had greater ambitions as well at one time entertaining the idea of running for a senate seat he was popular and wellknown in new jersey especially among republicans but when the  senatorial campaign got underway kean supported pete dawkins a white republican dawkins was subsequently beaten soundly by democrat frank lautenberg coleman never made an issue of the campaign and in fact he supported dawkins as well but in  he left the public sector for a job as an investment banker with the prominent new york firm kidder peabody  co he has expressed no interest in returning to national politics since that time a dream fulfilled coleman eventually was named vice president of municipal finance for kidder peabody and he might have spent the rest of his career there instead in  he accepted his first position with major league baseball director of market development coleman was charged with the task of reviving fan interest in baseball at a time when attendance was beginning to slip in many markets he decided that the best way to prepare professional baseball for a bright future was to spark more interest in the game among youngsters one program that caught his attention was reviving baseball in the inner cities also known as rbi an initiative aimed at keeping city teenagers active in baseball after they leave the little leagues the program began modestly but has—with coleman’s encouragementexpanded to more than  cities bringing with it new playing fields equipment and organized baseball programs in march of  the owners of the national league baseball teams unanimously chose coleman to succeed outgoing bill white as president of the national league coleman described his new position in sports illustrated as “a dream come true” at first glance the job does look ideal league presidents are paid to fly around and attend bigleague baseball games they get the best seats at any sporting event—not just baseball but everything from the super bowl to the us open tennis tournament to the olympics their philosophies shape the game in ways both large and small governing everything from the fines levied for a fight between players to the image of the game itself the national league presidency is a highprofile position one of the most important in organized professional sports and the job holder is treated accordingly the dream can become a nightmare however coleman began his duties with the national league just as one of the worst players’ strikes in history was taking shape the strike brought cancellation of a good part of the regular season in  as well as all postseason play and tarnished the image of the national pastime to coleman fell the task of restoring baseball’s image and promoting the game as wholesome family entertainment asked what he would like to accomplish as national league president by the sporting news coleman replied “in terms of fans we want an exciting product on the field that they can be proud of and relate to” he added “i think baseball historically has had the roots within our north american society as the national pastime baseball has had an impact off the field and on i look at some of the problems in our country with education with getting children immunized we have a role as hopefully a community citizen to help where we possibly can” with such a philosophy in place it is not surprising that coleman has proven to be a tougher disciplinarian than his predecessors “violence certainly has become much more prevalent in our society and i don’t think it has a place in our sport” he commented in the new york times coleman has been decisive about handing out fines and suspensions to brawling players he has joined current and former players in a muchpublicized campaign against the use of chewing tobacco during games and he has actively encouraged players to spend more time reaching out to fans especially children “baseball is going to have to provide hope and provide some type of vision in society so that kids’ lives in this country can be better because of this sport” he explained in ebony not surprisingly coleman has also been a crusader for the rights of african american baseball players he was instrumental in persuading major league baseball to open its health insurance plan to the players and the spouses of players who participated in the negro leagues he also helped to design a plan that provides pension money to former negro league players earned from the sale of negro leagues merchandise that is marketed by major league baseball baseball purists have been relieved to discover that coleman has no plans to introduce the designated hitter rule to the national league “i like the national league style of play” he said in the sporting news “it’s not going to be leading any movements for any change” what coleman would like to see change is the message professional baseball is sending to its viewers “it used to be that baseball had a strong connection with society” coleman explained in the new york times “it was always able to transcend the field in a variety of very positive ways now though the only message we have been communicating is money money money that is not a message we should be communicating” instead coleman envisions such improvements as less drug abuse among players less fighting during games and more promotion of baseball as entertainment for the whole family “we need to be role models and try to encourage players to be such” he maintained in the sporting news “if you look at the game of baseball it’s been one of the great continuities of life there’s a certain flow to it you don’t want to tinker with it on the field but any ways you can enhance the fans’ enjoyment you do that” coleman continues to live in montclair new jersey with his wife son and daughter his busy schedule may take him to as many as five different american cities in as many days and he sees as many ball games in person as he possibly can “i am thoroughly enjoying my work at major league baseball” he told the new york times “i feel blessed that i’ve had several gratifying careers” sources black enterprise july   ebony june  pp  june  p  new york times march   p nj may   p a september   p nj sporting

coleman developed a passion for baseball in high school he lettered in baseball while excelling in football being named allstate and allamerican at halfback during his senior year leonard coleman continued playing baseball and football as an undergraduate at princeton university becoming the first black player ever to score a touchdown for that prestigious ivyleague school still he felt that he was not being given enough opportunity to prove himself with the teamand he thought his race was the reason as a sophomore he joined two other black players in a protest charging the princeton football program with violations of the universitys policy of equal opportunity for minorities when the complaints drew national attention coleman and his two friends were dismissed from the team but a panel charged with investigating the incident urged greater sensitivity toward minority students in the athletic program after earning his bachelors degree from princeton in  coleman moved on to harvard university where he pursued dual masters degrees in public administration and education with such stellar academic credentials he might have entered the work force on the fast track but instead in  he accepted a position as a missionary to africa for the protestant episcopal church there he put his education and expertise to work as a consultant on health care education and community services all told he spent four years in africa serving in  different countries returning to new jersey in  leonard coleman began to consider a career in politics he first served as president of the greater newark urban coalition an organization that sought to create liaisons between businesses community groups and government in  he was appointed commissioner of the new jersey department of energy  coleman was hardly the stereotypical public servant however midway through his fouryear appointment to new jerseys energy department at age  he worked his way into the metropolitan baseball league a semipro affiliation catering to college players and other young pro baseball hopefuls his late fling with baseball was the source of much joking in the governors cabinet but on the field coleman was a serious competitor over two years of play he compiled a  career batting average leonard coleman proved to be a great asset to the republican party in new jersey he helped to promote governor kean among black voters in such cities as newark trenton and camden and indeed kean earned more votes in those cities than any republican had in years in  kean named coleman commissioner of the new jersey department of community affairs another cabinet level position with an annual budget of some  million coleman had greater ambitions as well at one time entertaining the idea of running for a senate seat after losing in the primary in  coleman left the public sector for a job as an investment banker with the prominent new york firm kidder peabody  co coleman eventually was named vice

development coleman was charged with the task of reviving fan interest in baseball at a time when attendance was beginning to slip in many markets he decided that the best way to prepare professional baseball for a bright future was to spark more interest in the game among youngsters one program that caught his attention was reviving baseball in the inner cities an initiative aimed at keeping city teenagers active in baseball after they leave the little leagues the program began modestly but haswith colemans encouragementexpanded to more than  cities bringing with it new playing fields equipment and organized baseball programs in march of  the owners of the national league baseball teams unanimously chose coleman to succeed outgoing bill white as president of the national league coleman described his new position in sports illustrated as a dream come true however the dream can become a nightmare as coleman began his duties with the nl a strike that cancelled the end of the season postseason and world series was just beginning tarnishing the image of the national pastime to coleman fell the task of restoring baseballs image and promoting the game as wholesome family entertainment baseball would eventually bounce back but in  leonard coleman was out of a job as the nl and al presidents offices were abolished coleman would go on to take a job as paid advisor to bud

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
