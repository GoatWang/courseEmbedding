blackmore lidar  redefined our mission is to ignite the accessibilityof dimensional geospatial data  blackmores lidar engine enables unsurpassed performance across the broad application space of d lidar imagingby translating the advanced toolsets of modern radar into the optical domain we are driving revolutionary cost and performance gainsthe inherent scalability of the blackmore approach affords us the unique ability to produce quantities in line with the growth of the autonomous driving industry while blackmore inc has become known as the first lidar system to enter the market with the capability of instantaneous measurement of object velocity the doppler field is really only the beginning of the story blackmore’s approach to fmcw lidar measurement also allows forpointbypoint scene segmentation single photon sensitivity and a new paradigm for interference rejectionsee the level of scene segmentation possible in this short clip  pay close attention to the pointbypoint doppler shifts that occur as the various regions of the subject move at different speeds and in different directions want to learn more contact us automotive — blackmore lidar for automotive our lidar automotive solutions  blackmore is applying fmcw lidar techniques to automotive applicationsthis means a unique ability to instantly measure velocity by capturing doppler data of moving objects  see this in action below with doppler shifts instantaneously shaded in blues and reds  all of this data was collected in a single pass through the scene with doppler data processed in real timethe blackmore lidar system uses only a single forwardlook sensor with a horizontal field of view of about  degrees multiplexing of the scanner over the next few months will enable a much wider field of viewthe blackmore lidar system collects and processes data in a way that enables it to be viewed as “first person” or from any number of angles or viewpoints   the inherent flexibility of the approach leads to critical performance advantages and a clear pathway to mass production  prototype units are expected in mid    want to learn more contact us careers — blackmore careerswere always looking for
