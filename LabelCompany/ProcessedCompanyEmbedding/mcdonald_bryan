have access to sufficient food to lead active and healthy lives despite great global effort rising food prices have motivated unrest in many parts of the world and increased the number of people who do not receive proper nutrition national and international food safety incidents have raised awareness of the ability of the food supply to transfer health threats to people and animals agricultural and load production activities are key drivers of environmental and climate change while also being likely to face significant impacts from these changes in coming decadesin this book bryan mcdonald explores how processes of globalization and global change have reshaped food systems in ways that have significant impacts for national and human security local regional and national food systems have increasingly become intertwined in an emerging global food network this complex web of relations includes the production harvest processing transport and consumption of food while this global food network provides new opportunities for improving health and wellbeing it also gives rise to new sources of security threats and vulnerabilitiesthis detailed and comprehensive introduction to the major issues impacting global food security will be essential reading for students and scholars in security studies international politics and environmental studiesessayscondition hpb condition ratingsnew
