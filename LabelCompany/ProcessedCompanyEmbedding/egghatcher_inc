to win home → chick brooders ecoglow chick brooders  safe and efficient brinsea® ecoglow chick brooders are highly efficient low cost brooders ideal for keeping newly hatched chicken game and waterfowl warm they are available in  sizes the ecoglow  suitable for up to  chicks and the ecoglow  for up to  chicks these radiant heaters are far more efficient than conventional infra red brooder lamps as well as being much safer since they run from a volts transformer the brooder panel height can be adjusted to match chicks of different sizes from quail to goose products more information the ecoglow chick brooders are designed to be extremely economical to use especially for small numbers of birds  a typical heat lamp runs at  watts compared with  watts for the ecoglow  considering the brooder is on  this is an important saving   to get the best use from this low power unit it is important to understand that there is no big margin of ‘spare’ heat and some precautions need to be taken depending on the ambient temperature in the room and on the age and number of chicks –and the size or species   first it is better to have the unit on a lower height setting if in doubt  the chicks will move away from the ecoglow if they are too warm  if brooding very young quail or very small numbers of any small birds it is a good idea to confine them in a cardboard box at least twice the size of the ecoglow but put the brooder against one side of the box so that the birds can only enter on the other side  this conserves warmth under the brooder but still allows birds to move freely out into the open as they wish  another useful trick is to put the whole box on a slab of ” styrofoam to reduce heat loss from the bottom    in an extreme case it can be useful to remove one end of the ecoglow so that it rests directly on the floor  the other end is best at the middle or higher position  this gives very small birds to option to touch the warm surface or adjust their position for maximum comfort   because the heat from the black underside of the ecoglow is largely radiant measuring the temperature with a thermometer is of little value  radiant heat passes through air without warming it only a solid object will absorb and be warmed by radiant heat so a thermometer will register the air temperature but not the radiant heat and will usually show some  to °f lower than the effective temperature felt by the chicks  always watch the behavior of the birds  they will naturally huddle together if they are cool  the more of them the less external warmth they need   for larger numbers of birds two to four ecoglow  can be assembled side by side  above four units it is probably better to leave a gap between units for birds to exit freely the new larger ecoglow  is
