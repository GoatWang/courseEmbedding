jefferson national would it be advisable to switch from my annuity to another type of investment its difficult to provide an in depth response without having some more detail on the type of annuity and your overall financial profile  that said here are some points to consider and potentially present to your financial or tax advisor lets assume that you have a variable annuity  variable annuities can be very expensive with total fees ranging from   over  percent  high fees are a huge drag on investment performance so this is a real consideration  this site publishes a basic database that has fee information for hundreds of different variable annuities  think about doing some basic research or asking your financial advisor to understand what total fees are for your product you really need to understand whether you would incur surrender fees  surrender charges if you terminate your annuity  you may be beyong the timeframe that these fees would apply but you want to look at the product prospectus or ask your advisor if they apply to avoid any fees  keep in mind that not all variable annuities come with high fees  for example jefferson national provides a very interesting low fee variable annuity  annuitiesincluding variable annuitiesare tax advantaged products  these tax advantages are meaningful  you should consider this in light of any change and discuss with your advisors

generating features associated with their variable annuities  maybe this is relevant to you and maybe its not  if you are not going to use the income features though you may want to reconsider how much you are paying for what is simply being used as a tax advantaged investment vehicle  there are lower cost options to capture tax advantages such as the jefferson national va mentioned earlier  in

favorable tax strategies available are currently under review eventually the money is taxed as ordinary income when you start receiving regular payments from the annuity with certain types of

money out in the first five to  years can also reduce tax benefits no frills annuities have low fees buying lowfee stripped down annuities is another great tax deferral strategy these annuities offer no extras and charge low management fees which helps preserve the tax benefits a study by jefferson national life insurance company looked at a variety of assets that were held in taxdeferred accounts and examined at what point the fees charged by these products started to negate the benefits of the tax deferral they discovered that when the management fees of an annuity go over  percent the tax

as set forth below iii on the basis of this order and respondents offer the commission finds that overview  from in or about october  through september  respondents inviva a private new yorkbased insurance holding company and jefferson national an inviva subsidiary that issued variable annuities allowed a group of hedge funds and customers of registered representatives to engage in market timing trading on behalf of jefferson national variable annuity contract owners  in october  inviva purchased conseco variable life insurance company cvic from conseco life insurance company of texas conseco life an affiliate of conseco inc conseco among other products cvic issued the monument series individual and group fixed and variable annuity monument and advantage plus fixed and variable annuity advantage plus products purchasers of the monument and advantage plus products could invest in mutual fund portfolios managed by various fund complexes the prospectuses for the monument and advantage plus products indicated that cvic reserved the right to take steps to prevent detrimental market timing in fact as of the time inviva purchased cvic cvic had permitted select clients to purchase monument and advantage plus variable annuities for the express purpose of market timing certain unaffiliated mutual fund portfolios by october  these clients had invested approximately  million in monument and advantage plus variable annuities ultimately market timers invested approximately  million in the monument and advantage plus products  after invivas purchase of cvic conseco services llc conseco services a conseco affiliate continued to provide services pursuant to a transition services agreement through the end of april  and continued to allow market timing throughout the transition period during the transition period inviva was aware that cvic customers were engaged in market timing and inviva earned the fees that the variable annuity business generated in may  inviva renamed cvic as jefferson national and took over daytoday management of the business the market timing conduct continued  as had been the case with cvics prospectuses jefferson nationals prospectuses for the monument and advantage plus products reserved jefferson nationals right to take steps to prevent detrimental market timing inviva however permitted hedge funds and brokerage customers and registered representatives who traded on their behalf to continue to engage in market timing through jefferson national variable annuities through their frequent trading these market timers diluted the value of the underlying mutual funds that were timed respondents  inviva a delaware corporation is a privatelyheld holding company inviva is headquartered in new york new york with substantial operations in louisville kentucky inviva purchased the stock of cvic from conseco life in october  inviva operates primarily through two subsidiary insurance companies one of which is jefferson national  jefferson national the former cvic is a life insurance company incorporated in texas jefferson national is licensed to sell insurance products in fortynine states and the district of columbia jefferson national is an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of inviva jefferson national served as the depositor of jefferson national life annuity account g and jefferson national life annuity account h which are registered with the commission as unit investment trusts and are the issuers of the monument and advantage plus products respectively inviva administers jefferson nationals life and annuity products pursuant to an administrative services agreement background a market timing  market timing includes a frequent buying and selling of shares of the same mutual fund or b buying or selling mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing market timing while not illegal per se can harm other mutual fund shareholders because a it can dilute the value of their shares if the market timer is exploiting pricing inefficiencies b it can disrupt the management of the mutual funds investment portfolio and c it can cause the targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to accommodate the market timers frequent buying and selling of shares b variable annuities  variable annuities are securities variable annuities are insurance contracts that provide for taxdeferred accumulation during the accumulation period and various payout options including a series of payments to be made to a person named as the annuitant in the contract the payments typically come at the annuitants retirement hedge funds and others that engage in market timing through variable annuities however do not purchase the products in order to obtain the retirement income rather they purchase variable annuities to be able to market time the underlying mutual fund portfolios  assets invested in variable annuities are used to purchase securities and the size of the payments to the annuitant typically depends on the performance of the underlying securities variable annuity products typically offer access to mutual funds contract owners are able to invest in a variety of mutual funds at several mutual fund complexes through subaccounts of the insurance company that hold shares of the funds funds underlying variable annuity products are offered to insurance company separate accounts and certain taxqualified retirement plans but are not sold to the general public in some cases the funds are managed similarly to the corresponding retail funds offered by the fund complex the insurance company and mutual fund complexes enter into participation agreements in general the annuity contracts allow the contract owner to place securities orders with the insurance company typically the variable annuity company combines all buy and sell orders for a particular portfolio and submits a single net order to the mutual fund complex  insurance companies offer their variable annuity products through prospectuses filed with the commission among other things the product prospectuses set out the costs of the annuity the funds offered and language concerning executing orders the prospectuses may also describe the insurance companies policies on market timing the insurance companies deliver the variable annuity prospectuses to prospective purchasers of variable annuity contracts together with the prospectuses for the various mutual funds available for investment the fund prospectuses provide additional information on the particular fund and may include policies about excessive trading or market timing  as with market timing of mutual funds market timing through variable annuities can result in increased expense to and cause dilution in the underlying mutual fund portfolios thus market timing through variable annuities can cause harm not only to other variable annuity purchasers at the insurance company that issued the variable annuities but also to purchasers at other insurance companies invested in the portfolios being timed c inviva facilitated market timing inviva acquired cvic  in october  inviva purchased the stock of cvic from conseco life inviva then began to make arrangements to take over operation of the variable annuity business from october  to april   conseco services provided various services to help with the transition of the business pursuant to a services contract  throughout the transition period inviva offered the monument and advantage plus products under the cvic name and received all fees from the sale and maintenance of the variable annuity contracts inviva paid certain administrative fees to conseco services for administering the business during that time the transition was completed concurrently with jefferson nationals filing with the commission the may   prospectuses for the monument and advantage plus variable annuity products  at the time inviva acquired cvic market timing assets constituted the vast majority of assets invested through the monument product market timing assets continued to dominate the monument product both through the transition period and after inviva assumed full control of the variable annuity business until september   inviva and jefferson national continued to allow market timing in the monument and advantage plus products until approximately september  after the new york attorney generals office filed its complaint against canary capital llc in september  market timing contract owners surrendered their contracts and withdrew funds constituting a majority of the assets in the monument product the monument and advantage plus prospectuses  the monument and advantage plus variable annuity products made available approximately sixty mutual fund portfolios offered by nineteen different fund complexes none of which were affiliated with jefferson national significantly the monument product had no surrender fee which permitted the annuity contract owner to redeem the variable annuity at any time without having to pay a penalty in contrast advantage plus had a surrender fee that decreased over time  during the transition period the invivaowned cvic issued the monument and advantage plus variable annuities pursuant to prospectuses dated may   which had been prepared before inviva purchased cvic under a section entitled highlights the monument and advantage plus prospectuses stated that the product was intended to be used to accumulate money for retirement or other longterm taxdeferred investment purposes  the monument and advantage plus prospectuses also contained a section entitled transfers which were defined as movements of money between investment options this section provided that contract owners were permitted one free transfer between subaccounts per day period further the monument prospectus provided that for any additional transfers a transfer fee of the lesser of  or  of the amount transferred may be deducted similarly under a section entitled transfer fee the advantage plus prospectus indicated contract owners might be charged a transfer fee of  per transfer for any additional transfers in a different section the advantage plus prospectus indicated that a  fee may be deducted for additional transfers  the may   monument prospectus further stated as follows this product is not designed for professional market timing organizations cvic reserves the right to modify including terminating the transfer privileges described above the may   advantage plus prospectus contained substantially similar language  finally the monument and advantage plus may   prospectuses contained a section entitled excessive trading limits this section contained language indicating that cvic was monitoring excessive trading with a view toward protecting all contract owners investments specifically the monument and advantage plus prospectuses stated the following we reserve the right to limit transfers in any contract year or to refuse any transfer request for a contract owner or third party advisor acting under a limited power of attorney if we believe in our sole discretion that excessive trading by the contract owner or a specific transfer request submitted by a third party advisor or a group of transfer requests may have a detrimental effect on the accumulation unit values of any subaccount or the share prices of any portfolio or would be detrimental to other contract owners or we are informed by one or more portfolios that they intend to restrict the purchase of portfolio shares because of excessive trading or because they believe that a specific transfer or group of transfers would have a detrimental effect on the price of portfolio shares we may apply the restrictions in any manner reasonably designed to prevent transfers that we consider disadvantageous to other contract owners  starting on may   inviva and jefferson national began to issue the monument and advantage plus products under the jefferson national name and filed new prospectuses with the commission  the may   jefferson national monument and advantage plus prospectuses again contained language that discouraged market timing the prospectuses indicated that the products were not designed for professional market timing organizations and that jefferson national reserved the right to modify the transfer privileges specifically the prospectuses contained the following your right to make transfers is subject to modification if we determine in our sole opinion that the exercise of the right by one or more owners is or would be to the disadvantage of other owners restrictions may be applied in any manner reasonably designed to prevent any use of the transfer right which is considered by us to be to the disadvantage of other owners a modification could be applied to transfers to or from one or more of the investment portfolios and could include but is not limited to a the requirement of a minimum time period between each transfer b not accepting a transfer request from an agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one owner or c limiting the dollar amount that may be transferred between investment portfolios by an owner at any one time we reserve the right at any time and without prior notice to any party to terminate suspend or modify the transfer privilege during the accumulation period  further the jefferson national monument and advantage plus prospectuses reiterated the excessive trading limits set forth above from the cvic prospectuses in addition the jefferson national prospectuses identified an additional basis for limiting transfers in particular jefferson national reserved the right to limit transfers under the following circumstances your transfer request would result in a redemption of a substantive amount from an investment portfolio that had been allocated to that portfolio for less than  days substantive means a dollar amount that jefferson national determines in its sole discretion could adversely affect the management of the investment portfolio  finally the jefferson national monument prospectus indicated as cvics may   prospectus had done that contract owners were permitted twelve free transfers per year and that jefferson national might impose a fee of  or  whichever was less for additional transfers the advantage plus prospectus indicated that contract owners could make up to twelve transfers per year without charge and that a  transfer fee might be deducted for additional transfers  the jefferson national monument and advantage plus prospectuses failed to disclose however that jefferson national was selling the products to market timers further the prospectuses failed to disclose that jefferson national was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy in addition the prospectuses failed to disclose the risk that the market timers rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers investment returns inviva facilitated market timing  during the october may  transition period two conseco services employees introduced inviva employees to certain of cvics market timing customers and brokers whom the conseco services employees referred to as big ticket customers the conseco services employees informed inviva employees about how to deal with the big ticket traders the conseco services employees gave inviva employees information identifying both cvics market timing customers and the amount of timing capacity available at unaffiliated fund complexes that had permitted timing in their funds inviva did not disclose the existence of the permitted capacity or its arrangements with funds that permitted market timing to its other annuitants  in january  a registered representative at a brokerdealer who represented market timers requested additional market timing capacity for the representatives customers an inviva employee then spoke with a fund representative who agreed that inviva could have an additional  million in timing capacity the registered representatives customers invested the assets and inviva agreed to pay the registered representative an override or extra commission of  basis points of the value of assets the customers invested according to an inviva employee the fund representative that had granted the request for additional timing capacity subsequently requested that inviva add the fund complexs short term bond fund to the jefferson national monument and advantage plus mutual fund offerings and thereafter required big ticket customers to keep their timing assets in the short term bond fund when not being used to time other funds doing this had the effect of increasing the fees that the fund complex earned  after the transition period inviva and jefferson national allowed the market timing to continue in accordance with the limits cvic had received from the unaffiliated mutual funds invivas director of sales and marketing apparently recognized the advantages of managing market timing assets and suggested obtaining timing capacity at other mutual fund complexes a may   email from the director to another inviva employee indicated that we should probably put together a list of funds people want to use that wont let us and go tour the fund companies explaining how it is a harmless and cheap way to take in some money  although the market timers executed significantly more than the permissible number of free transfers jefferson national did not exercise the right to impose the transfer fee set out in the monument and advantage plus prospectuses further jefferson national did not make any independent effort to determine whether market timing was harmful to other jefferson national variable annuity purchasers  with respect to funds that had not agreed to provide capacity for timing assets inviva did not prevent timers from trading in those funds unless the fund complained instead jefferson national simply followed the various unaffiliated mutual fund complexes instructions including instructions to block trades when the fund complexes identified a jefferson national customer as a market timer moreover jefferson national did not inform these fund complexes that certain monument and advantage plus customers were executing a market timing strategy  on march   a conseco services employee sent an email to an inviva employee concerning timers that the conseco services employee had identified as having traded in a fund that had not agreed to provide timing capacity the conseco services employee asked the inviva employee to advise the fund complex that cvic had identified the timers and that cvic does not tolerate timers both the conseco services and inviva employees knew however that cvic not only tolerated market timers but also solicited market timers  in late april  a representative of a fund that had not agreed to provide timing capacity and indeed had previously closed a europe fund portfolio to cvic investors due to market timing sent an email to the same inviva employee in the email the fund representative confirmed that the fund would reopen the portfolio to jefferson national investors based on your zero tolerance policy and procedures you communicated to me with respect to kicking out timers from the products where the funds portfolios are available in fact jefferson national did not maintain a zero tolerance policy and did not kick timers out of the monument and advantage plus products  in early may  one of the funds that had agreed to provide capacity for timing assets informed inviva that the allowed timing capacity in the funds emerging markets portfolio needed to be reduced from approximately  million to  million ie a decrease of  million the inviva employee that had received the march   email then divided the  million in available capacity among certain favored timing clients the timers advised the inviva employee that they intended to invest the  million that was no longer permitted in the emerging markets portfolio in other international funds which had not agreed to provide timing capacity until additional capacity became available in the emerging markets portfolio although the inviva employee warned the timers that the international funds might complain if they traded in and out the employee did not inform these international funds that timers intended to use their funds  in a may   email the same inviva employee asked another inviva employee whether there was any way to verify if big dollars are going to the illegal international funds the other inviva employee replied that i know there is sic a number of timers playing in and out of a worldwide growth portfolio that had not agreed to provide timing capacity with moves of k or less just enough to stay below the radar  in august  the inviva employee who had divided the  million in timing capacity learned that there was no more timing capacity in the emerging markets portfolio the inviva employee sent an email on august   to the employees supervisor the director of sales and marketing indicating that the employee had accommodated some of the market timers by allowing them to trade in other international mutual funds that had not agreed to provide timing capacity the message concluded as follows since our intl international funds are sensitive its been a bit of a juggle inviva profited from annuity contract owners market timing  inviva and jefferson national earned fees on the monument and advantage plus products while they were allowing market timing inviva earned approximately  million in fees during the transition period from october   through april   and approximately  million during the period from may   through november   dilution caused by the market timing activity  as a result of the market timing activity in monument and advantage plus variable annuities the value of annuitants investments was diluted violations  as a result of the conduct described above respondents willfully violated section a of the securities act and section b of the exchange act and rule b thereunder in that respondents made untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading specifically the monument and advantage plus prospectuses falsely stated that these products were not designed for professional market timing organizations and gave the misleading impression that respondents would act independently to monitor or block detrimental trades further monument and advantage plus prospectuses failed to disclose that jefferson national was selling the products to market timers that jefferson national was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy and the risk that the market timers rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers investment returns  as a result of the conduct described above respondents willfully violated section b of the investment company act in that they made an untrue statement of material fact in a registration statement application report account record or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to the investment company act or omitted to state therein any fact necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made from being materially misleading specifically respondents filed registration statements with the commission containing prospectuses that falsely stated that these products were not designed for professional market timing organizations and gave the misleading impression that respondents would act independently to monitor or block detrimental trades further monument and advantage plus prospectuses failed to disclose that jefferson national was selling the products to market timers that jefferson national was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy and the risk
