ago we started an online store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the sport as much as us we could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces but we wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers along with selling our goods such a tool didn’t exist so we built it for ourselves we soon realized a number of other stores were in need of a hasslefree platform to build their retail business and shopify was born we focus on making commerce better for everyone so businesses can focus on what they do best building and selling their products today merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their business — from products to orders to customers selling online in retail stores and on the go  active shopify stores  billion worth of sales weve grown a lot since we started shopify in  from a team of  working out of a local coffee shop to a team of over  working in  offices across north america we’re really proud of our success and growth and we’ve worked hard to nurture our company values and culture we encourage everyone to experiment take risks and push the envelope the opportunity to shape how retail works is in our hands over the coming years the way purchasing works will change at a fundamental level customers will expect options of where and how to buy instore or online delivered or for pickup it’s an incredibly exciting time for this industry and we’re going to be right at the centre of it career opportunities we’re growing and we’re looking for talented people who can make commerce better join our team
