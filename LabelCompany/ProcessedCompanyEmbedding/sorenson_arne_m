international plans to relocate its headquarters from its sprawling bethesda campus in coming years chief executive arne m sorenson said last week prompting what could be a highstakes battle for the prominent corporate nameplate among local jurisdictions a little more than  people work at marriott’s corporate headquarters located in over  square square feet on fernwood road in bethesda sorenson said last week that the global icon would be relocating within the region and that he had begun informally discussing the company’s options with local leaders marriott’s lease expires in  “it’s time to start thinking about it” sorenson said “we’ve got almost a million square feet in bethesda obviously you can’t decide one month you’re going to move one million square feet worth of office and move the next month this is something that’s going to take some years to get worked out” sorenson said he considered the washington area the hospitality capital of the world with competitors hilton worldwide choice hotels diamondrock hospitality and other firms in close proximity he praised the area’s “supremely welleducated workforce” but said in order to attract the best talent he needed a location that would appeal to young workers “i think it’s essential we be accessible to metro and that limits the options i think as with many other things our younger folks are more inclined to be metroaccessible and more urban that doesn’t necessarily mean we will move to downtown washington but we will move someplace” marriott is currently housed in a suburban office park the center of which was built in  and the likes of which some companies have been vacating in recent years during a rush back into urban areas though it is located near interstate  and the capital beltway the complex is about three miles from the nearest metro stop the grosvenor station sorenson  the first nonmember of the marriott family to run the company would not commit to remaining in maryland he said had already had informal discussions with virginia gov terry mcauliffe d and dc officials about his interest in relocating he gave a mixed review of the maryland business climate “maryland has not been great for business but it hasn’t been aggressively trying to run them out” sorenson said “i think it’s more just in the last few years the state probably hasn’t cared about it i don’t think it’s been against it” arne m sorenson chief executive of marriott international photographer simon dawsonbloomberg keeping the company may constitute a first major test for new maryland gov larry hogan r who made waves on the campaign trail about the fact that his state is no longer home to many fortune  companies there are currently only four as previously maryland entries including black  decker coventry health care and constellation new energy have been acquired or merged with companies headquartered elsewhere another major employer mccormick  co maker of old bay seasoning is also mulling a relocation  “we’ve had the largest mass exodus of taxpayers fleeing our state of any state in our region and one of the worst in the nation” hogan said during his first state of the state address in february state officials are working to make sure the company remains said karen glenn hood a spokeswoman for the state department of business and economic development “obviously marriott’s an iconic company it’s a worldclass company and we have a great relationship with them we are engaged with them on a regular basis and it’s a company that we clearly want to continue to call maryland home so we are going to work with them and make sure that happens” she said sally sternbach acting director of the montgomery county department of economic development said the county was taking a “very thoughtful and very thorough look at what will help them to grow and succeed” “accessibility is important and amenities are important and yes we will try to work with them on both and put them where they feel they will get a good return for that” she said spokespeople for mcauliffe and dc mayor muriel e bowser d declined comment marriott’s headquarters have been in montgomery county since  but if its proposed relocation prompts something of a bidding war among local jurisdictions it will not be the first time  in  the company flirted with a move to fairfax county before maryland put up an incentive package worth as much as  million depending on an array of circumstances marriott has been a darling of the stock market during the past two years and increased its fourth quarter earnings by  percent last year it posted  profits of  million or  per share on revenue of  billion sorenson expects it will have  million rooms open or in development by later this year in all the state said
