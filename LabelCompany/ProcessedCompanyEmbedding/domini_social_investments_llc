seventh straight quarter with the sp  returning  plunging oil prices and a more muddied political and economic outlook were not enough to derail market momentum as the sp hit a series of new record highs in a welltelegraphed move the federal reserve bank hiked rates by another  basis points and laid out a plan for balance sheet normalization later this year provided the economy improves as expected the economic picture this quarter though was somewhat more mixed the final estimate for firstquarter gdp growth was revised higher driven by increased spending on health care financial services and insurance while the manufacturing index ticked up on new orders and consumer confidence rose above expectations due to the solid job market and rising stock and home prices payroll and housing data reports however disappointed and a tickdown in the unemployment rate was mostly due to a drop in the size of the labor force on the political front controversy surrounding the white house and the ongoing russia investigation continued to escalate while senate republicans again delayed a vote on their controversial health care reform bill after failing to garner significant support by the end of the quarter volatility picked up in the us equity market as investors rotated out of growth and momentum stocks and back into cyclical and value plays   fund performance the fund’s investor shares returned  for the quarter underperforming the sp  index return of  security selection was the largest driver of underperformance particularly within the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors as well as industrials and financials this was slightly offset by a benefit from being underweight to energy which was one of the worst performing sectors this quarter top relative contributors company sector stock return quest diagnostics inc health care  general electric co industrials  cummins inc industrials  att inc telecommunication services  edwards lifesciences corp

information technology  walgreens boots alliance inc consumer staples  represents return for period in the funds portfolio or return for the entire period if not held not held in the portfolio   for both the fund and the index health care was the best performing sector this quarter lifted by positive trial data and increased merger and acquisition rumors as well as speculation that an upcoming executive order on drug pricing could benefit pharmaceutical companies the largest positive contributor to the fund’s relative performance was diagnostic information services company quest diagnostics which returned almost  for the quarter quest reported betterthanexpected earnings for the twelfth straight quarter with solid organic volume growth led by recovery in healthcare utilization quests partnerships with hospitals are showing traction boosting volumes to the highest level in two years the company is well positioned to gain share from hospitalbased labs in the longterm as it continues to sign new partnerships meanwhile its retail business is also ramping up with the company set to add more than a hundred new safeway stores which will eventually replace quest’s existing patient service centers and should provide numerous costreduction opportunities medical equipment company edwards lifesciences was another top contributor from the health care sector returning almost  for the quarter edwards rose to sixmonth highs after reporting betterthanexpected results for the first quarter driven by strong us sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves and lifting annual sales guidance another top contributor to relative performance was truck engine manufacturer cummins which returned more than  for the quarter after reporting firstquarter earnings  higher than the first quarter last year far surpassing expectations stronger industrial demand from construction and mining is offsetting weaker demand from truck production in north america while international sales benefitted from growth in china and europe cummins highlighted an initiative for automated transmissions that will be fully integrated into its engine production and is expected to deliver up to a  improvement in fuel economy relative performance was also helped by the fund not holding general electric which is not approved for investment by the domini funds due to its involvement with the weapons industry and nuclear power plants and by having an underweight position in att both companies declined more than  for the quarter att reported lowerthanexpected first quarter results driven by weaker consumer net additions for wireless services but partially offset by stronger broadband results the stock fell on news of att’s planned acquisition with time warner which would be its second large acquisition in three years the acquisition would further increase net debt and weaken its credit metrics these positive contributions to the fund’s relative performance were more than offset by a number of significant detractors the two largest individual detractors this quarter were retailers foot locker and ross stores which declined more than  and  respectively shoe and apparel retailer foot locker after having already lowered its previously issued guidance reported firstquarter results that came in below diminished expectations despite the company’s long history of tight inventory control and spending discipline it is facing a significant structural challenge due to having a large number of brickandmortar stores in a declining mall environment discount home and apparel retailer ross stores declined along with other retailers this quarter despite bucking the retail trend by reporting strongerthanexpected results for the first quarter driven by strong store traffic and average basket size the next largest detractors were in the information technology sector application services software company f networks declined almost  for the quarter after reporting quarterly results that missed consensus estimates driven by weakness in european sales and flat growth in services f is facing shortterm headwinds from delayed purchase decisions attributed to a transition from physical to virtual applicationdelivery controllers customer hesitance in moving to the cloud and political uncertainty in europe ibm also declined almost  after quarterly sales fell short of estimates this marked its th consecutive quarter of revenue declines ibm is similarly experiencing delays in service contracts and weakness in european markets while its investments in highgrowth areas have yet to generate sufficient sales to offset declines in legacy businesses walgreens boots alliance the holding company for walgreens pharmacy was another significant detractor declining more than  for the quarter
