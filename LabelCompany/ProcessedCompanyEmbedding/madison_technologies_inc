of operation for the period ended december   during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred net losses of  compared to our net losses in fiscal  of  our losses in the current fiscal year were slightly lower due to lower general and administrative expenses that we incurred in connection with our preparation and filings we have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to complete our proposed business plan for these reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation liquidity and capital resources as of december   madison had total assets of  and a working capital deficit of  compared with a working capital deficit of  as of december   the increase in the working capital deficit was primarily due to an increase in interest accrued on notes payable debt the balance owing on the license agreement and an increase in convertible notes payable arising from interest recognition on discount the assets consisted of  in cash and  in a license agreement the liabilities consisted of  in accounts payable  in   in notes payable and accrued interest  in   in convertible notes payable  in   in license fee payable and  due to a related party there are no assurances that madison will be able to achieve further sales of its common stock or any other form of additional financing if madison is unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations then madison will not be able to continue its plan of operations and its business will fail net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended december   net cash used in operating activities increased to  compared with  for the same period in the previous fiscal year the use of cash was primarily due to a net loss of  less a non cash items of interest on the convertible debt of  of

madisons plan of operation for the next  months is to deliver the licensed products into the european and uk retail and wholesale markets via the use of online market and fulfilment services including but not limited to amazoneu redstag and mcs fulfilment by implementing these companies services madison will be able to establish a reliable supply chain that will receive delivery of the licensed products warehouse the licensed products package the licensed package as per each customer order and ship the licensed products to the customer efficiently and cost effectively madison technologies inc form k   page  management expects to expand madisons sales distribution strategy beginning in may  and to be operational by september  this includes the following components  initial inventory with an estimated cost of   social media and online advertising of   payments to be made under product license agreement of  madison sales strategy is to develop online exposure through the use of social media marketing and sending demo packs of the licensed products to both online bloggers and established gun owner clubs the demo packs will include both new products as well as examples of the products that have been tested and exposed to gunfire to demonstrate the products effectiveness in addition to the costs associated to madisons sales and distribution strategy management anticipates incurring the following expenses during the next  month period  management anticipates spending approximately  in ongoing general and administrative expenses per month for the next  months for a total anticipated expenditure of  over the next  months the general and administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to madisons regulatory filings throughout the year as well as transfer agent fees annual mineral claim fees and general office expenses  management anticipates spending approximately  in complying with madisons obligations as a reporting company under the securities exchange act of  and as a reporting issuer in canada these expenses will consist primarily of professional fees relating to the preparation of madisons financial statements and completing and filing its annual report quarterly report and current report filings with the sec and with sedar in canada as at december   madison had cash of  and a working capital deficit of  accordingly madison will require additional financing in the amount of  in order to fund its obligations as a reporting company under the securities act of  and its general and administrative expenses for the next  months during the  month period following the date of this annual report management anticipates that madison will not generate any revenue accordingly madison will be required to obtain additional financing in order to continue its plan of operations management believes that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding madisons plan of operations as it does not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing rather management anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of madisons common stock however madison does not have any financing arranged and cannot provide investors with any assurance that it will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of its common stock to fund its plan of operations in the absence of such financing madison will not be able to acquire any interest in a new technology and its business plan will fail even if madison is successful in obtaining equity financing and acquire an interest in a new technology additional research and development will be required before a determination as to whether the technology will be commercially viable if madison does not continue to obtain additional financing it will be forced to abandon its business and plan of operations purchase of significant equipment we do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next  months offbalance sheet arrangements madison has no offbalance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect its liquidity capital resources market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits material commitments for capital expenditures madison had no contingencies or longterm commitments at december   madison technologies inc form k   page  going concern the independent auditors report accompanying our december   and  financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business tabular disclosure of contractual obligations madison is a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the exchange act and is not required to provide the information required under this item critical accounting policies madisons financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies management believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of madisons financial statements is critical to an understanding of madisons financial statements use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period madison regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances madison bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by madison may differ materially and adversely from madisons estimates to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected fair value measurements madison follows fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures for all financial instruments and nonfinancial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis this new accounting standard establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements it does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value madison defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value madison considers the principal or most advantageous market in which madison would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and credit risk madison has adopted fasb asc  financial instruments which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value madison has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments impairment of longlived assets impairment losses on longlived assets such as mining claims are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than their carrying value and accordingly all or a portion of such carrying value may not be recoverable impairment losses are then measured by comparing the fair value of assets to their carrying amounts mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all
