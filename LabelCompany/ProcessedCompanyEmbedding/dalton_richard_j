remanded by published opinion judge michael wrote the opinion in which judge williams and judge motz joined opinion michael circuit judge capital associated industries inc cai erroneously reported to richard daltons prospective employer that he had been convicted of felony assault dalton sued cai and three of its employees under the fair credit reporting act fcra  usc ss eb and k for following inadequate procedures in reporting his criminal history dalton also asserted several state law claims against the defendants the district court threw out all of daltons claims with some dismissed under rule b  and some disposed of on summary judgment under rule  this appeal deals only with the summary judgment and focuses mainly on whether there are triable issues on daltons claims that cais failure to follow fcramandated procedures led it to issue a false report on his criminal record we vacate the award of summary judgment to cai on daltons fcra claims because he has proffered evidence that reveals disputed issues of material fact we affirm the grant of summary judgment on all other claims because dalton was the nonmovant in the summary judgment proceedings we recite the facts in the light most favorable to him drawing all justifiable inferences in his favor see anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    in early may  dalton had a job interview with sumitomo electric lightwave corp sumitomo at its offices in research triangle park north carolina dalton who was seeking the position of west coast regional sales manager filled out an employment application during his visit with the company the application form asked whether dalton had been convicted of a felony in the past seven years in  dalton was charged in colorado with second degree assault a felony but he ultimately pled guilty to third degree assault a misdemeanor accordingly he truthfully stated on the application that he had not been convicted of a felony at the end of the interview sumitomo offered dalton the sales manager position contingent upon    successful completion of educational employment and criminal background investigations to conduct the criminal background check on dalton sumitomo engaged cai a north carolinabased employers association that provides a variety of services for its members including background investigations on job applicants sumitomo specifically asked cai to investigate whether dalton had a criminal record anywhere in the denver colorado area where dalton had lived until shortly before his interview cai did not perform the criminal records investigation itself rather it engaged safehands inc to perform the task cai had been using safehands to do criminal background investigations for about a year and had found the firm to be reliable but safehands did not perform the dalton check either safehands hired guaranty research services inc grs grs from its own offices ran a statewide computer search of criminal records for all colorado counties this search revealed that dalton had a criminal record in jefferson county because the computer database did not reveal the nature of the charge a grs employee called the jefferson county clerks office a clerk told the grs employee that dalton had been convicted of third degree assault which the clerk erroneously said was a felony grs sent this information that dalton had been convicted of a felony third degree assault to safehands without taking any steps to verify its accuracy safehands in turn sent it to cai which delivered it to sumitomo neither cai nor safehands took any independent steps to verify the substance of grss criminal history report on dalton while sumitomo was waiting for the results of the criminal records check it proceeded to verify daltons employment history sumitomo discovered that he had significantly misstated his periods of employment with two prior employers dalton reported on his application that he had worked for fiber optic network solutions from january  through january  in fact he had worked for that firm from june  through december  dalton reported that he had worked for telect inc from  through  but in fact he had only worked there from february  through december  based upon the results of the criminal and employment background checks sumitomo decided to withdraw its offer to dalton pending further investigation on may   a sumitomo representative called dalton informing him that the offer was being withdrawn because he had been convicted of a felony the representative did not mention the inaccurate employment history appearing in daltons application dalton denied that he had been convicted of a felony and the representative promised to call cai to confirm the accuracy of the criminal records check the sumitomo representative called dalton back a halfhour later and told him that cai was standing by its report that he had a felony conviction cai nevertheless began to reinvestigate whether dalton was a convicted felon the next day may   dalton called cai directly to challenge the accuracy of its records check cai claims that by the time dalton called it had discovered that he was not a convicted felon according to cai it told dalton during this conversation that it had made a mistake dalton on the other hand claims that cai told him that it was standing by its report regardless sometime that day cai discovered its mistake and contacted sumitomo to correct the initial report wayne lehto a cai representative called the jefferson county colorado clerks office the clerk who answered the telephone told lehto that dalton had been convicted of third degree assault which the clerk said was a felony however when lehto pressed the clerk about whether third degree assault was really a felony the clerk transferred lehto to another court clerk the second clerk informed lehto correctly that third degree assault was a misdemeanor not a felony lehto telephoned sumitomo immediately advising the company that cai had made a mistake and that dalton had only been convicted of a misdemeanor according to dalton no one from sumitomo or cai ever told him that the mistake had been corrected sumitomo spent the next few weeks reevaluating daltons employment application a company representative again contacted daltons previous employers this time for recommendations two of these prior employers said that they would not rehire dalton a sumitomo human resources manager called dalton about the inaccuracies in his employment history according to the manager he asked dalton on two separate occasions to provide sumitomo with a written explanation of the discrepancies dalton did not respond because he failed to submit a written explanation sumitomo decided not to consider him any further for the regional sales manager position on june   sumitomo wrote dalton as follows based on the discrepancies in your background check and the length of time it is taking for you to provide clarifying information we will no longer consider you as a candidate for employment sumitomo eventually hired another person to fill the job dalton sued cai and three of its employees claiming that they violated fcra committed libel per se intentionally interfered with his prospective economic advantage and violated the north carolina unfair trade practices act utpa the district court dismissed daltons utpa claim and his fcra claims against the three employees of cai later the district court granted summary judgment to cai on daltons fcra claims and summary judgment to all four defendants on daltons claims for libel and interference with prospective economic advantage dalton appeals the summary judgment order but not the order dismissing his utpa claim or his fcra claims against the individual defendants we review the district courts grant of summary judgment de novo see higgins v ei dupont de nemours  co  fd   th cir  congress enacted fcra in  out of concerns about abuses in the consumer reporting industry see s rep no  at    cong rec   statement of sen proxmire id at  statement of rep sullivan see also guimond v trans union credit info co  fd   th cir  st paul guardian ins co v johnson  fd   th cir  hovater v equifax inc  fd   th cir  employers were placing increasing reliance on consumer reporting agencies to obtain information on the backgrounds of prospective employees congress found that in too many instances agencies were reporting inaccurate information that was adversely affecting the ability of individuals to obtain employment as representative sullivan remarked with the trend toward    the establishment of all sorts of computerized data banks the individual is in great danger of having his life and character reduced to impersonal blips and keypunch holes in a stolid and unthinking machine which can literally ruin his reputation without cause and make him unemployable  cong rec   in enacting fcra congress adopted a variety of measures designed to insure that agencies report accurate information two of these measures  usc ss eb ands k deal with the procedures consumer reporting agencies must follow when collecting and transmitting information congress also gave individuals the right to sue reporting agencies for violations of fcra id ss n o cai is a consumer reporting agency that is subject to fcra dalton claims that cai used inadequate procedures in reporting about his criminal history in violation of ss eb and k in considering daltons argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to cai on his fcra claims we take up three issues first whether there is a material factual dispute concerning daltons claims that cai violated its duties under ss eb and k second whether dalton has proffered sufficient evidence to show that cais violations were either negligent or willful and third whether we may affirm cais summary judgment on the alternative ground not relied upon by the district court that dalton has not suffered any damages due to cais actions daltons first fcra claim is that cai followed unreasonable procedures in violation of s eb when it prepared the report for sumitomo about his criminal history section eb provides that  whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates thus a consumer reporting agency violates s eb if  the consumer report contains inaccurate information and  the reporting agency did not follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy see eg guimond  fd at  cahlin v gen motors acceptance corp  fd   th cir  stewart v credit bureau inc  fd   dc cir  the district court concluded that cais report to sumitomo contained accurate information about daltons criminal record and that cai used reasonable procedures in preparing the report the current record does not support these conclusions cai claimed in its motion for summary judgment and the district court agreed that cai reported accurate information dalton however proffered specific facts that create a triable issue of fact on the question of accuracy to make out a violation under s eb a consumer must present evidence tending to show that a credit reporting agency prepared a report containing inaccurate information guimond  fd at  see also washington v csc credit servs inc  fd   n th cir  philbin v trans union corp  fd   d cir  spence v trw inc  fd   th cir  henson v csc credit servs  fd   th cir  cahlin  fd at  koropoulos v credit bureau inc  fd   dc cir  a report is inaccurate when it is patently incorrect or when it is misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to have an adverse   effect sepulvado v csc credit servs  fd   th cir  the accuracy issue in this case turns on whether cais report indicates that dalton had been convicted of a felony cais report stated that the following record about dalton was found to be on file in the clerks office in jefferson county colorado f  felony third degree assault  guilty  days suspended sentence  days jail sentence  years probation cai argues that the report is accurate because it does not explicitly state that dalton was guilty of a felony however a reasonable jury could read the report as plainly indicating that dalton was found guilty of a felony third degree assault third degree assault is actually a misdemeanor in colorado the report gives no indication that dalton pled guilty to a crime that was different from the felony that was charged if a jury concludes as it reasonably could that the report indicates that dalton was guilty of a felony inaccuracy would be established because it is undisputed that dalton pled guilty to a misdemeanor in short the evidence in the summary judgment record is sufficient to create a triable issue on the accuracy of the report we next consider whether the district court erred in concluding that cai follow ed reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information about dalton as required by s eb we note first that the circuits appear to be split on who bears the burden of proof on this issue specifically must the plaintiff show that the reporting agency did not follow reasonable procedures or must the agency show that it did compare stewart  fd at   n holding that plaintiff bears the burden with guimond  fd at  suggesting that consumer reporting agency bears the burden cahlin  fd at  same nothing in the statute suggests that a plaintiff is relieved of the burden of showing that the agency failed to follow reasonable procedures see eg edison v dept of army  fd   th cir  applying thetraditional rule imposing the burden of proof on the plaintiff when the statute is silent as to who bears the burden indeed s eb stands in contrast to two other fcra sections in which congress explicitly places the burden on the consumer reporting agency to show the reasonableness of its procedures when it seeks to avail itself of liability exemption provisions see ss dc mc see also stewart  fd at  n concluding that these sections show that congress knew how to shift the burden from plaintiff to the consumer reporting agency therefore we hold that the plaintiff bears the burden under s eb to show that the consumer reporting agency did not follow reasonable procedures  the issue of whether the agency failed to followreasonable procedures will be a jury question   in the overwhelming majority of cases guimond  fd at  see also andrews v trw inc  fd   th cir  it would normally not be easy for a court as a matter of law to determine whether a given procedure was reasonable in reaching the very high standard set by the statute     cf also stewart  fd at  stating that a plaintiff need only minimally present some evidence of unreasonableness this case is easily grouped within the overwhelming majority of cases guimond  fd at  specifically dalton has created a dispute of material fact as to whether cai followed unreasonable procedures by failing to instruct its subvendors on the proper sources of criminal history information cai engaged safehands which in turn engaged grs after grs discovered through its own computer search that dalton had a criminal record in jefferson county colorado it called the clerks office there the record suggests that grs did not simply rely on the clerk to read information from daltons case file or from the clerks computer database see henson v csc credit servs  fd   th cir  holding that reliance on actual court records constitutes a reasonable procedure instead the inference is that the clerk read from the computer database that dalton had been convicted of third degree assault but then offered his or her own legal opinion that third degree assault is a felony under colorado law cai had no procedures governing the sources that a subvendor could rely upon in collecting information for a criminal background report a jury could properly conclude that it was an unreasonable procedure to rely on a clerks informal opinion on the crucial question of whether a specific crime is a felony and that cai should have had procedures in place to instruct its subvendors on the appropriate sources for reliable information about a persons criminal record accordingly the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of cai on the issue of whether it failed to follow reasonable procedures daltons second fcra claim is that cai violateds k section k deals with consumer reports in the employment context section eb which we just discussed regulates the preparation of consumer reports in general section k creates heightened standards for procedures used to collect information for employment purposes to fall within this section the consumer report must contain matters of public record that are likely to have an adverse effect upon a consumers ability to obtain employment id s k when a consumer reporting agency furnishes such a report it is obligated to do one of two things the agency must either notify the consumer at the time the report is transmitted to the user or maintain strict procedures designed to ensure that the information    is complete and up to date id s k  cai concedes that its report of daltons criminal history information falls within this section cai further concedes that it did not notify dalton at the time it reported his criminal history information to sumitomo the issue then is whether there is a disputed issue of fact over whether cai maintainedstrict procedures to ensure that daltons criminal record was complete and up to date because as we held above there is a factual dispute over whether cai followed reasonable procedures we necessarily hold that there is a factual dispute over whether it followed strict procedures we leave for another day the determination of what constitutes strict as opposed to reasonable procedures see equifax v ftc  fd   n th cir  noting that the distinction between strict and reasonable procedures is clearly not without significance obabueski v ibm corp  f supp d   sdny  same for these reasons we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to cai on the issue of whether cai followed strict procedures dalton argues that the district court erred in its conclusion that  even assuming cai violated the provisions of fcra there is no liability because cai did not act either willfully or negligently fcra does not impose strict liability on consumer reporting agencies for inaccuracies in reporting instead fcra imposes liability for negligent noncompliance with the act and it allows for enhanced penalties for willful violations see  usc ss n o here dalton has proffered evidence to show that cai was negligent but not willful in failing to follow required procedures a showing of malice or evil motive is not required to prove willfulness under the act see eg stevenson v trw inc  fd   th cir  yohay v city of alexandria employees credit union  fd   th cir  the plaintiff must only show that the defendant knowingly and intentionally committed an act in conscious disregard for the rights of the consumer pinner v schmidt  fd   th cir  see also stevenson  fd at  yohay  fd at  even though summary judgment is seldom appropriate on whether a party possessed a particular state of mind evidence that cai acted willfully is wholly lacking see magill v gulf  w indus inc  fd   th cir  dalton has not shown for example that cai was aware that its subvendors relied upon informal legal opinions from court clerks there is no evidence that other consumers have lodged complaints similar to daltons against cai indeed cai had used safehands for about a year and had found the firm to be reliable further cai corrected its mistake one day after dalton challenged the accuracy of the report accordingly no reasonable jury could conclude that cai acted willfully in violating ss eb or k nevertheless a jury could properly conclude that cai acted negligently cai had no procedures in place to instruct its subvendors on the appropriate sources for reliable information on criminal records a reasonable jury could conclude that cais failure to have such procedures was a negligent violation of fcra cai argues that we may affirm its award of summary judgment on daltons fcra claims on the ground that dalton cannot show that he suffered damages due to any action by cai the district court did not rely on this ground however in dismissing daltons interference with prospective economic advantage claim the court concluded that plaintiffs alleged injury ie not obtaining employment with sumitomo did not result from defendants actions cai argues that this same analysis applies to daltons fcra claims we agree with the district court that dalton cannot show that cais false report played a role in sumitomos decision not to hire him for the position cai promptly corrected its mistake informing sumitomo that dalton had not been convicted of a felony sumitomo then continued to consider dalton for the sales manager position sumitomo ultimately decided not to hire him because he failed to submit a written explanation on the inaccuracies in his application relating to his employment history even though cais false report is not what prevented dalton from getting a job with sumitomo we are hesitant to say that the district court necessarily would have concluded that dalton could not show that cai caused him any damages on his fcra claims on his interference claim dalton had to show that damages arose out of sumitomos decision to terminate relations with him see eg burgess v busby  sed   nc ct app  on his fcra claims dalton need only show that he suffered damages from the false report regardless of how sumitomo reacted to the report specifically dalton alleges that he suffered emotional distress and loss of reputation as a result of the false report damages for such injuries are recoverable under fcra see cousin v trans union corp  fd   n th cir  bakker v mckinnon  fd   th cir  guimond  fd at  zamora v valley fed savs  loan assn  fd   th cir  we decline to affirm the award of summary judgment on the fcra claims against cai on the alternative ground not considered by the district court that dalton cannot prove any damages whatsoever nevertheless the question of whether dalton can prove damages for emotional distress or loss of reputation under his fcra claims may be considered in summary judgment proceedings on remand if the appropriate motion is made for the foregoing reasons we vacate the grant of summary judgment to cai on daltons claims under ss eb and k of fcra dalton also appeals the award of summary judgment to cai and the three individual defendants on his state law claims for libel and interference with prospective economic advantage after considering the briefs the joint appendix and the oral arguments of counsel we rely substantially on the reasoning of the district court to affirm the summary judgment for the defendants on these two claims see dalton v capital associated indus inc no cvbr at  ednc sept   we vacate the judgment insofar as it awards summary judgment to cai on daltons fcra claims and we remand for further proceedings on those claims the judgment is otherwise affirmed affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded   we express no view as to whether an inaccuracy can be so egregious that it creates a presumption that the agencys procedures were unreasonable see philbin  fd at
