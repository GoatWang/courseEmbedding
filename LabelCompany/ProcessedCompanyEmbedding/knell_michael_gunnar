world of infinite possibility visually connected to computers tablets phones and games peering into an abyss of highenergy visible hev artificial blue light for hours can disrupt your entire system your eyes neck and back circadian rhythms serotonin levels and overall health computer vision syndrome cvs has become an increasing problem nearly  of us adults experience digital eyestrain as a result of increasing use of digital devices cumulative exposure to artificial blue light can contribute to vision problems such as cataracts and agerelated macular degeneration the vision council nearly  of american adults experience some form of digital eye strain due to prolonged use of electronic devices percent the solution gunnar patented lens technology gunnar is the only patented computer eyewear recommended by doctors to protect and enhance your vision patented lens technology gunnar offers the only patented computer lens technology solution recommended by doctors to protect and enhance your vision our custom and complete solution addresses and alleviates all common issues associated with digital eye strain effects of artificial blue light visual stress and fatigue as the world leader in computer eyewear gunnar pioneered an advanced lens material that offers distortionfree ultralight ergonomic properties not found in inferior lens material our proprietary lens design aids natural focusing to provide sharper clearer vision resulting in less strain on ciliary muscles and frame your face to reduce effects of dry eye in addition custom tints and premium coatings block highenergy artificial blue light ultraviolet uv light and glare to protect your vision the result – improved clarity focus and performance designed to meet demanding visual needs of our generation prescription rx eyeglasses are available for anyone who requires corrective lenses lens design our patented lens design is highly wrapped to limit air currents near the eyes increasing humidity and preventing irritation unlike many traditional prescription eyeglasses this design enhances focus and sharpens detail to ease eyestrain the science individual blink rate is decreased by approximately  when using a computer or doing neardistance work consequently protective tear film layers are replenished less frequently leaving eyes irritated dry and exposed to environmental damage longterm effects may include abrasion erosion and scarring of the cornea our highly wrapped frame limits air currents and increases humidity to form a protective barrier around the eye continuous flexion of ciliary muscles during long periods of neardistance viewing can cause blurred vision difficulty focusing double vision and eyestrain our lens design prefocuses the light allowing ciliary muscles to relax while details appear sharper the benefit dry eyes can cause irritation and impair normal visual function gunnars increase humidity levels and reduce muscular strain resulting in eyes that are refreshed protected and able to function more comfortably and efficiently lens material gunnar lens material eliminates distortion from impurities and haze found in inferior materials to ensure the clearest image possible the ultralight yet durable performance optics will not degrade over time the science traditional lens materials compromise on clarity color control durability and impact resistance gunnar lens material is the only optical lens that optimizes durability and impact resistance while maintaining the highest degree of clarity and color control with minimal haze and ultrasharp optics lenses appear crystal clear the high degree of color control within the lenses also enables gunnars to handle engineered tints and bandpass filters properly with no birefringence or edge effects found in inferior lens materials the benefit highly durable material creates stable optics that won’t permanently deform when flexed or degrade over time through repeated use our ultralight lens materials offer an optically pure viewing experience with ergonomic properties that provide • low density with lighter lenses • higher light transmission rate that enhances clarity • higher abbe value for distortionfree viewing • medium index of refraction  allows for thinner lenses than cr lens tints gunnars custom lens tints filter blue light and block uv light to enhance contrast and protect eyes the filtered spectrum replicates natural light minimizing visual stress the science artificial light from energyefficient computers and overhead fluorescent lighting consists of narrow bands of highenergy light instead of the equally balanced fullspectrum the human eye prefers changing the color of your screen or brightness does not affect the quality of the digital light gunnar lens tints filter and balance the transmitted spectrum reducing highenergy visible hev light and warming the overall view with harsh blue light reduced sensitive parts of the eye are engaged increasing perceived contrast filtering blue light from a backlit screen reduces visual recovery time and protects the eyes “after image” effects the benefit our custom tints tune artificial blue light to enhance the physiology of the naked eye increasing contrast perception and shifting the color spectrum for visual efficiency tint options the gunnar signature amber lens tint offers the best enhancement of contrast and visual performance while minimizing screen glare and diminishing the harshest parts of the color spectrum our crystalline lens and coating formula is designed specifically for graphic designers videofilm editors and creative visual artists who require an equally balanced color spectrum if your profession requires you to work in true color then this lens option is for you our nonpolarized outdoor tint creates a more comfortable and rich visual experience for anyone viewing digital devices outdoors lens coatings gunnar lens coatings reduce glare and reflective light to eliminate visual distraction and stress an external hard coat provides extended lens durability and resists scratches the science gunnar lens coatings have antireflective properties that reduce peripheral reflections and glare without distracting reflections eyes can focus more efficiently while some eyewear may have antireflective properties on the front portion of the lens reflected light from the eye itself can be distracting on the inside of the lens gunnar uses the antireflection coating on both sides of the lens for a clear view an external hard coat makes gunnar eyewear extremely durable lowquality lenses can degrade over time due to the buildup of hazeinducing oils and surface abrasions and damage from usage lowers optical performance gunnar lens coatings have an outer protective hard coat to resist scratches and maintain optical integrity over time additional treatments prevent oil buildup from penetrating the lens material and promote easy cleaning and care the benefit reducing external sources of visual light and glare minimizes the amount of work your eyes perform to focus on a task gunnar’s lens coatings optimize the environment by eliminating visual noise the protective outer layer also provides lasting durability and lens performance over time the effects of blue light we are visually connected to computers tablets phones and games peering into the digital world for hours can disrupt our entire system as digital device use increases more and more people suffer from digital eyestrain symptoms one cause of this is believed to be the blue light emitted from the displays of such devices light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that carries energy the shorter the wavelength the stronger energy because blue light has the shortest wavelength in the visible light spectrum it carries the highest amount of energy recent evidence suggests that blue light causes more damage to the retina in particular with the development of agerelated macular degeneration which is the third leading cause of blindness worldwide blue light in particular at the nm point is hard on the eyes for several reasons this is the area that digital devices produce and this blue light is the only light that penetrates the eye all the way to the back to the retina  blue light between  and nm is considered bad blue light because it can cause accumulated damage to the retina cause cataracts and is linked to sleep disorders all blue light is not bad though although blue light between  and nm is considered bad blue light from  to nm is generally considered good for you this range of visible blue light is beneficial because it provides natural reflexes protecting eyes from light overexposure helps with the body’s circadian rhythms and helps cognitive and memory function other blue light blocking lens solutions only add coatings on the lens surface to reduce the amount of blue light that passes through the lens and into your eye this has a very limited effect and only blocks about  to  of the harmful blue light gunnar lenses are carefully formulated to filter and balance light while absorbing  of hev blue light emitted from digital devices by designing our lenses to shift the color spectrum for visual efficiency the gunnar amber lens takes artificial light and precisely tunes it to the physiology of the eye initial research into the adverse effects of blue light on patients who suffer from post concussion syndrome has shown that wearing gunnars can help reduce symptoms such as headaches vertigo difficulty concentrating and light sensitivity in addition gunnar optiks has recently been receiving a growing number of claims from concussion sufferers that our eyewear has helped here is the study that was published in the journal of athletic training northwestern university recently studied how artificial blue light affects the body’s metabolism and ability to produce insulin knowing past findings have shown that blue light triggers certain chemicals in the brain researchers discovered that exposure to blue light not only adversely affected metabolism but also increased insulin resistance ultimately blue light can potentially lead to weight gain and even increase risk of diabetes the full study has since been published on the scientifically rigorous research and open access journal site plos one the lens difference
