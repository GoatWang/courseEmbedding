develops and plans to commercialize innovative personalized therapeutics for patients with genetically defined cancers we systematically identify the genetic alterations that create cancer causing genes called oncogenes select patients in whom the identified genetic alteration is found and then design small molecule therapeutics to inhibit the oncogene the clinical development plan for each of
