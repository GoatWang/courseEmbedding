’s while stuck on a screenplay he wanted to codify the storytelling process—to find the structure powering movies and tv shows i was thinking there must be some symmetry to this harmon says some simplicity  while working on channel  harmon found that many of the directors he was working with claimed that they were unable to write plots for television shows this caused harmon to distill joseph campbells structure of the monomyth into a simple circular eightstep process that would reliably produce coherent stories the story circle supposedly can be applied to all stories harmon uses it whenever hes writing a new story saying i cant not see that circle its tattooed on my brain the circle is divided into eight segments each representing a stage of the plot a character is introduced wants something enters a new environment adapts to that environment achieves their goal but encounters problems as a result leaves that world and changes as a result the steps are as follows  a character is in a zone of comfort or familiarity  they desire something  they enter an unfamiliar situation  they adapt to that situation  they get that which they wanted  they pay a heavy price for it  they return to their familiar situation  they have changed as a result of the journey joseph campbells structure of the monomyth is the main influence in harmons technique in a blog post detailing the second sector of the circle harmon explains the point of this part of the circle is our protagonist has been thrown into the water and now its sink or swim in hero with a thousand faces campbell

an influence on the embryo techniqe as well as the work of syd field harmon states that this circular structure of storytelling can be applied both to film and tv suggesting in a channel  blog that only the final intentions are different a feature film’s job is to send you out of the theatre on a high in  minutes television’s job is to keep you glued to the television for your entire life this

dont wont andor cant think about according to freud there are dirty pictures of your mother down there according to jung there are pipes wires even tunnels down there that connect your home to others and even though it contains lifesustaining energies like the fuse box and water heater its a primitive stinky scary place and its no wonder that given the choice we dont hang out down there however your pleasure your sanity and even your life depend on occasional round trips youve got to change the fuses grab the christmas ornaments clean the litter box to the extent that we keep the basement door sealed the entire home becomes unstable the creatures downstairs get louder and the guy upstairs your ego tries to cover the noise with neurotic behaviour for some eventually the basement door can come right off its hinges and the slimy primal denizens of the deep can become scrabble partners you might call this a nervous breakdown or psychotic break it doesnt matter the point is occasional

simplicity  while working on channel  harmon found that many of the directors he was working with claimed that they were unable to write plots for television shows this caused harmon to distill joseph campbells structure of the monomyth into a simple circular eightstep process that would reliably produce coherent stories the story circle supposedly can be applied to all stories harmon uses it whenever hes writing a new story saying i cant not see that circle its tattooed on my brain the circle is divided into eight segments each representing a stage of the plot a character is introduced

harmon voiced the recurring character of bird person great minds with dan harmon edit since february  harmon has starred as a fictional version of himself in great minds with dan harmon a time travel comedy series on history sirens of titan announced july edit it was announced that kurt vonneguts  novel the sirens of titan would be made into a television series and would be adapted by dan harmon and evan katz story embryo techniqueedit harmons illustrated story technique harmon has invented a storytelling framework referred to as the story embryo he began developing the technique in the late ’s while stuck on a screenplay he wanted to codify the storytelling process—to find the structure powering movies and tv shows i was thinking there must be some symmetry to this harmon says some simplicity  while working on channel  harmon found that many of the directors he was working with claimed that they were unable to write plots for television shows this caused harmon to distill joseph campbells structure of the monomyth into a simple circular eightstep process that would reliably produce coherent stories the story circle supposedly can be applied to all stories harmon uses it whenever hes writing a new story saying i cant not see that circle its tattooed on my brain the circle is divided into eight segments each representing a stage of the plot a character is introduced wants something enters a new environment adapts to that environment achieves their goal but encounters problems as a result leaves that world and changes as a result the steps are as follows  a character is in a zone of comfort or familiarity  they desire something  they enter an unfamiliar situation  they adapt to that situation  they get that which they wanted  they pay a heavy price for it  they return to their familiar situation  they have changed as a result of the journey joseph campbells structure of the monomyth is the main influence in harmons technique in a blog post detailing the second sector of the circle harmon explains the point of this part of the circle is our protagonist has been thrown into the water and now its sink or swim in hero with a thousand faces campbell actually evokes the image of a digestive tract breaking the hero down divesting him of neuroses stripping him of fear and desire theres no room for bullshit in the unconscious basement asthma inhalers eyeglasses credit cards fratty boyfriends promotions toupees and cell phones cant save you here the purpose here has become refreshingly  and frighteningly  simple the monomyth has been adapted for screen and television writing before most notably by former disney developmental executive christopher vogler in his book the writers journey mythic structure for writers harmon has noted this book as an influence on the embryo techniqe as well as the work of syd field harmon states that this circular structure of storytelling can be applied both to film and tv suggesting in a channel  blog that only the final intentions are different a feature film’s job is to send you out of the theatre on a high in  minutes television’s job is to keep you glued to the television for your entire life this doesn’t entail making stories any less circular tv circles are so circular they’re sometimes irritatingly predictable it just means that the focus of step  is less rilingthingsup and more gettingthingsbacktowheretheystarted he sayscitation needed harmon has used the story embryo technique extensively throughout projects such as community and rick and morty in an interview on collidercom writer adam chitwood said the show rick and morty debuted in  to a serious degree of anticipation as it marked a new animated venture for community creator dan harmon but it was the marriage of harmon’s adeptness for structure and character and cocreator justin roilands insanely creativesometimes insane mind that made rick and morty much more than just another animated tv series for adults in a six part series on the channel  wiki harmon broke down the specifics of the technique in this series of blog post harmon also revealed the influence the sigmund freud and carl jung have on the technique saying your mind is a home with an upstairs and a downstairs upstairs in your consciousness things are welllit and regularly swept friends visit scrabble is played hot cocoa is brewing it is a pleasant familiar place downstairs it is older darker and much much freakier we call this basement the unconscious mind the unconscious is exactly what it sounds like its the stuff you dont wont andor cant think about according to freud there are dirty pictures of your mother down there according to jung there are pipes wires even tunnels down there that connect your home to others and even though it contains lifesustaining energies like the fuse box and water heater its a primitive stinky scary place and its no wonder that given the choice we dont hang out down there however your pleasure your sanity and even your life depend on occasional round trips youve got to change the fuses grab the christmas ornaments clean the litter box to the extent that we keep the basement door sealed the entire home becomes unstable the creatures downstairs get louder and the guy upstairs your ego tries to cover the noise with neurotic behaviour for some eventually the basement door can come right off its hinges and the slimy primal denizens of the deep can become scrabble partners you might call this a nervous breakdown or psychotic break it doesnt matter the point is occasional ventures by the ego into the unconscious through therapy meditation confession sex violence or a good story keep the consciousness in working order — story structure  pure boring theory fans and critics have retroactively applied harmons story circle to other shows such as breaking bad harmons technique has been adopted by irish sitcom writer graham linehan the creator of shows such as father ted the it crowd and black books in an interview with the telegraph linehan said whenever i write for television i plan the story on whiteboard wallpaper in my office using a system created by the american writer dan harmon it’s remarkably simple a character wants something they enter a new world and adapt to it they get what they want reenter the old world and change the great thing about it is that once you have an idea for one bit the section opposite comes naturally as do the ones on either side and so on it’s basically a distillation of the ‘hero’s journey’ idea but it’s undetectable and applies to any ideas big or small cameosedit dan harmon appears in a cameo role in episode two in season four of arrested development as the yurt clerk and in funny people as a paparazzo he also has a guest spot as a voice actor in the fox animated television series axe cop his voice also appeared as a disclaimerstyle voiceover in the community finale awardsedit in july  harmon was nominated
