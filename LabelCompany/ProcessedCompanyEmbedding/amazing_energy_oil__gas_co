administration has suggestedthe average production will be  million barrels per day next year the federal agency revealed this week up from  million barrels this year and more than the  million barrels produced in  the landmark yearleading the us production charge will be permian basin operations in western texas and southeastern new mexico and operations in the gulf of mexicothe eia said production in the permian will increase to about  million barrels per day in  as average production ramps up  barrels per day from june  to the end of  that  million barrels represents almost  percent of expected us production next yearspecifically the eia said lower costs of production have enabled permian producers to make a profit even with oil prices lingering in the abarrel range and falling into the mid range in recent weeks baker hughes rig count says there are  onshore rigs in the permian alone there are  onshore rigs in all in the lower  us stateseight projects came online in the gulf

 contributor i write about energy the environment and the economy  opinions expressed by forbes contributors are their own       last week the us geological survey usgs announced the largest estimate of continuous oil that it has ever assessed the area assessed is in the permian basin a region that has been producing oil continuously for nearly  yearsthe permian basin lies underneath western texas and southeastern new mexico the geology of the permian basin is rich and complex both horizontally and vertically the permian basin has commercial accumulations of oil and gas in stacked layers at depths ranging from  feet to more than  feet the greater permian is made up of several subsidiary basins the largest of which are the midland and the delawarethe new usgs assessment is of the wolfcamp shale in the midland basin portion of texas’ permian basin the new usgs survey estimates that there are  billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil in the wolfcamp alone quoting from the usgs news release“the fact that this is the largest assessment of continuous oil we have ever done just goes to show that even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil there is still the potential to find billions more” said walter guidroz program coordinator for the usgs energy resources program “changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable and that’s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the united states and the world”it is important to understand what this assessment actually means this oil has been assessed as an “undiscovered resource” this scientific assessment means the forecasters have a certain degree of confidence that the oil is there for this particular assessment the  confidence level is that there are at least  billion barrels there the study further estimates that there is a  chance that there are at least  billion barrels there and a  chance that there are at least  billion barrels therehowever the fact that the assessment refers to the “resource” means that they are estimating the technically recoverable oil in place this says nothing of the economics of recovering this oil the amount that would be economically worthwhile to recover at prevailing commodity prices  which would be classified as “proved reserves”  will be a smaller subset of the assessed amount it would even be zero at a sufficiently low oil price this is merely an attempt by the usgs to estimate the amount of oil that could be extracted over time if cost was not an objectbut given the history of the permian basin its a pretty safe bet that there is still a lot of oil still left to produce there the permian basin began producing oil in  the texas side of the permian has already produced nearly  billion barrels of crude as well as  trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas permian crude oil production has more than doubled since  largely as a result of hydraulic fracturing in six lowpermeability formations spraberry wolfcamp bone spring glorieta yeso and delawareaccording to the energy information administration’s eia most recent permian region drilling productivity report the permian is presently producing  million barrels per day bpd of oil and  billion cubic feet per day bcfd of natural gas this accounts for more than  of current us crude oil production and exceeds the combined oil output of the bakken and the eagle fordsource energy information administrationi have heard some dismiss this assessment as much ado about nothing and i have heard some characterize it as a new oil discovery it it neither this new usgs assessment is merely an attempt to put some framework around how much oil may exist in one of the multiple producing

texas business wire aug    pm edt amazing energy oil and gas co  amaz is pleased to announce recent results from its pecos county texas property reese pinney chief operating officer reported the company has closed the acquisition of jilpetco which greatly improves operational and cost control over our leasehold the acquired equipment includes workover rigs as well as various service equipment needed to respond quickly to maintaining and increasing our production also included in the jilpetco transaction we have purchased a drilling rig which is perfectly sized for the shallow queen sand wells we are drilling thereby providing further control over timing and costs these moves by the company not only advance our plans immediately but also serve to add a measure of protection when the industry rebounds and services become more costly or hard to obtain mr pinney continued also within the next  days we will commence a workover program on  wells implementing the completion design that has delivered the best results to date the last four wells that had this work done had an average reported ip of  barrels per day replication of this would add significantly to the companys new cash

utilize conventional drilling techniques in legacy producing shallow formations that are usually less than  ft deep giving us an advantage during these times of price volatility and allowing us to grow while others are shutting down” according to mr dunne “amazing energy oil and gas co currently owns interests in  wells in the permian basin although not all  wells are currently operating we
