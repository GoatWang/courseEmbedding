morning everyone im pleased with our start to  with a solid first quarter including record high ebit and improved margin performance our structural growth drivers and operational performance remained strong and helped us deliver these results against several challenging macroeconomic factors these results reflect global alignment and good execution on our strategies for growing the top line and improving profitability with our cost leadership initiatives the focus and momentum we have in operating globally along two product lines clean air and ride performance is also key to our positive results having two businesses with unique strengths contributes to our overall performance and to one of tennecos underlying advantages of having a business model with strong balance in addition to two product lines this balance includes differentiating global footprint a broad customer base programs spread across a large number of platforms and revenue generated in different end markets tenneco has longterm and wellestablished drivers that are creating opportunities regardless of external market factors the foundation of our business remains constant and positions us for continued growth now first taking a look at revenue on slide  total revenue excluding the impact of  million in negative currency was up  versus a year ago this quarters total valueadd revenue excluding currency increased  and includes revenue growth in both product lines with ride performance increasing  and clean air up  yearoveryear taking a closer look at these numbers our total revenue includes a  increase in light vehicle revenue outpacing a  rise in global industry production due to the strength of tennecos position on top selling vehicles worldwide we benefited from stronger volumes on current platforms and the rampup on new programs in china and europe a  increase in commercial truck and offhighway equipment revenue despite production weaknesses in these markets particularly in china and brazil where truck production was weaker than anticipated nevertheless we benefited in all three geographic segments from incremental clean air content to meet tier  final and stage iv offhighway regulations and from further penetration in china to comply with ns requirements we also had a higher ride performance commercial truck revenue in north america which includes our shock and elastomer products lastly we also had a  increase in global aftermarket revenue fueled by stronger clean air and ride performance sales in north america including from the new carquest business allin including a  currency headwind our total revenue in the quarter was  billion turning to earnings on slide six both ebit and adjusted ebit were our highest ever first quarter results adjusted ebit rose  despite  million in negative currency the improvement was driven by stronger light vehicle volumes and the rampup on launches incremental content on commercial truck and offhighway programs and a higher aftermarket sales in north america we also delivered a strong operational performance by managing costs capturing restructuring savings and executing on our cost leadership initiatives all contributing to higher earnings turning to profitability this quarter im pleased with our continuing trend of yearoveryear margin improvement adjusted valueadded ebit margin was  up from  a year ago with clean air improving  basis points and ride performance up  basis points and finally i want to point out our strong first quarter cash performance operating cash flow improved  million driven by working capital and lower interest and tax payments in summary in the first quarter we leveraged our strengths and made excellent progress on our program launches content growth and market share penetration while executing on cost initiatives which altogether are driving our performance and with that ill turn it over to brian to give more detail on our clean air and ride performance results brian j kesseler  chief operating officer thanks gregg and good morning since gregg has already covered the currency headwinds in this quarter im going to talk about revenue excluding currency which gives a better picture of our underlying performance beginning with clean air on slide  we delivered a  increase in total valueadd revenue the increase is driven by light vehicle revenue growth that continues to outpace global industry production and an increase in north america aftermarket revenue in our commercial truck and offhighway business additional content offset the impact of those – of weaknesses in those markets so revenue was roughly flat breaking down total clean air revenue by segment north america valueadd revenue increased  were pleased with the increase we had in offhighway revenue due to additional content on programs of caterpillar and john deere aftermarket was up as well so both were pretty positive on the light vehicle side our revenue was tempered by downtime with some of our customers as well as the impact of the ford f model changeover which we expect to improve sequentially throughout the year in the europe south america and india clean air segment valueadd revenue increased  on light vehicle volumes including the rampup on programs such as the new vw golf and mercedes a and bclass vehicles in europe despite week offhighway market conditions in europe revenues were up slightly due to higher content on our offhighway programs together these drivers more than offset ongoing weak markets for aftermarket exhaust products in europe and further weakening in commercial truck production in south america in the asia pacific segment clean air delivered a very strong quarter with valueadd revenue increasing  china was the driving force with strong light vehicle revenue growth driven by our platform mix and the rampup of new business with customers such as audi bmw daimler and volkswagen we continue to penetrate the china truck market this quarter with content for compliance with ns regulations however truck production volumes declined  versus a year ago so our higher content was in the phase of weak volumes looking at clean air ebit on slide  adjusted ebit was even with last year at  million including  million in negative currency adjusted valueadded ebit margin increased  basis points to  now if we switch gears to ride performance starting on slide  where you can see total revenue up  with growth in light vehicle commercial truck and the aftermarket we continue to implement our global cost leadership initiatives to drive costs out of the more than  million conventional shocks and struts we produce each year at the same time were making progress on generating growth to our monroe intelligent suspension advanced technology products first in north america revenue was about even with a year ago while we had strong revenue growth on commercial trucks and higher aftermarket sales light vehicle revenue was down due to customer downtime on several platforms in europe south america and india ride performance revenue was up  increase was driven by new light vehicle programs in europe including monroe intelligent suspension technologies on the vw golf and the volvo xc and stronger volumes in india also contributing to the increase was higher south america light vehicle revenue due to new platforms and a positive mix in a very weak production environment these positive drivers more than offset lower aftermarket sales in europe which continue to be impacted by the weak market conditions there in the asia pacific segment china drove a  increase in ride performance revenue due to higher light vehicle volumes and our strong platform mix of shock and elastomers programs with customers such as ford gm and hyundai on slide  ride performance adjusted ebit increased  to  million including  million in negative currency adjusted ebit margin was up  basis points to  the improvement this quarter was driven by higher north america aftermarket sales and commercial truck revenue as well as global light vehicle revenue growth in line with industry production additionally our earnings continue to benefit from all of our cost leadership initiatives in summary we delivered a solid quarter and im pleased with our operational performance in terms of revenue growth and execution on our cost initiatives ive just crossed  days with the tenneco team and in that time ive been to almost  facilities across our global network based on what ive seen it is very evident that we have outstanding people and whether its in our plants engineering centers or the sales and support offices we have a great team that works hard every day to drive our success i thank them for the performance this quarter and im even more excited about working with the team to accelerate achieving our objective with that ill turn the call over to ken kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks brian now lets turn to some financial updates im starting on slide  this quarter we recorded  million of restructuring and related costs  million relates to european cost – europe restructuring actions and  million was to close the justintime clean air facility in australia other than the impact of currency our run rate on savings from the european cost reduction initiative is essentially the same as the fourth quarter were still on track to reach our target annual savings rate of approximately  million although the recent changes in exchange rates will likely have a translation impact on that number moving on to tax and interest expense on slide  tax expense was  million for an effective tax rate of  in the quarter similar to last years first quarter rate we still expect the full year effective tax rate before adjustments in the range of  to  the range in the first quarter was above this range due to the mix of our earnings and jurisdictions where we cannot record a tax benefit we anticipate that the second quarter tax rate before any adjustments should be within the full year range our first quarter net tax payments were zero due to a refund of  million and during  we continue to expect cash taxes in the range of  million to  million interest expense improved  yearoveryear to  million in the quarter as a result of the refinancing completed in december when we extended maturities increased the size of our senior secured credit facility and reduced the rates on both the credit facility and the senior unsecured note we now expect annual interest expense will be between  million and  million in  turning to debt on slide  we ended the quarter with debt net of cash balances of  million reflecting our strong cash performance this quarter our leverage ratio improved to  times compared with  times a year ago let me take a minute to point out that we adopted a new accounting standard in the first quarter that required deferred debt issuance cost to be reported as a reduction of debt rather than as an asset the debt issuance cost that reduced balance sheet debt in the first quarter was  million we also reclassified the prior year debt balances to be consistent which reduced first quarter  debt by  million now lets take a closer look at cash flow on slide  as a reminder the seasonality of our business creates a greater demand for working capital in the first quarter this quarter cash used in operations was  million an improvement of  million compared with last year we effectively managed our working capital as reflected in our working capital metrics overall the net working capital days outstanding were flat yearoveryear with day sales outstanding in accounts receivable excluding factoring at  days inventory days on hand at  days and days payable outstanding at  days additionally lower payments for interest and taxes contributed to our operating cash flow performance capital investments to support our structural growth were  million in the quarter similar to last year we continue to expect capital investments between  million and  million in  during the first quarter we repurchased  shares of common stock for  million and with that ill turn the call back over to gregg gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer thank you ken just to recap the first quarter from my perspective i was very pleased with our record ebit performance a continuing yearoveryear improvement in margins and our cash performance our underlying revenue growth was right on plan and as i said at the outset i believe much can be attributed to the balance were achieving across two very strong product lines and our broad platform and customer base as well as geographic balance and inmarket diversity our entire organization is aligned and has considerable momentum to continue delivering excellent performance and im very proud of all our employees for their dedication and customer focus now turning to our outlook for the second quarter on slide  were confident in our foundation for continued growth built on the strength of our clean air and ride performance businesses our structural growth drivers are firmly established and we continue to improve operationally in the second quarter excluding currency we expect to grow total revenue by  compared with a year ago based on current exchange rates we anticipate a second quarter currency headwind of approximately  for the full year were still comfortable with our original guidance of  to  revenue growth excluding currency now taking a closer look at our revenue drivers beginning with clean air in light vehicles ihs automotive is expecting a  rise in global industry production in the second quarter were wellpositioned to leverage these stronger volumes with content on strong selling vehicles worldwide and continuing to rampup on new launches in our clean air commercial truck and offhighway business we see no change in our incremental content on programs to meet tier  final and stage iv offhighway regulations in north america and europe the increased content applies to larger engines launched last year and new launches this year for mediumsized diesel engines were also seeing a positive content contribution in china for ns onroad emission requirements in japan were launching new programs with kubota for export to europe and north america also in europe were in the rampup of our agco offhighway business finally in the second quarter we will begin launching a full us compliant system on a medium duty truck program in north america as you can see we have a lot of program activity with both our light vehicle and commercial truck and offhighway customers and were totally focused on making each launch successful in ride performance were also well positioned to leverage higher global production volumes with our strong platform position and will continue to benefit from our monroe intelligent suspension technologies on an increasing number of vehicle models we also expect a solid contribution from the aftermarket in the second quarter led by strong north america ride performance sales aftermarket accounts for nearly  of total ride performance revenue and the second quarter is seasonally our strongest quarter were also continuing to drive margin improvement with the number of ride performance initiatives that leverage the  million conventional shocks and struts that we produce each year in closing i want to emphasize that our entire organization is energized around our business and our future success we delivered a solid quarter and were focused on the second quarter and im confident were on our way to a successful  and a very bright future beyond and with that ill open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session of todays conference our first question comes from brian johnson sir your line is now open brian arthur johnson  barclays capital inc thank you i have a broader question could you just maybe remind us of the drivers for the second half  acceleration and growth is it the production schedules on commercial in china or is it some of the newer technologies that youve talked about like currency scr on the emissions control side or on the ride performance side the intelligent adjusting shocks gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer i think its a little bit of all of that i mean we do anticipate continuing strength in china particularly on the light vehicle side commercial vehicle is a little weak over there production wise but our penetration continues to go up to meet the ns requirements so we kind of have to wait and see how that turns out but allinall the cadence of the launch is the tier  final large engine stuff kind of continues to be an incremental improvement which we started launching last year probably the bigger uptick would be on the middle size engines as they ramp up throughout the year where theyre really none last year and that ramp up is underway and then we mentioned a couple of the new launches and kubota and agco as those continue to build through the year im not sure if im missing anything there ken kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i mean brian the other point obviously the light vehicle which is the biggest driver of our revenue if you look at the ihs projections for production the yearoveryear increase actually peaks in the third quarter i mean instead  of fairly weak first quarter and second quarter in terms of yearoveryear up lowsingle digits and i think the third quarter is up in the  to  range so obviously thats going to be a big driver as well brian arthur johnson  barclays capital inc okay and one more question on the ride performance margins in europe i know youre doing some restructuring in spain we did see at least last quarter last half margins found yearoveryear in europe ride production when do you think that turns around whens the restructuring done and what the trajectory of margins in that segment kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president also brian as weve talked about for a while the restructuring in europe is a bit more drawn  out than certainly any of us would expect weve said we dont expect to reach a run rate on our restructuring savings until sometime in  so were still a ways away from getting there in the quarter we had an unfavorable platform mix that was a bit of a headwind but the bigger driver of the margins in the quarter is just the weakness in the european aftermarket that market continues to be weak our share is the same or better than it was but that market in total is currently having an impact from a margin perspective and thats the biggest driver in the quarter brian arthur johnson  barclays capital inc okay but it sounds like in – on north america youre seeing good demand in terms of orders and restocking the channels asking for coming into second quarter kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah the aftermarket in north america continues to do quite well like you said we havent seen anything that indicates that out the door sales for our customers are a particular challenge and in addition like weve talked about for the last couple of quarters weve got the incremental revenue associated with the carquest helping us as well brian arthur johnson  barclays capital inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from brett hoselton sir your line is now open brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc good morning gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer good morning kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc couple of questions quick questions yeah first of all  revenue guidance based on your guidance as of the fourth quarter it kind of seems like youre still targeting  to  growth the europe the fx seems to be kind of in that  headwind range for the full year ken i presume that youve kind of updated the numbers is that in line with what youre thinking very roughly at this point in time kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i mean the fx piece brett i wish i could predict but i guess if i could then i probably wouldnt be talking to you on the phone today certainly weve seen the dollar strengthen throughout the first quarter i think when we started the first quarter in terms of our first quarter revenues we were expecting somewhere in the  currency headwind and as we talked about it it went wound up being  so certainly that if it stays where it is were probably somewhere in that range maybe slightly higher as we move through the rest of the year but were waiting to see what happens with the currency exchange rates brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc perfect and then – and i apologize i know brian asked the question about revenue and i kind of got distracted so its maybe a bit of a repeat but i was hoping you could dial in a little bit more closely on the commercial truck and offhighway outlook for the year i think during the last call you talked about kind of allin your expectations were kind of flat to up singledigits including fx and other things along those lines seems like fx might be a little bit greater headwind whats your general expectations for the commercial truck and offhighway youre up  in the first quarter is the thought that its going to be kind of just up a little bit through the remaining three quarters or is there some reason to believe that its going to accelerate or possibly theres some reason to believe that its going to actually decelerate and maybe start to decline through the remainder of the year gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer it could be a little bit lumpy as we go through the year i dont think we see any change to the original outlook we gave you the  to  total revenue growth whatever the commercial truck piece that was inside of that obviously were up just  in the first quarter theres a little bit of pressure in the second quarter we know chinas production levels on trucks are down like  i believe this is the latest forecast and thats what they were down in the first quarter and china is hard to predict so thats kind of remains to be seen as we go through the year on the production side but like i said the ns penetration continues to improve by that i mean the content growth were getting is theyre ordering more and more of a percent of the trucks with that content and then we dont see any change to the tier  final stage iv ramp through the year from what we saw at the beginning of the year and we also mentioned the launches that are ramping up on some specific customers particularly kubota agco and one that we cant name yet but its here in north america on mediumduty trucks which will help as we go through the year as well but we just dont see any change right now its still going to be a very challenging year the markets are weak we know that we said that at the outset were not seeing any change overall to that just a couple regions maybe that are at least in the first quarter a little bit weaker than we anticipated and that would be china onroad truck and brazil onroad truck brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc excellent gregg thank you very much ken thank you gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer thanks brett operator all right our next question comes from richard hilgert sir your line is now open richard john hilgert  morningstar research thanks good morning everyone just a couple of questions on margin it looks like asia pacific really took off this quarter on the margins versus the first quarter of last year and i was wondering can you give us a little bit of color of what might have been happening in that region that brought that up was it just operating leverage and the amount of volume that youre putting through there growing or is there something else going on in the region that brought the margins up kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i mean richard you really hit the nail in the head i mean the volumes are strong in china youll recall a few years ago we had to add some additional capacity to deal with the growth in china and weve certainly been filling that capacity up so weve got some fixed cost absorption that helps us and the market remained strong and weve got a great platform mix on both the clean air and the ride performance side the ones that tend to sell well in china and so we have continued to see our revenue grow faster than the light vehicle production levels in china as well so all that works in our favor richard john hilgert  morningstar research okay great yeah and then ride performance ride control in north america also up over about  basis points ebitda margin i was wondering is that more of the higher priced electronicallycontrolled suspension product or is that more aftermarket whats going on there kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president so i mean richard remember that the electronicallycontrolled components are really only built and sold in europe at this point wed certainly love to see more penetration in north america but that hasnt occurred so its really europe that sees any benefit from the monroe intelligent suspension in the north america ride business again weve got some good production levels weve got manufacturing improvements on the original equipment side and the aftermarket continues to do well also so all that is a really positive drive on a yearoveryear basis richard john hilgert  morningstar research okay and then with the  million in ebit from currency in the margin excluding the currency impact would youve been about flat yearoveryear eps including the tax kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so  million of ebit is about  of eps if thats your question richard john hilgert  morningstar research yeah okay so kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president right richard john hilgert  morningstar research but thats including tax too thats aftertax right kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah thats right aftertax right so we got about  million shares outstanding so if you take an aftertax number on  million youd get to about a  for every million in ebit richard john hilgert  morningstar research okay great thanks guys appreciate it operator all right and our next question comes from colin langan sir your line is now open colin michael langan  ubs securities llc great thank you for taking my question first can you give any color on you mentioned there is a higher take rate in china on truck i mean any sense of the penetration and how you expect that to trend and any color on your share on that market as its starting to rampup kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah colin so we said at the beginning of the year that we were anticipating something i think around   penetration rate or installation rate whatever you want to call it i dont know that were much off from that at least at this point i cant predict whats going to happen for the rest of the year but we are seeing the content additions that we expected with the customers that we expected so that continues to go as well as we could expect especially in the phase of the weak volumes that were seeing right now in china for the commercial truck business colin michael langan  ubs securities llc and any color on your share in china commercial truck kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president so you know weve had the list of our customers in our investor presentation for quite a while it stays the same so really no change in what weve talked about before colin colin michael langan  ubs securities llc okay and gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer were very well positioned kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president absolutely gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer with those customers and extremely pleased share is a little difficult to actually calculate right now because different customers have different penetration rates of even taking this product and we dont know what some of the others would be we would only know our own customers so we kind of were not going to really give you a share or percent right now but its positive we know that and the take rate continues to go up and its – were extremely well positioned with the number of truck companies that do represent a huge share of the china market ultimately kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah colin qualitatively because i dont have a quantitative number to give you for the reasons that gregg said we believe weve got the larger share of the commercial truck after treatment market in china were number one colin michael langan  ubs securities llc perfect can you give an update on navistar the roll off there is that – i imagine that was a headwind this quarter when does that do we start announcing yearoveryear headwind that roll off kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so colin that will continue to roll off slowly i think what we said in the fourth quarter was we didnt expect to have to talk about it again maybe thats the best way to put it gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer thats right its a small effect now kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president well lot of diminishing returns colin michael langan  ubs securities llc okay and just one last more longer term question can you give any color on when we look at north america clean air margins versus europe south america and india why does these trucks so different i mean can you get those margins in europe south america and india to the north america level over longterm or if theres just some structural issue that keeps those lower gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer yeah the way ive always looked at that is on a similar platform basis i see no reason that margins cant be similar between the european market and north american market in other words a cclass platform or a luxury vehicle platform or whatever the mix will always be stronger in north america towards the higher profitable the light trucks for example they dont have really in europe so from a mix point of view north america well i think its pretty safe to say will always be pretty favorable there and that would account for higher margins than our european business colin michael langan  ubs securities llc okay all right thank you very much operator and our next question comes from rich kwas your line is now open rich m kwas  wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everyone gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer morning kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president morning rich m kwas  wells fargo securities llc so on the – on china commercial  down q something similar for q ken or gregg whats the embedded outlook for the balance of your second half of the year in the  to  organic growth for china commercial kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president so richard at the beginning of the year we expected china to be down a little bit to maybe as good as flat yearoveryear so clearly its down some on an overall basis though i mean weve seen platforms including in china that are doing better on the light vehicle side we had anticipated so the  to  thats why we said again were very comfortable with where we are on the  to  excluding currency its really the balance of the business light vehicle commercial truck offhighway and the aftermarket they get this to that  to  rich m kwas  wells fargo securities llc but is the commercial – china commercial does it get less worse as the year goes on kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president certainly are expecting based on the projections weve seen from some thirdparties that the second half of the year is better than the first half of the year i just cant tell you for sure how accurate those estimates are at this point rich m kwas  wells fargo securities llc but its fair to say relative to february when you reported q the china commercial is worse for the full year being made up by strength in light vehicle is that the way to think about it gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer thats probably fare enough kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yep rich m kwas  wells fargo securities llc okay and then ken on the buyback theres a little bit of buyback this quarter youve talked about funding in for the free cash flow your free cash flow – your cash generation is somewhat lumpy seasonal so how should we think about deploying capital going forward here can we think of you being a little more aggressive potentially even when theres quarters where cash flow generation is modest how should we think about that considering in the valuation of the stock et cetera kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so rich we – i mean we think about all of our investment opportunities including share repurchases over the longterm right remember that the goal of the repurchase program is really to return value to shareholders but after we met all other investment needs so growth in the business opportunities for new business but also maintaining the balance sheet strength that weve got you saw us in the first quarter we are able to maintain and actually slightly improve that leverage ratio but we do intent to use like you said our free cash flow so i would expect over the next three years you would see the buyback opportunity fairly mirror what our overall free cash flow for those three years is rich m kwas  wells fargo securities llc but do we think of it as being lumpy in the seasonality with the free cash flow where q is typically very strong q is modestly positive and you have outflows in q do we think of it that way in terms of mapping it or  kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president rich we havent tried to talk about what the quarterly plans are what the quarterly decisions will be to repurchase shares but weve just tried to kind of focus everybody on the longer term so i dont have any answer to your quarterly question rich m kwas  wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you operator next question comes from joe spak sir your line is now open joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone first of all thanks for the disclosure on organic growth on commercial vehicles in the quarter is it possible to get that what you think that was for all of  as well gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer the organic growth for commercial joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc yeah because you said you were saying plus  but then obviously with currency i think it was actually down  so – and i think in the  youve reported it all in so just wanted to get any sense of what do you think that was in  kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president so the percentages we gave you in  which i dont remember off the top of my head right now joe were – i mean the currency was not a big impact in  right joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc okay okay kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president the currency didnt start to weaken until really in the fourth quarter joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc okay okay so then my next question would be on the noncontrolling interest which is i guess part of your sort of little preannouncement as well that was up  my understanding is thats mostly china so i mean is there something unusual there or is it a fair read that your china income was up  kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president so joe i mean just a quick reminder right the noncontrolling interest is the share of our joint ventures which are primarily in china joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc okay kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president thats owned by minority interest owners right and that ranges the percentage ranges from – our ownership percentage ranges from as low as  to as high as probably  or  so as china income changes thats the primary driver of the change in noncontrolling interest asia pacific is primarily driven by what happens in china thailand korea japan are in there those are fairly small australia used to be larger and as weve talked about several times over the last couple of years is continuing to shrink simply because of the fact that the original equipment manufacturers are exiting australia so what you see in the asia pacific results is obviously primarily driven by what goes on in china when youre thinking about noncontrolling interest its movement its change like we said number of times before really should be related to what happens in the asia pac ebit numbers joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc okay so thats – so i mean when you talked about obviously some good rampup in china so through those two metrics thats how were seeing gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer yeah and i also think if you looked at our noncontrolling interest expense in the fourth quarter of last year were not that different from it so i mean if you look at on our run rate basis it probably built through the year i didnt look at it quarterbyquarter but the first quarter of last year to the fourth quarter it had substantially increased because our earnings had substantially increased and thats just continuing into this year we didnt reset in the first quarter if you will joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc right okay and then last question is im sure you guys saw the icct i guess it was out there saying some of the real worlds clean diesel results werent as good as maybe some of the test results and i guess you could sort of read that two ways one is sort of the continued shift from diesel maybe to gas in the light vehicle side or that automakers need to turn to better nox equipment or more robust nox equipment so i guess just as – and especially as we sort of move towards harmonized testing i think finalization later this year maybe just some updated thoughts on how youre thinking about how that could impact your business gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer first off youre absolutely right ive read some of those reports and its probably being addressed customer by customer a little bit differently i mean i havent – theres certainly not been a direct impact on our business its really a matter of the test regime as i understand it so everyone meets the test regime as its designed when you launch the vehicle and then there is the socalled how well does that test regime actually reflect as youd pointed out real world driving conditions which may in fact drive some changes to the test regime not clear to me yet but im sure theyre studying all of that and if anything i mean we can meet it we know that we got plenty of room to meet any of those real world driving i really wanted to  design the test regime because ultimately all we know is what comes out of a test right and so i dont see any real big impact if anything it could be slightly positive it probably just all depends on what approach any given customer took to try to resolve it given they are faced with the resolution depending on how these real world driving conditions are rolled into any test specifications joseph r spak  rbc capital markets llc okay thanks a lot guys operator next question comes from ryan brinkman sir your line is now open ryan j brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my question just curious firstly what youre seeing in terms of commodity prices both the impact to q and the full year i understand your precious metals are essentially entirely passthrough but i would expect they also have some decent nonprecious metal exposure there particularly on the ride control side so has it been helping and should we expect that tailwind to perhaps strengthen some how to think about that kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president so ryan commodities are certainly favorable remember that our biggest buy and im going to – like you said im going to take the substrate components out because the precious metal is literally a passthrough but our biggest buy is steel a lot of number of different grades of steel the most vulnerable piece of that is the alloy components of the stainless steel that we buy and its mostly chromium alloy in north america mostly nickel alloy in europe and remember that over the course of the last seven years or eight years as weve seen volatility in that we work very hard to get arrangements so that we get changes in our pricing associated with that therefore as those go both up and down they really have much less of an impact on our margins we are anticipating – seen a little bit of good news but like i said weve also got some arrangements with our customers that require a good bit of that to go back to them ryan j brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay great and then can you just help to quantify you discussed it a bit but maybe better help frame your exposure to south america the various countries and currencies there maybe how much of a drag was it this quarter and is it still the case that youre growing there because of the new content being added or does the magnitude of industry decline now and youre just having become more established there in recent years mean that this is a drag to organic growth now kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president so most of our business in south america exist in brazil and argentina we dont really have anything in venezuela which seems to be one thats gotten the most press so were more exposed to what happens to brazil and argentina on content remember that the regulations changed on the commercial truck side back in  so its not really a content issue its just the movement of the overall market and also theres not been a recent change in light vehicle emission regulations in south america either so right now its really whats happening with the production levels that market obviously as weve talked about for the last several quarters is – has been very weak hopefully we see some good news later this year maybe third quarter or fourth quarter based on some of the projections that ive seen but at this point its just an economic issue with whats going on in the brazil and argentina economies ryan j brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay okay and then joe asked about cv growth by your metric in  what about in the first quarter of  that we could compare the  organic revenue growth to so did it decline         i dont know its a lot right and then just how to think about commercial vehicle production growth as the year progresses and then your performance relative to that growth or contraction kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so i dont have the currency impact by individual platform or segmented platform to give you but i mean obviously like we said currency is a headwind and its probably not that much different for the commercial truck offhighway business than it is for the business as a whole in terms of penetration i mean youve seen the list of our customers thats a pretty extensive list and were going to – we will continue to add the content that we anticipated the good news is although were in a downturn right now i mean obviously the next move should be up for overall volumes by the time that happens we should have all the content installed and so we should see some pretty good recovery ryan j brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay great and just last question on the last i guess on the q call there was some discussion of the f changeover and according to ihs it looks like it was at least a similarly big drag in q something like down  yearoveryear so how has your business there been tracking how do you expect it to track going forward and is that – what is your exposure there its large right so as you go from being down something like  to being up in the backhalf of the year does that kind of derisk this improvement in your organic revenue growth from like  q  in q to  to  for the full year is that meaningful for you brian j kesseler  chief operating officer yeah this is brian the f program was obviously a large program for us the numbers you recalled in q were right i mean we saw minus  yearonyear q the ihs numbers say will be slightly lower minus  production volume but then that starts picking up in q about  and  in q as they come right out of that changeover so that will obviously sequentially help our business there kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah the fs are sixth largest platform and its about  of revenues ryan j brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc right okay so yeah i mean if its down  i mean thats  kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president  ryan j brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc drag here whole organic revenue growth okay very helpful thanks so much brian j kesseler  chief operating officer thank you operator okay next question comes from pat arshall  sir your line is now open unknown speaker hi yeah good morning gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer good morning unknown speaker just two left for me can you just remind us like in terms of the offhighway stuff whats your relative exposure in ag versus construction i dont know if youd sort of mentioned that previously but i would guess construction has obviously more material just given your presence with cat but youve mentioned some pretty big business wins with some of the ag guys as well so i wanted a little bit of perspective on that kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so pat  you know like weve kind of pointed out before that its difficult for us to tell you for sure because we build after treatment for an engine and i cant tell you for example for deere whether that engine goes into a tractor or goes into a bulldozer right thats build by deere but if you look at the fact that our cat – again we are cats provider of after treatment in north america and europe which is where the regulations exist so were really anywhere that its required globally for deere the tier  interim is a shared piece but the tier  final is all tenneco so we are primarily – we are the primary provider for both of those customers so if you wanted to try and triangulate our exposure to the construction and the ag market you would look at those guys relative share and that would be the best probably example that i could give you unknown speaker okay and just maybe building off that i mean any color at least from those contracts where there is clear visibility is there any kind of color you can give us on the end markets what seems to be discussed out there right now is that construction is actually picking up a little bit although and ag remains weak but i dont know what you guys are seeing on the ground gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer if you look at all of those markets the two biggest for us clearly are construction and agriculture we dont know the exact split here this morning construction is probably slightly bigger but agriculture were still very significantly exposed to through deere and of course the building business at agco right then if you get into the other markets which are smaller the forestry the – and for us mining because mining is mainly done in regions that arent even regulated sort of et cetera so were going to be pretty heavily exposed to the construction and ag there has been a little bit of uptick i dont know if its just noise in the system or not right now that construction has picked up a tad we dont really see it in the production schedules at this point it could be positive news well just have to wait and see unknown speaker okay i appreciate that last one for me is you manage to put together a pretty good margin performance despite the headwinds how do you see i think its  basis points on valueadd up yearonyear i know you guys dont give specific margin guidance for the year but how sustainable is that what are the – in subsequent quarters what are the main drivers to continue to see some kind of an expansion despite what are some challenging end markets gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think the drivers is just momentum and what weve been doing we do continue to launch platforms in both light vehicle and certainly commercial onroad and offroad that are positive to our margin so that continues and you kind of heard us talk a little bit about the cadence of that this morning strong north american aftermarket helps certainly us drive our margins and then i think were just getting a lot of traction under our overall cost focus initiatives that weve been talking about now for several quarters and youre seeing us drive bottom line performance there as well so i think its just momentum that weve got and we still see runway left in driving those margins and again i think we talked back in february it was our anticipation that we would drive margin improvement this year again we dont say that quarter to quarter because various things can happen noise in the system quarterly but over the course of the year we still expect to drive margins and were very pleased that we did in the first quarter so unknown speaker okay great thats all i had thanks for taking my question gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer thank you kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks operator our next question comes from brian sponheimer sir your line is now open brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company hi good morning guys gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer morning kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president morning brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company just one question on the aftermarket side any change – you mentioned the carquest business being an additional set of revenues for you any change in terms coming from advance that could potentially flowthrough from a working capital perspective as we look out the next  months to  months kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president no brian dont expect anything there brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company all right all right thank you very much gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator theres no further questions at this time next question comes from emmanuel rosner sir your line is now open emmanuel rosner  crédit agricole securities hi good morning everybody kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer morning emmanuel rosner  crédit agricole securities just couple of points of clarification on the f beyond the improved production cadence in the second half do you also have increased content versus the old platform gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer i think we said before we have pretty much the same content versus the old platform kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president right emmanuel rosner  crédit agricole securities okay and then also just a final point on the commercial vehicle outlook for the rest of the year so you gave a lot of good drivers for increased content and new launches but at the same time some of the markets obviously are quite weak particularly in china do you still believe you can do the strong yearoveryear revenue growth specifically in commercial truck and offhighway that was part of your february outlook or do you think that you can get through overall the same goal for the company but it might be more from light and less from commercial gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer we still see that were going to hear our total revenue including aftermarket thats all our markets like commercial onroad offroad  to  for the year as you go through the years there can always be some gives and takes but we dont see a great deal of difference than what we saw back in february when we gave that guidance we see all of them help and contribute a little bit as we go through the year and yeah so far this year as weve said theres been a little bit of unexpected weakness or more than normal unexpected weakness in the china truck and brazil markets but all in all we dont see it affecting our  to  overall goal emmanuel rosner  crédit agricole securities okay and then one last one from me just a little bit longer term i guess beyond this year when i look at some of these regulatory drivers of your growth in the commercial and offhighway business a lot of these regulations have sort of kicked in and being phased in between last year and this year in the us in europe in china and obviously youre seeing the benefit of that in your organic growth when we look beyond  what are the big pieces of what we should focus on – what will move the needle for your commercial and offhighway revenue geographically and from a regulation point of view gregg m sherrill  chairman  chief executive officer as you look beyond  and again were going to talk china for just a minute because particularly in beijing where they could be moving on to beijing  and beijing  and then to the extent that that might drag the rest of the country in that way and we know that china is putting an incredible amount of attention from the central government point of view on their air pollution problem so we continue to see potential just because were getting ns penetration now its very positive thing theyre not going to continue to increment those regulations to really get out the particular matter even more so than they are right now and continue to drive on nox remembering that theyve had a big headwind as theyve tried to get their fuel at the quality level that they need and theyre getting closer and closer there as well so theres a lot of things going on in china but from a regulatory point of view also beginning in  moving back to the light vehicle side of the business the us fed tier  which phases in over a number of years will drive some more content as well as what were seeing in the euro c light vehicle sort of a similar thing going on in europe so yeah theres still regulatory content coming in weve just come through a heavy period of diesel regulation and now theres kind of a look back again at regulation driving not only continue to drive diesel but gasoline engines as well kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice president operator operator yes sir kenneth r trammell  chief financial officer  executive vice
