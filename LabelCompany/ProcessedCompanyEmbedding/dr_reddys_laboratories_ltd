separate company with external source of funding perlecan pharma was partially funded by icici venture capital and citigroup venture international both of which held a  stake in perlecan for an estimated  million however the company was forced to buy back the perlecan shares from icici and citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in perlecans pipeline at that point perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary in the board meeting of  october  the company chose to amalgamateabsorb perlecan thereby making it an inhouse research facility as it was before  in  the company did a uturn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its bangalorebased subsidiary with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether the company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding  recalledit in june  certain lots of dr reddys generic

this section all the amounts are translated into us dollars at the convenient translation rate of  which is the rate as of st march  consolidated revenues for the year are at inr crores or  billion and declined by  year on year consolidated revenue for the quarter are inr crores or  million and declined  year on year and  sequentially this is broadly in line with what we had alluded in our last earnings conference call this decline is primarily on account of continuing price increases no new significant product launch in the quarter together with supply constraints impacting our north america generics business on the other side the branded generics market performed better especially the russian operations which had the benefit of strong ruble and stable economic outlook revenues from our global generics segment are  million and psai segments are  million consolidated gross profit margin for the quarter is  gross margin for global generics and psai were at  and  respectively relative to the previous quarter this is a sharp decline there are a few important figures during the quarter bringing down the gross margin by approximately  basis point these are a impairment charge recorded at our antibiotics manufacturing facility at bristol b incremental provision of inventory buildup in anticipation of new product launch that failed to materialize for example sumatriptan b c the failure to supply penalties incurred due to supply disruption for example eszopiclone d unprecedented level of price erosion and e higher levels of repair and some maintenance charges incurred in order to renew some of the manufacturing facilities moving on sga spend including amortization for the quarter is  million a decrease of  yearonyear after normalization of the venezuela base effect its approximately at the same level of debt of quarter four of fy  so overall we continue to explore revenues to optimize sga spend rd expense for the quarter were at  million representing  revenues and is in line with management estimates it is  for the full year ebitda for the quarter stands at  million which is around  of revenue the lower revenues and gross margins primarily impacted ebitda margin during the quarter we generated around  million worth of cash flows from operations our net debttoequity ratio has marginally improved to  as on st march  the effective tax rate is around  for the year and  for the quarter the lower tax rate for the quarter is primarily due to resolution of certain tax matters pertaining to prior years however we anticipate the effective tax rate for fy  to be in the range of  to  key balance sheet highlights are as follows our operating working capital decreased by  million during the quarter we will continually focus on optimizing the working capital cycle the capital expenditure for the quarter was at  million and for the full year it was  million foreign currency cash flow ranges for the next  months in the form of derivatives per us dollar are approximately  million largely hedged around the range of inr  to inr  to the dollar in addition we have balance sheet areas of around  million we also have foreign currency cash flow hedges of rub  million at the rate of inr  to the ruble maturing over next three months with these i now request abhijit to take us through the key business highlights abhijit mukherjee thanks saumen greetings to everybody and i extend a warm welcome to you on this earnings conference call as you will recall in the last earnings conference call we had alluded to a softer fourth quarter and developed a largely  in line with our expectations let me take you through some of the business highlights for each of our key markets please note that in this section all references to numbers are in respective local currencies our north america generic revenues for this quarter are  million we closed the year at  million during the year we witnessed increased competitive intensity in a few of our high value assets normalizing for that the base business has held up reasonably well in line with our expectations the approval for high value launches continue to remain a challenge during the fiscal the time lines for review of complex products and subsequent approvals from the agency have been getting better we continue to work with the agency and remain optimistic about the eventual approvals our new launches calendar for the coming fiscal looks healthy and we expect  plus launches in the current  in the next  months the current quarter also witnessed initiation of monetization of the teva deal through our commercialization of g vytorin the first product from the transaction these are limited to their market and we expect  were excited about this opportunity during the quarter we have filed  andas taking the total to  filings in the fiscal year this is indicative of our continuing focus on investing for long term growth and rd productivity continuing on pure generics our europe business is fairly stable now and well poised to deliver profitable growth on the back of new product launches and traction in new markets our emerging markets business is on track of gradual recovery russia business closed the year with  constant currency growth and  for the quarter this is broadly in line with our expectations we continue to focus on improving productivity and augmenting the pipeline during the quarter the much awaited national tender of rituximab was announced and we secured shares and we have commenced supplies in the current quarter as such the performance over the other markets was in line with our expectations were on track to expand our geographic presence through leverage  of our institution business portfolio and biosimilars commercialization of biosimilars across emerging markets has now started gaining meaningful traction we remain optimistic of building this momentum further india business revenues are inr crores and grew by  yoy we closed the year at inr crores and grew by  normalized for nlem impact the results are in line with our expectations we continue to focus on productivity enhancements and portfolio augmentation psai business posted revenues of  million the business is gaining traction in emerging markets with healthy margins our efforts are directed towards building a healthy order book cps business has done well this quarter on proprietary products we continue to grow the business and we are witnessing improving trends for zembrace and sernivo as of date we have two pending ndas with the agency and one nda recently approved that is the doxycycline in hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets further during the quarter we have settled the ongoing litigation on doxycycline that is zenavod with galderma consequent to the settlement and our licensing arrangement we received an upfront amount and there are annual royalty performance indiscernible that concludes my part thank you all and i would like to now open the floor for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you very much operator instructions well take the first question from the line of neha manpuria from j p morgan please go ahead neha manpuria so first on the gross margins you mentioned quite a few sort of one offs in the quarter could you give us anything  i mean some of this could be recurring but in terms of impairment of the bristol facility and provision for new  how much of that  the impact in the quarters one off or is this likely to be recurring for a few quarters saumen chakraborty the impairment facility doesnt recur so we were earlier carrying a value of almost  million for the bristol facility now after this impairment the value is around  million so this is of course done with all anticipated future earnings that this is only an antibiotics facility so there have been some specific  api supply problems also were there so we are not getting much business out of that facility so as for the impairment trigger we have to take this impairment this is really  whenever there are such trigger for recipe but normally we dont expect that in the  what i talked about the material inventory write off provision that happened several times it happened but this time the incremental one is much higher because we built up in anticipation of launch which has not happened so we had to take the entire write off during the quarter neha manpuria how much would this be sir roughly saumen chakraborty i will get back to you the numbers later neha manpuria no worries sir and sir on the isotretinoin supply that could disrupt this by when do we expect this to normalize would this take a couple of more quarters saumen chakraborty we are expecting approval from abhijit mukherjee we have applied for a few years as and when that gets approved wouldnt put a date exactly but i think your question was more on fts incurred i think that tapers down as it happens only after discontinuation so that is also a one off this quarter neha manpuria okay got it and my last question was on the launch so if i remember correctly last quarter youd indicated about  plus launches in fy  and were now talking about  plus launches is this because were expecting some delays due to the inspections that have happened recently anil namboodiripad this is well  indicative its  at the beginning of the year currently your guess is as good as mine in april we have been able to do  g vytorin and suboxone generic so  okay lets take it  to  somewhere in between saumen chakraborty we dont have the right answer we dont know what to say either operator well take the next question from the line of prakash agarwal from axis capital please go ahead prakash agarwal just trying to understand the filing run rate has been pretty significant despite duvvada bachupally and other all the facilities having some observations and earlier ones still stuck up so where are these filings from which facilities are these filings happening anil namboodiripad mixed all over so this is from some from partners some internal distributed amounts various locations we have two other solid locations a topical location and then you have ingestible location and several partners as well prakash agarwal so most facilities are under some us fda still having some fda issues so we continue to file so what im trying to understand is we do expect  do not expect any escalation in duvvada bachupally and all anil namboodiripad well i mean i wont when you say most facilities are impacted there first of all the api facilities mostly have gone through world audits all three of them duvvada is the only one where we had to sort of  that observations will have to sort of  we responded well and lets see how that sort of  but that doesnt prevent us from filing its our judgment but we continue to file yes we also filed some ingestibles from partners well as far as bachupally is concerned we mentioned that in our view these are procedural and well sort of deal with this with the necessary response and whatever interventions prakash agarwal okay and srikakulam is there any update sir abhijit mukherjee i use probably its in public domain the observations right only two of them are very relatively easy to answer observations and we had three from the miryalaguda two api sites which were impacted and the third api site had zero observation yes i mean update from miryalaguda we have just got a cb  approval which was earlier stuck so thats in a way i will take it as a positive prakash agarwal no no sir srikakulam abhijit mukherjee yes as ive mentioned srikakulam an audit happened after this theres no update meaning therell be no  we respond and then we will know the subsequent whenever files come up for approval well know i mean we dont expect prakash agarwal from our side do we expect resolution within this financial year sir abhijit mukherjee depends on what youre talking about resolution because in our view if we start getting approval in any form thats a resolution prakash agarwal thats right yes abhijit mukherjee so one miryalaguda as ive said we have got one earlier cb  they just got approval so that audit happened a little earlier a little maybe saumen chakraborty two months ago abhijit mukherjee or not even two i think its sort of a month before it indiscernible saumen chakraborty two months ago abhijit mukherjee oh two months whatever so thats the only data point we have prakash agarwal okay and lastly sir on the amortization just trying to understand vytorin was one of the products that we got from tevas drug actavis so the amortization would start for these assets that we acquired and the time lines that we are looking for the other two big ones saumen chakraborty yes i dont know when we are commercializing that will start the specific yes amortization that will happen but i dont know when well commercialize im not understanding your specific concern there what are you trying to ask prakash agarwal no im just trying to understand that the assets that we purchase for  million how are we actually amortizing the entire piece since the first product has already started saumen chakraborty there is a ppa there is a purchase price allocation which is there which has been already disclosed so based on that the amortizations will happen the products  specific product whenever it is getting commercialized prakash agarwal and the larger piece happens only when the large two products get amortized  gets approved and launched saumen chakraborty yes youre absolutely right operator thank you well take the next question from the line of anubhav aggarwal from crédit suisse please go ahead anubhav aggarwal one question on indiscernible vytorin when do you expect the next round of competition in this product and currently after the launch what market share dr reddys have gotten abhijit mukherjee so very fair market share for three players currently next round certainly i dont know so i cant comment the only i think  the public domain  from mylans con call is  they are impacted because of the market is in public domain beyond that i have no idea anubhav aggarwal so that  im aware of mylan thats exactly what i was asking beyond this but do you expect this to be as good a product for fiscal  and as good a product fiscal  as well based on your intelligence right now abhijit mukherjee how can you predict you wouldnt be knowing how where whos with enterprise with fda and all that stuff so far so good so lets continue to sell anubhav aggarwal and on the psai the margins are very weak this quarter what happened there because all the gross margins impacted saumen has talked about were largely on the global generics side what happened on the psai side saumen chakraborty the cto indiscernible we supply both to the external api as well as to our internal per indiscernible consumption so the  in turnover rate how does it get allocated so there is real considerable moment of which happened and that is a primary reason for the impact on the psai going forward and i must  who has been  we have spent much higher level of repair and maintenance than normally we spend and that we have done specifically to renew some of the city or manufacturing facilities because compared to the indiscernible these ctos were our earlier plans so we spent quite a bit on indiscernible anubhav aggarwal and can you also sir help with implied cost your implied cost is down like  in the march quarter versus your december  quarter that seems such a sharp decline there seems to be some oneoffs there saumen chakraborty so as a company we always believed in terms of putting much higher stake for our senior management top management in terms of variable pay lti and various other things which we put at stake so if there have been higher profit then there would have been a higher kind of pay  variable pay to the extent it is not there we suffered so individually we suffer but company in terms of variable cost anubhav aggarwal but this is a phenomenon which happens in the fourth quarter every year or will this saumen chakraborty it was triggered no it will all depends on the trigger if suppose we would have got the final factor on b the result would have been different for us anubhav aggarwal but this seems a very sharp decline  sequentially saumen chakraborty so maybe we can discuss offline later anil namboodiripad so essentially yes during the year you count and then you take cost at the end of the year and on the variable pay so accordingly you  yes so to that extent it has some bit of fourth quarter impact anubhav aggarwal okay just one more clarity not on discussion but on duvvada and the bachupally facility in your corrective action plan just some clarity if you can provide what time do you plan to finish the remediations from your side at least on both those plants abhijit mukherjee no i  there is  remediation as such we have mentioned last year we had spent whatever had to be spent in terms of remediation now theres some observations have come in these are more large  to a large extent to do with operator training certain operations on areas which need sort of special intervention gross and net then which will be largely internal im not sure there is a cost there are efforts but i think  i dont think that theres a significant cost involved at this stage and bachupally as i mentioned is our  most procedural and less so in terms of cost to be vetted anubhav aggarwal sir i was not asking much on the cost operator anubhav im sorry to interrupt but i would request you to come back in queue for any follow up questions operator instructions we have the next question from the line of surya patra from phillipcapital please go ahead surya patra sir just a clarification about all these remuneration activities or resolution that we are anticipating for all these three facility which is  which are currently under issue so if the resolution to happen then it will happen at a time for all the three facility or it can happen separately also abhijit mukherjee look specifically we cant comment we can only give you the data point which i just repeated that we had the miryalaguda we had srikakulam and duvvada so miryalaguda the first one to get audited and ive  we got a cb  which is earlier stock because of gnp and now we just got just a few days back the approval for that so thats the only data point that we have beyond that we wouldnt indiscernible surya patra okay since it is covered under one issue so it might not be  not necessarily a realization has to happen at a time for all that is all abhijit mukherjee there is a data point and your interpretation is yours surya patra yes okay and just one more quick query sir about the us pricing scenario for the base business how is it and do you really feel that okay theres a kind of forced stabilization in the pricing scenario there and what will be the base business price erosion if you can say for your portfolio abhijit mukherjee this year has been as saumen mentioned has been somewhat bad i guess rather indiscernible invisible when you dont have launches overall and the impactwise but overall this year has been particularly bad but these things will vary quarter to quarter company to company at average annualized we still feel that well be in the range of high single digit very low double digit type of a thing but can vary from quarter to quarter yes we have taken most of our erosions here this year not able to see very large one coming through immediately but youll never know surya patra my point was that post this election phase in the us and post the major of the controlled channel consolidation happening in the recent past so are we still seeing at this current moment some issue of a pricing price correction or increased competition in the indiscernible abhijit mukherjee elections or anything this is all about the consolidation of the content which have happened and we spoke about it i mean the channel got consolidated the impacts are showing now a price increase or price adjustments are not there at all so overall i think all that has  i dont think dynamics specifically have changed operator well take the next question from the line of sameer baisiwala from morgan stanley please go ahead sameer baisiwala abhijit is it possible for you to give a broad color for fiscal  on the top line and on the ebitda margin abhijit mukherjee no i mean saumen chakraborty we do not give financial guidance sameer you are aware of that sameer baisiwala yes fair enough not looking for guidance i think just general color is it going to be abhijit mukherjee so with general color i dont know what you mean by general color but overall i told you plus launches in us and its well known that it depends on which launches and what launches one we just sets one and its laid out well lets see how the rest of it plays out us will continue to be dominant and most unpredictable in many ways because depending on launches depending on approvals depending on resolution et cetera and all those things well be  most of the other markets i think we expect clearly northward sort of results emerging markets the currencies have stabilized we have put in significant effort in increasing footprint biologics more and more traction so expect very healthy growth there india well known maybe   range type of a thing europe is broadly in control well grow this year it has been flattish last year to this year but of this current year we grow significantly but again small pipe psai also wed expect to do certainly better much better than the last financial year but a lot would still depend on how indiscernible plays out sameer baisiwala yes thats very helpful i mean the second question on the  to  launches that you expect how many are going to be successful given specifically also on the thoughts on copaxone and nuvaring abhijit mukherjee okay ill go to the second one first one i wouldnt know i wouldnt be able to answer how many would be sort of meaningful but yes copaxone as weve mentioned we sent in our  mg response the dnfs once we had spent in quite a few months back i think december probably or something of the sort so we have received a tad of which is give or take six months from now so well wait for  hopefully i ask in between and maybe a cr i dont know but as we mentioned i still sort of feel that we have done a reasonably thorough job and lets see how that plays out nuvaring i think on the ip side i think its becoming lessandless critical because in any case its somewhat clear and then anyway that specific of ip gets over by  until next year meanwhile now addresses how we  so that  theres a cr which are planning to respond in what about few weeks from now and then lets see how that sort of progresses operator thank you we have the next question from the line of vishal manchanda from nirmal bang please go ahead vishal manchanda so in the initial commentary you had said on a licensing of zenavod so could you  i couldnt hear that clearly so if you could give more color on that saumen chakraborty could you repeat the question again licensing of vishal manchanda zenavod  it has been filed from promius pharma abhijit mukherjee zenavod saumen chakraborty okay so what is the specific question again what do you want to know vishal manchanda is there a settlement that you have entered into saumen chakraborty yes there is a settlement that we entered youre talking about the income recognition from the galderma deal vishal manchanda yes and when is the launch scheduled and saumen chakraborty can you  anil can you take this anil namboodiripad yes ill take the second part abhijit mukherjee yes and saumen you can talk about the income recognized so this was a settlement followed by a licensing and that was done with galderma so the launch is upon galderma and the intent they have expressed is to launch it at the earliest possible we do not have a specific date saumen chakraborty so in terms of  we have received some upfront cash settlement but in terms of the revenue recognition we follow strictly their accounting standard and accordingly a part has been taken to future income vishal manchanda and additionally  one more could you like also talk about the value of the rituxan tender you would have received for russian market abhijit mukherjee well in the market as you know theres a lot okay and because its been somewhat aggressive its now in a way there are russian player there and us so yes i mean ill not  lets not talk about this tender but overall i think for the year high doubledigit million dollars thats it anil namboodiripad in case that we  theres one more tender in case im assuming that we have share there as well so we got it vishal manchanda and if you could guide on how many emerging market approvals should we look at this year for your biosimilar portfolio abhijit mukherjee specifically we wouldnt comment on this but certainly one more reasonably large country yes two more smaller ones but these things depend on how these  the regulatory part there proceeds but these are certainly not as big as russia but there will be organic growth also in this product operator well take the next question from the line of nitin agarwal from idfc securities nitin agarwal now on the emerging markets you refer to the fact that you put in significant saumen chakraborty one moment let me clarify when i mentioned about the last question on the double digit which is im probably saying within  to  in that range abhijit mukherjee yes go ahead nitin agarwal so the emerging markets you mentioned about some significant effort being put in for improving footprint i mean can you throw some light on that are we referring to the efforts in existing markets or are you talking about creating some  opening up some new markets for the  on the emerging markets side saumen chakraborty both are done there are certain markets where we are present so that is done internally or at certain markets where we are not present were alliance partner so and biosimilar opportunities that we disclose indiscernible nitin agarwal so the emerging market story is now largely  is being driven through the biosimilar route in terms of any expanding emerging market presence that sees our process abhijit mukherjee well thats one major growth driver the second is we are building an institution business in various countries we have opened up in brazil and colombia and we  colombia already we had launched few products last year this year well see more and more launches and traction and growth on that brazil won is the interesting for us we are getting the institution business with the first launches just starting as we speak and in the year probably three to five launches this year and those would be the major ones and then a few north american markets few asian markets through partnership etcetera so overall were trying to build an institution business with global footprint and so largely led by oncology products nitin agarwal and these will be pretty much the products that you already commercialized in the us or europe i guess abhijit mukherjee largely indiscernible and that process will continue as we keep pricing we will continue to leverage and see how we can  and the only thing is that several markets are building their footprint and its important that we build the footprint so that we are able to get to the institutions ourselves nitin agarwal and lastly of the  to  products that you talked about launching that are currently in the us are any of them kind of contingent on the resolutions on the houston facilities abhijit mukherjee we wouldnt be providing all the details and subsequent questions from where and what so i think lets just leave it at that lets take  plus and i was supposed to commit  to  so wherever you want to sort of take that nitin so lets just leave it at that operator thank you well take the next question from the line of aishwarya agarwal from reliance mutual fund please go ahead aishwarya agarwal can you please help us with this varied key areas repeat observations so i just want to understand how serious this repeat observations are and i mean what you expect from it i mean will we be able to overcome with whatever processes youre supposed to do or will it get escalated abhijit mukherjee so i think well the observations are in public domain right now and youll have to make  if i take your call by consulting people but well give you some broad view that currently the interpretation by the agency on repeat is not specific but lets say something is called out and it falls in that category and later in that category you have observation which is maybe a different observation but it still said its considered as a repeat observation i mean this is again with the changing trend on that setting were seeing this happening repeatedly for duvvada which is probably as i had mentioned well we had spending a lot indiscernible large comprehensive response the first repeat observation is on the investigation quality now every quarter we have  and that particular observation is probably half of the whole observation we have in terms of the number of indiscernible and in investigation quality there will  every quarter we have  or not probably there are various incidents we continue to investigate and continue to make report so naturally there is scope for improvement and we are putting all efforts but there is indeed as a broad category it can come up even in the future i mean in similar areas and not to say that were putting all our efforts were trying to make it as broad umbrella effort to sort of remediate in our facilities but as a whole category sometimes this may come up aishwarya agarwal hello abhijit mukherjee yes aishwarya agarwal yes yes okay sir my next question is have you filed a copaxone formulation abhijit mukherjee yes i just mentioned that we have committed and it was filed and weve got a tad the tad is give or take six months from now operator well take the next question from the line of manoj garg from bank of america manoj garg i would like you already read a couple of time in this call regarding your em strategies both on the biosimilar side as well as on the injector business i just want to have a broader sense that three to five years down the line how big this opportunity could be for us from both the segments in the emerging market abhijit mukherjee fairly significant so i wouldnt put a figure to it but its one of the core strategic thrust areas we will put in first money  resources behind this and were doing it building that systematically yes three to five years the question is good and valid question i think fairly significant beyond that i wouldnt go any further manoj garg and if we can get some sense in terms of like the oral side of the opportunity for rituximab within those emerging market where either you have filed or you are waiting for the approval how significant that could be if you want to put some numbers out there saumen chakraborty finally indiscernible not to characterize to given any kind of financial guidance which is against our policy but to give the color and the reports which we are putting in to build in our future business growth manoj garg sure and this question is for anil like if you look for our proprietary business i think last year we had an ebitda loss of around  million  million so given the kind of ramp up which we are seeing plus more approvals which we are anticipating over the next few years how do you see the pl of your pro business moving maybe two three years down the line anil namboodiripad yes so right now we have a fairly rich pipeline of assets in latestage clinical development many of them are highvalue assets with the launch of these assets and the number of ndas that we expect to file over the next few years we anticipate to start seeing positive revenues within the next three to four years manoj garg and in terms of getting the breakeven for this business like from  million to  million kind of ebitda loss when do you see the breakeven saumen chakraborty you wanted to mean the positive cash flow revenue remains positive today abhijit mukherjee it is a positive cash flow anil namboodiripad so thats what i meant that we will start seeing positive cash flows over the next three to four years manoj garg and just on india abhijit you like you spoke about the  to  annual growth for the domestic market does it mean that probably we will be largely in line with the market growth or because i think in the past you alluded that we have done a lot of cost correction in the domestic market and going forward we expect probably  even to accelerate our domestic growth higher than the industry growth so is it because of gst youre a little conservative or like you feel that theyre maybe some two three is kind of things that growth will be in the range of  to  abhijit mukherjee youre right actually theres so much one is hearing reading seeing these days and uncertainties are all around gst and various other things so im just putting out our figures because  i mean look i wont go beyond that at the moment but yes i mean they could be a little bit higher if everything goes well operator thank you well take the next question from the line of abhishek sharma from india infoline please go ahead abhishek sharma sir did i hear you correctly you said you received the crl indiscernible abhijit mukherjee when we received or when we saumen chakraborty have we received abhijit mukherjee we are actually responding in fact in a couple of weeks within a couple of weeks yes we are  we received and we are responding to the complete response letter in a  within a couple of weeks yes abhishek sharma and what is the nature of observation sir does it relate to manufacturing or abhijit mukherjee like normal crl there are quite  these are job device combinations so there are questions on from all sections and we had to do a lot of work and we are responding and lets see  there could be a few more questions but lets see how that goes abhishek sharma as of the other question is on aloxi is there any further visibility on when you would be able to launch it now or abhijit mukherjee so youd probably have seen there are some interesting developments on the litigation side driven by another company and well be watching this closely on  this is not the b but on the  g side lets see how that unfolds so as far as the b is concerned we have appealed but it all depends on as i said on the other side on how that unfolds so whats next give or take lets say  to  days abhishek sharma your approach would remain b right and  but all the  yes abhijit mukherjee yes we have both options yes operator thank you well take the next question from the line of kartik mehta from deutsche bank please go ahead kartik mehta yes just on your inspection which happened in duvvada could you quantify if all the products which are manufactured from there have been effectively transferred to some other side in the event that we receive any occular there abhijit mukherjee youre talking of the existing commercialized product kartik mehta yes abhijit mukherjee yes the  i think we mentioned the  million ingestibles have a core side and a partner side as well but yes so that probably answers and there is one more order in solid which we dont have a partner there but i mean we stay positive about the  i really sincerely hope that it doesnt go this  the direction you said  you mentioned kartik mehta yes so again just to maybe stick on the reinspection in your consolidation with your  with your advisers do you feel that as per the global cap all three plants would  the receive in the ir are the same demeanor you just mentioned about cd but then in your view can the other two plants remain on the warning letter and any one of the other be under abhijit mukherjee yes so youve seen the observation is in public domain right and you can make your interpretation on this and the data point which we gave is from one plant we have all received that cb  so based on that you sort of have your interpretation and youre probably im sure seeing the observations from those three plants right kartik mehta yes sir the reason i asked is because im not able to make an observation because all the three plants were given  warning letter which is why it was addressed to you abhijit mukherjee so that i dont  you see thats why i cant answer the question in specifics but i can only give you a data point i can give you a data point and a data point is from one side youve got a cb  approval which was a first one of it and lets see how the rest of it unfolds kartik mehta and the second one is is that change in expectations due to the recent claros  web cycle saumen chakraborty what is it can you repeat kartik mehta which is the competition in the us intensifying abhijit mukherjee yes yes okay so youre talking  the most recent consolidation youre talking about right kartik mehta thats right abhijit mukherjee so i think the  this is not new anymore for anyone so i think well deal with the way we dealt with the previous one so as i said that i think  whatever erosion the market has seen in that range will continue and we will deal with that documentation the way we have dealt it in the past operator we have the next question from the line of saion mukherjee from nomura securities please go ahead saion mukherjee so one question on the proprietary product side if you can you noticed anyone at zembrace how are they doing and what kind of  you guided for  million to  million earlier as peak potential when do you see that coming through for these products and if you can update us on the filings that are on the prop side that youve done this year how many are pending approval and what kind of launch calendar that youre looking for fy  and  abhijit mukherjee sure so let me start with how the business is doing both zembrace and sernivo have significantly picked up since the last time we spoke which was the last quarter with zembrace prescriptions in q increased by roughly around  over q reaching more than  prescriptions per week by the end of fy  and thats what we were targeting and we are on target serving as a launch pad for fy  number of prescribers have grown nearly  which is all good indicators of how the product is being taken by the market similarly on sernivo we have more than  prescriptions per week which is quite healthy and thats how we ended fy  and a  volume increase over qs highest week so these are some indicators for you to explain that these two products are now positioned for further growth through fy  the base business has also been doing steadily so your question was around the peak sales and when we will get there so as i had mentioned to you in fy  we were facing there was some delay in terms of getting managed care off insurance coverage as of now we have  coverage with insurance plans there is still room to grow but we believe that that will happen peak sales we expect in the next three years or so for both products the other part of your question was around key launches so we have two pending ndas for fy  one of them is xeglyze which is contingent upon clearance of one of our facilities and the other is a steroid product for dermatology its a topical product for dermatology and that is expected to be approved the pdufa date is later in the year and there are several other ndas that we expect in fy  so we are not commenting on it at this time saion mukherjee sir can you throw some light on the xenoport asset i mean how that is progressing in any time line that you have visibility on in terms of filing saumen chakraborty so this will be further off in terms of the time lines from the immediate listing this has to go through its development so maybe we can take that at a later stage operator due to time constraints we will take the last question from the line of rahul sharma from karvy stock broking rahul sharma just wondered the clarity on what could be the sustainable gross margins going ahead for the company saumen chakraborty again you are speaking of financial guidance so as last time also i said normally the way we manage our business its supposed to have not plus  of the gross margins but for the last couple of years  is the right  was there maybe in few quarters we got even higher but this quarter has been specifically lower for the reasons i have explained so it could be within this range take a few hundred basis points plus or minus the  could be a normal effect rahul sharma plus or minus  is in hundred indiscernible there saumen chakraborty it could be   it depends on  you cannot be so accurate and  i am just stating we refrain from giving any financial guidance for the basis there could be a lot of uncertainties you cannot be absolutely certain about the pricing conditions the contracts that we put and all the flow so all these things affects  in terms of your margin but yes normal expectations if you wanted to model some kind of a financial modeling i am saying is here and there a few hundred basis points but  could be our normal rahul sharma if you would add up all those oneoffs which were there then what could be a gross margin for the quarter saumen chakraborty i said this would have  i mean this has declined by  basis points so if we had to add  plus  basis point it would have been around  point something rahul sharma and another thing was how has been the  a price erosion in the existing portfolio on yoy basis and on qonq in the us markets saumen chakraborty so we had already told you that this year particularly in fy  it has been tedious but it will vary also from companytocompany depending on portfolio launches and everything but we have seen fy  over fy  is a bit unprecedented because we have never seen earlier on gross level going beyond the high singledigits for this year it has been in the double digits and this quarter specifically its been higher but going forward the expectation is that it may not be that level of erosion in the indiscernible operator thank you very much due to time constraints that was the last question i now hand the conference over to mr saunak savla for closing comments saunak savla yes hi thank you for joining the call and in case if you have any additional clarifications questions please feel free to reach out

drug manufacturers but it soon started exporting to other lessregulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the us food and drug administration fda by the early s the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting

development of speciality generics was an important step for the companys growing interest in the development of new chemical entities the elements involved in creating a speciality generic such as innovation in the laboratory developing the compound and sending the sales team to the market are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug starting with speciality generics allowed the

creating a separate company with external source of funding perlecan pharma was partially funded by icici venture capital and citigroup venture international both of which held a  stake in perlecan for an estimated  million however the company was forced to buy back the perlecan shares from icici and citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in perlecans pipeline at that point perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary in the board meeting of  october  the company chose to amalgamateabsorb perlecan thereby making it an inhouse research facility as it was before  in  the company did a uturn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its bangalorebased subsidiary with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether the company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding  recalledit in june  certain lots of dr reddys generic

we feel that the needs of patients undergoing surgery will be well served by chd given their strong focus on offering targeted solutions for surgical site infections dfa has demonstrated promising

leader in the targeted prevention and treatment of drugresistant infections building on our development work with veriox™ in orthopedics and wound care dfa potentially extends our ability to help patients in the surgical setting who may be at high risk of infections without exposing the patient to large amounts of systemic antibiotics” said michael handley director and chief executive officer

dfa gentamicin and vancomycin sterile gel for surgical wound administration is a novel bioresorbable extended release phospholipidbased gel intended to be applied within the surgical incision at the time of closure to potentially reduce the risk of surgical site infection ssi the gentamicin component is intended to provide coverage for gramnegative organisms and the vancomycin component is intended to provide coverage for grampositive organisms further the gel is intended to provide a high concentration of gentamicin and vancomycin locally at the surgical site with limited systemic exposure in preclinical studies dfa has demonstrated promising properties pharmacokinetics in these preclinical studies have demonstrated high local tissue concentrations greater than four times the minimum inhibitory concentration mic for sensitive organisms and systemic concentrations at or below recommended levels after use during closure of surgical incisions preclinical models have also demonstrated efficacy in reducing infection in surgical incisions as measured by bacterial counts no adverse histopathological findings or evidence of interference in wound healing were observed clinically two human studies have been completed in abdominal surgery no safety or tolerability concerns were observed and systemic gentamicin and vancomycin levels were within acceptable limits

wwwdrreddyscom about chd bioscience chd bioscience inc is a colorado and new yorkbased biopharmaceutical company creating a new paradigm of antimicrobial therapy our approach is to provide localized targeted antimicrobial delivery at higher concentrations than can be achieved with intravenous or oral delivery and thus potentially increase the efficacy of the therapy as well as increasing the safety  specifically we believe intravenous and oral delivery of antimicrobial therapies should be the exception not the rule when treating infections the majority of infections are localizedconfined infections that systemic therapy has difficulty reaching at reasonable concentrations to provide reliable efficacious outcomes furthermore systemic therapy can have undesirable side effects in terms of potentiation of hepatotoxicity nephrotoxicity and elimination of the beneficial microbiome that provide improved immunity and resistance against opportunistic infections from bad microbes chd is developing a pipeline of products that overcome the issues involved with systemic antimicrobial therapy and establishing ourselves as the global leader in this market our first products to market will
