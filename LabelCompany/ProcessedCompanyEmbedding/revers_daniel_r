supply chain v daniel r guide jrluk n van wassenhove from the february  issue save share comment text size print pdf  buy copies view more from the february  issue explore the archive loading in recent years your company has probably spent a lot of time and money finetuning its supply chain soon you may need to give just as much thought to your reverse supply chain what is a reverse supply chain it’s the series of activities required to retrieve a used product from a customer and either dispose of it or reuse it and for a growing number of manufacturers in industries ranging from carpets to computers reverse supply chains are becoming an essential part of business in some cases companies are being forced to set up reverse supply chains because of environmental regulations or consumer pressures beginning in  for example european union legislation will require tire manufacturers operating in europe to arrange for the recycling of one used tire for every new tire they sell in other cases companies are taking the initiative seeing opportunities to reduce their operating costs by reusing products or components for instance kodak remanufactures its singleuse cameras after the film has been developed over the past decade the company has recycled more than  million cameras in more than  countries finally some companies are using reverse supply chains as integral parts of new businesses bosch for instance has built a successful business selling power hand tools that have been remanufactured whether a company is establishing a reverse supply chain by choice or necessity it will face many challenges it will have to educate customers and establish new points of contact with them decide which activities to outsource and which to do itself and in general figure out how to keep costs to a minimum while discovering innovative ways to recover value it may also have to meet stringent environmental standards to make rational decisions about the structure of a reverse supply chain it’s best to divide the chain into its five key components and analyze options costs and benefits for each product acquisition our research suggests that this task—retrieving the used product—is key to creating a profitable chain the quality quantity and timing of product returns need to be carefully managed otherwise companies may find themselves flooded with returned products of such variable quality that efficient remanufacturing is impossible companies often will need to work closely with retailers and other distributors to coordinate collection reverse logistics once collected products need to be transported to facilities for inspection sorting and disposition there is no one “best” design for a reverse logistics network each has to be tailored to the products involved and the economics of their reuse bulky products like tires for instance will require very different handling than small but fragile products like cameras companies should consider not only the costs for shipping and storing but also how quickly the value of the returned products will decline and the need for control over the products in many cases it will make sense to outsource the logistics to a specialist inspection and disposition the testing sorting and grading of returned products are laborintensive and time consuming tasks but the process can be streamlined if a company subjects the returns to quality standards and uses sensors bar codes and other technologies to automate tracking and testing in general a business should seek to make disposition decisions—based on quality product configuration or other variables—at the earliest possible stage in the returns process that can eliminate many logistics costs and get remanufactured products to market faster reconditioning companies may capture value from returned products by extracting and reconditioning components for reuse or by completely remanufacturing the products for resale reconditioning and remanufacturing processes tend to be much less predictable than traditional manufacturing because there can be a large degree of uncertainty in the timing and quality of returned products again making smart decisions early in the chain—in particular when you accept and sort returns—will help to reduce manufacturing variability and hence costs distribution and sales if a company plans to sell a recycled product it first needs to determine whether there is demand for it or whether a new market must be created if it’s the latter the company should expect to make heavy investments in consumer education and other marketing efforts potential customers for remanufactured products or components include not just the original purchasers but also new customers in different markets the company may for example want to target customers who cannot afford the new products but who would jump at the chance to buy used versions at lower prices in general the companies that have been most successful with their reverse supply chains are those that closely coordinate them with their forward supply chains creating what we call a closedloop system for example they make product design and manufacturing decisions with eventual recycling and reconditioning in mind bosch is a good example it builds sensors into the motors of its power tools which indicate whether the motor is worth reconditioning the technology dramatically reduces inspection and disposition costs enabling the company to make a profit on the remanufactured tools even with reverse supply chains forward thinking
