thank you for joining us today ill review our third quarter financial performance and then turn the call over to greg yesterday we reported record quarterly results we believe this performance demonstrates our continued focus on executing our business improvement plans running our refineries efficiently and at high rates and creating shareholder value by productively allocating cash third quarter net earnings from continuing operations were  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share last year reported results in the third quarter include an inventory charge due to a lower cost or market valuation adjustment of  million or  per diluted share this is a result of the decline in crude oil and product prices relative to our lifo carrying value excluding this impact and the exclusion of a gain related to an insurance settlement of  per share adjusted net earnings for the quarter were  million or  a share we delivered record adjusted ebitda in the third quarter of approximately  billion this represents an increase of  from  million last year this was primarily due to successful execution of our business improvement plans strong marketing sales and high utilization at our refineries refining segments adjusted ebitda for the third quarter  was approximately  billion an increase of  from  million a year ago our total refinery throughput for the quarter was  barrels a day or  utilization during the quarter we successfully completed a turnaround at our los angeles refinery our ongoing business improvement efforts at this refinery allowed us to utilize new pipeline connections and were able to share intermediate feedstock between different portions of the refinery and run at higher utilization the tesoro index was  per barrel in the third quarter with the realized gross refining margin of  per barrel or  of the tesoro index this compares to a realized gross refining margin of  a barrel or  of the tesoro index from last year this quarters capture rate was impacted by the combination of weaker crude oil differentials and maintenance activity at our los angeles refinery manufacturing costs in the third quarter decreased  per barrel over the same period last year to  per barrel this decrease was primarily due to continued lower energy prices and high refinery utilization the logistics segments adjusted ebitda was  million in the third quarter compared to  million a year ago the substantial yearoveryear increase was driven by contribution from the rockies natural gas business which delivered  million of ebitda yeartodate and increased volumes in our crude oil gathering business the total general partner and limited partner distributions received by tesoro were  million during the third quarter and  million yeartodate this is an increase of  million or  versus last year further highlighting the substantial value creation for tesoro shareholders as a result of our execution of the logistics growth plan the marketing segments ebitda was a record  million more than double the  million seen in the third quarter of last year this is primarily due to higher fuel volumes reflecting strong growth in consumer demand samestore fuel sales during the quarter were up  relative to last year as a result of driving strong operating performance through our business improvement plan and the favorable market impacts seen this year tesoro generated  billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of this year after payment of  million of dividends on tesoro shares and  million on tllp public distributions yeartodate weve deployed this capital as follows we invested  million in high return capital projects in tesoro and tllp we repurchased approximately  million shares for  million at an average price of about  a share and we repaid  million of secured debt we remain committed to continuing to allocate capital to create longterm sustainable value for our shareholders we do this by focusing first on investing in our business improvements and high return capital projects we also want to continue to grow our dividend and remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in addition were continuing our efforts to drive tesoro and tllp towards investmentgrade credit ratings we paid down  million of secured debt at tesoro and currently have no outstanding secured borrowings on september t sp reaffirmed the credit ratings on both tesoro and tesoro logistics while placing both entities on a positive outlook given the transformative substantial improvements we have made in our base business coupled with portfolio enhancements we believe that were wellpositioned to achieve our longterm goal in investmentgrade credit rating this is important to both companies as it lowers the cost of borrowings allows for longer term borrowings and creates greater financial flexibility looking ahead you can find details of our planned throughput manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our fourth quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday we are confident in our ability to drive earnings growth for  and beyond as we focus on capturing value across our integrated business model and executing on our business improvement programs which we believe will create substantial shareholder value with that ill turn the call over to greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you steven and good morning everyone we had a record quarter of ebitda and earnings per share we attribute this to three things one strong operational execution we achieved  refinery utilization rate two record marketing volume supported by higher consumer demand and three capturing value through our business improvement programs also we returned  million to shareholders and paid down  million of debt as steven just stated yeartodate we returned a total of  million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase now turning to our operations our refining business delivered record results driven by high reliability high utilization and lower operating costs the tesoro index in the third quarter averaged over  per barrel which is one of the highest levels we have seen for a quarter the summer peak driving season led to an increase in us gasoline demand in fact us vehicle miles traveled in july increased  yearoveryear to  billion which is a record in california the economy remains strong and continues to improve yeartodate vehicle miles traveled grew  over last year this was aided by an expanding employment in the west coast we maintained a competitive position by optimize our operations to maximize gasoline production and running full crude rates at our los angeles refinery despite a planned turnaround utilization in our california region was in excess of  in the pacific northwest we optimized our crude slate to run higher levels of advantaged crude oil and substituted canadian crude oil for waterborne feedstocks in the midcontinent crack spreads remained strong our salt lake city refinery had a record throughput in the quarter we ran  barrels per day of crude oil including  barrels of waxy crude oil following the successful completion of the expansion project in the second quarter moving to our logistics segment tllp announced another strong quarter of growing volume across the business both our crude oil and natural gas gathering businesses continued to grow volumes in the face of a challenging commodity price environment our crude oil gathering volumes in the quarter were up  yearoveryear natural gas gathering volumes increased approximately  during the first nine months of the year for the first nine months of  the rockies natural gas business contributed  million of adjusted ebitda and is on track to contribute approximately  million of ebitda for the full year we are in the final stages of offering tesoro logistics the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and pipeline assets in los angeles we expect these assets to deliver annual ebitda to tllp in the range of  million to  million tllp expects to fund this transaction through an equal combination of debt and issuing units to tesoro the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter tllp expects to deliver  million to  million of ebitda for full year  and remains fully committed to the  billion ebitda target established for  we are committed to growing a fullservice logistics business for our focus on growing and optimizing our stable feebased business expanding our backlog of high return organic growth projects and pursuing thirdparty transactions and providing future dropdown opportunities shifting to our marketing segment ebitda for the quarter was a record  million this was the result of volume growth supported by strong consumer demand and our marketing integration which was  by the end of the quarter we are successfully executing our business improvement plans with strong contributions from our value chain optimization strategy this translates into increased and sustainable ebitda growth which is in excess of market gains yeartodate our business improvements are  million we delivered approximately  million in west coast improvements exceeding our goal of  million to  million for the full year for example we improved pipeline connections between the los angeles refinery sites crude oil optimization from the integration of the los angeles refinery sites and new cargo sharing between our california refineries we captured margin improvements of approximately  million compared to our full year goal of  million to  million with contributions from the completion of the second phase expansion of the waxy crude oil project at our salt lake city refinery improved crude blending processes at our mandan refinery and operating expense reductions we also delivered  million of logistics growth yeartodate against our target of  million to  million of logistics improvements for the full year we are on track to achieving our business improvement commitment of  million for this year to give you an update on our vancouver energy project we expect the washington state energy facility site evaluation council or efsec to release the draft environmental impact statement at the end of november we are committed to the proposed  barrel per day crude oil railtomarine terminal and remain very confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of washington and the west coast as we look forward we remain positive on our outlook the fourth quarter is typically a seasonally weaker demand period however crack spreads quartertodate have been higher than  with padd  gasoline demand up about  yearoveryear benefiting from increase in vehicle miles traveled while the current pace of high demand growth for clean products would be hard to maintain we believe demand growth will be between  to  in  which is still healthy and positive for our business we expect utilization in the fourth quarter to be between  and  this guidance includes planned maintenance in our california region we look forward to discussing our performance in  and outlining our plans for  at our analyst and investor day event on december  in new york city for additional details on this event please follow up with our investor relations team so let me conclude by saying that we have built a strong integrated refining logistics and marketing business and have a very competitive position on the west coast independent of the favorable market conditions we continue to efficiently optimize our assets across the value chain deliver on our commitments and create shareholder value now well take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you your first question comes from the line of neil mehta with goldman sachs please proceed neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co hey good morning greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning neil neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co so it was an outstanding quarter here at the retail segment just wanted to dive deeper there is the strength in the quarter really a function of the demand youre seeing in california and i know well get a little bit more clarity on this on december  but how are you thinking about different strategies to create incremental value out of your retailwholesale business gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah wed continue to improve our marketing operations over time and are realizing the benefits in addition to a very favorable market environment that you just stated and our primary focus is to one to continue to grow our marketing business and deliver higher integration than weve had in the past two we want to strengthen our portfolio of marketing assets that we believe we can create better value with and then third were going to strengthen our offering that we offer to customers and believe they will be able to deliver substantial value from that and as you said we will share our plans at the meeting we have in december neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co thanks greg and the second question i recognize there are sensitivities around this but you publicly expressed an interest in becoming larger in the midcontinent as you think about diversifying the portfolio in a scenario where us production is lower especially in the midcontinent do you think these differentials will be sustainably tighter and does that change the way you think about the potential value creation from getting larger in the midcontinent gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yes we continue to evaluate all the opportunities for the company as you would expect we look at all the drivers of how we create value and the market is one of those things that we take into consideration we dont see a material change that would alter our view on our desire to continue to grow the company in all aspects refining marketing and logistics and moving more east from our strong position on the west coast neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co thanks greg congrats on the quarter gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you neil operator your next question comes from the line of jeff dietert with simmons please proceed jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hey jeff jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international congratulations on the progress on moving towards investment grade i know youre not there yet but its obviously that you are making good progress i was hoping to ask about the business improvements especially on the logistics operation i think that was a big increase the  million relative to second quarter i believe was  million could you talk about the progress during the quarter and the outlook for hitting the target gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah jeff so our logistics as youre aware is really comprised of two things one is the growth as a result of the natural gas business acquisition so the cumulative impact of continuing to deliver on the business in the rockies primarily is like i said in my comments on target and will be on the high range of our expectations even in a pretty challenging commodity environment and then secondly continued growth really across the system through our efforts to better optimize the assets as well as organic growth projects coming on one of the key drivers for us is the ability to go out and identify good opportunities in the marketplace whether they be in the crude oil refined products or natural gas business and organically grow that business so its just a continuation of that jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international understand secondly if i could the market conditions in california have been favorable this year but if you could talk a little bit about what you think normalized margins might look like given the changing economic and demand environment for west coast margins or california refining margins gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah as we look at the west coast and we just look at the overall market fundamentals supply demand utilization rates in the refineries across the system and over time maybe a slow start going back a number of years after the financial crisis but over time that has just continued to improve as primarily the california economy has gotten a lot stronger so the fundamental drivers of the business specifically in california but the west coast in general as the way we look at it has continued to just be favorable to what drives our business and so our outlook over time is we will look at about a  to  improvement in our index next year which is primarily driven by just the stronger fundamental analysis of the market and thats not versus  jeff thats averages like a base of of  for our index and then we look at that off of  because of the unusual circumstances in  jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international sure thanks for your comments gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jeff operator your next question comes from the line of brad heffern with rbc please proceed bradley b heffern  rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions i guess gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi brad bradley b heffern  rbc capital markets llc following on on the previous question given the sort of apparent tightness in california gasoline regardless of whether torrance comes back online in the near future or not has it given you any second thoughts about the potential fcc decommissioning in la andor the mixed xylenes project and whether you actually want to be subtracting incremental gasoline volumes out of the california market gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer first let me just clarify on the work were doing in los angeles which we referred to as the integration and compliance project the purpose of the work there is one to integrate the two facilities as a result of physically connecting the two refineries were able to create more flexibility in the yield structure of the refinery so we can actually make the same amount of gasoline but we have more flexibility to supply the market with either diesel fuel or jet fuel if thats what the demand in the market is so that we have considerable flexibility there and thats what that project is driven by the work on our mixed xylenes project which is progressing extremely well basically allows us to produce a higher value product so what we are doing is making a higher value product relative to gasoline blending components and then selling that into a market thats very very attractive so long answer to your question but the answer is no we are still very committed to both of those projects because of what they deliver to the market and for the company bradley b heffern  rbc capital markets llc okay thanks for that clarification and then gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah bradley b heffern  rbc capital markets llc thinking about tesoro being one of the larger runners of bakken how do you think about bakken volumes potentially declining the impact on the system whether it still makes sense to be running bakken and anacortes given spread so tight with brent how do you see that affecting the system going forward gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think in the shortterm there have been factors that have caused the differentials to tighten up with some of the things going on in canada which has definitely put pressure on the differentials versus how they have been historically however as we look out over time even in a lower price environment we still see economic value to be able to move bakken to the west coast and achieve the benefits that we have always stated which primarily are driven by the yield improvements in the refineries as long as you can competitively price the crude in there and as weve seen how thats traded and there is a lot of pressure on prices or cost to move the crude to the west coast which will allow to maintain its competitiveness in our view bradley b heffern  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of doug leggate with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch thank you good morning everyone good morning greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi doug doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch greg clearly extraordinary cash flows in this environment just wondering what your latest thoughts are in terms of use of i think what youve described to me before as a tremendous windfall im thinking about pension we dont see you talk too much about that and perhaps not to put you in the spot but perhaps even some more innovative issues such as upstream integration and ive got a followup please gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah first let me – im going to ask steven to comment to you on how we use our free cash flow steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning doug so at a high level first our commitment to creating value through cash deployment hasnt changed we really start first by making sure that weve got funding for our business improvement our high return capital projects as we move beyond that we want to continue over time to grow the dividend and we want to be able to continue to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases as well when we look at the balance sheet really to your question about paying down debt or pension we like to have a approach to managing both in fact our pension plan we have been funding about  million a year every year above whats required to over time take that liability down and really kind of dollar cost average into it we find that to be a very effective approach so well continue to do that and continue to evaluate that and in terms of debt as we said in our remarks eliminating secured debt from the portfolio not only helps us with investment grade but having the leverage levels we do now weve got much more flexibility as we go forward to continue to invest in growth of the company whether that be kind of the business improvements we talk about or potential bolton acquisitions and those types of things gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer so i would just add to stevens comments doug just to maybe elaborate on other things its interesting in the environment that we find ourselves in now with from a price standpoint for crude oil and natural gas we are seeing lots of interesting opportunities across the whole value chain and we are actively looking at a number of things i would probably say that the ideas and the opportunities today are probably greater for us than they were – than when the prices were higher so it runs the whole gamut of all different possibilities and were very actively looking at a number of things doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch okay i appreciate the answers i guess the followups and its probably something as – maybe its a december issue but your latest given the strength of retail this quarter greg that what are your latest thoughts in terms of whether you are getting recognition for the value of those assets and what you might do to get greater recognition lets say and i will leave it there thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah our marketing business as i kind of stated a little bit earlier about kind of what were looking out there were very confident that we can continue to grow the contributions of marketing to our reintegrated value chain its an integral part of that business and we really want to strengthen the portfolio of different types of outlets that we have through our customers and so well talk more fully about our plans and our ideas going forward because we see very significant potential there to grow that business thanks doug doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch all right appreciate the time thank you operator your next question comes from the line of phil gresh with jpmorgan please proceed phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning first question just on the operating expense reduction progress that you talked about youve saved a lot yearoveryear on a dollar basis and a per barrel as well when you look ahead at the operating expense reduction potential is it more just to offset ongoing inflation or do you think that there is an ability to continue to cut obviously there has been some natural gas help this year as well gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we refer to it as improve rather than cut but we would say that we always target to offset the inflationary cost of doing business and our view is that in total the inflation in our business averages between  to  per year so we always try to offset that by creative ways to lower and improve our cost structure we also based upon benchmarking that believe that there are opportunities to drive other improvements in the business above and beyond the just the offsetting the inflationary costs and we are very focused on doing that and that will come over time over the next couple of years in that but we have made significant progress and having a very competitive cost position but there are additional opportunities phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc okay on the west coast improvements being above the high end of the range for the year two quarters or three quarters would you call that a timing function or are there more opportunities that you see there to continue to drive improvement gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yes continued delivery of our fundamental approach to drive improvements in the business there and we see additional opportunities which we will talk about in about  days or whenever it is in new york so its actually quite encouraging our ability to go in and deliver those improvements and keep delivering more of those phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc and if i can just sneak one last one on the capture rates they are pretty flattish sequentially q versus q you provided some helpful commentary last quarter just curious if you have anything you would offer up about how to think about capture rates this quarter any moving pieces that you think would matter to us steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah as we look at the fourth quarter based on the production plans we laid out and the costs in the current market environment we expect capture rates to be at or slightly above what we saw in the third quarter phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of sam margolin with cowen  co please proceed sam margolin  cowen  co llc good morning everybody how are you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer great sam sam margolin  cowen  co llc so there is a few dropdowns in the hopper it seems like and this next tranche of tllp transfers seems like its going to be a little more sponsor funded than they have in the past can you talk about the thought process there and specifically sort of what im getting at is is that evaluated as a use of capital for tesoro or is that more of a response to market conditions gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah ill let steven comment on that steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah its actually a combination of both i think on the one hand as you see the equity markets for the units in the mlp space its a very very volatile market right now and so its not a very attractive place right now to raise capital all that being said as tesoro we believe its a good investment for tesoro shareholders to own and continue to own shares and maybe even increase ownership in tllp over time but to balance that with as we drop these assets down generating cash for us to be able to bring back to tesoro and deploy for high value and so our approach as greg said in his prepared remarks of this being about  new debt and  tesoro taking equity we think accomplishes those objectives and then also we really want to see tllp move to investment grade its very important given how much growth there is there and how much you touch the debt markets to have the ability to take long duration borrowings to fund that growth and so by going  or in that range plus or minus around there allows us to naturally delever tllp as well sam margolin  cowen  co llc okay thanks so much and secondly on ma just to pick your brain a little bit location is a huge part of evaluating potential candidates for acquisition obviously where would – not just location in terms of crude access but also maybe in terms of market access where does kind of direct marketing capabilities or the opportunity for retail integration or already existing retail integration kind of rank on your evaluation process of looking at assets to potentially bring into the fold gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i mean fundamentally our business model is to be a highly integrated across the value chain weve been creating that we have more work to do and we will deliver higher levels of integration so whether it be refining marketing or logistics the opportunities that we look at and how we strategically think about how can we create value across that value chain would include all segments of the business and particularly driven by the complementary impact that they have on each other sam margolin  cowen  co llc all right thank you so much gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of paul cheng with barclays please proceed paul y cheng  barclays capital inc hey guys good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning paul paul y cheng  barclays capital inc a number of hopefully quick questions steven lets assume you have achieved on your investment grade any rough estimate how much is the interest saving or that crude purchase saving that you may be able to achieve because i presume that you no longer need to post the net  so any rough estimate on what is the benefit steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure good morning i think the most substantial benefit will be on the cost of debt within tllp and if you look at the current debt levels there roughly  billion and that will continue to grow as we grow the business and just based upon what we have looked at historically on an average basis of spreads that could be  basis points or  basis points so call it  million or  million a year and probably growing so thats a direct savings but probably equally important is the ability to have longer duration debt and have more stable access to the markets tesoro obviously carries some debt as well so i think about that  basis point number makes sense at the tesoro level and then youre right there will be commercial and operational savings although given how strong our financial performance is weve been working on that already so even absent investmentgrade weve been driving down lc costs and borrowing costs with suppliers there will be some there but it will be smaller than the interest savings paul y cheng  barclays capital inc i see and steven or greg do you guys have a cash return pl target steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think we do think about all of those collectively we think about driving total shareholder return and when you look at the levers to do that we think the biggest lever we can pull to create the best shareholder return is our business improvement organic growth programs really across the portfolio followed by smart and thoughtful acquisitions that bolt into that that either accelerate those growths or add to it and then in terms of the dividend we want to grow the dividend over time as the company grows and then when you have excess cash beyond those things buyback shares – and you have seen what we have done with buybacks and we would like to be able to continue to do all of those and so the key is to make sure that even in a market – neutral environment which we plan to that we can generate operational cash from the business to fund all of that and still naturally delever and yet have a stronger balance sheet as we do it those are the variables we think about paul so over time you look at the last five years the growth in just the value of the shares has substantially returned more relative value if you look at the three impacts of dividend share purchase and the stock we hope to keep driving all three of those collectively to be top in the industry paul y cheng  barclays capital inc greg the fourth quarter turnaround you said primarily accrued unit or it is conversion units in california for you guys gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah the fourth quarter turnaround is actually coming to completion here and it is primarily accrued unit paul y cheng  barclays capital inc okay and steven do you have an estimate what might have been the opportunity cost loss from the trend downturn in the third quarter steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president we actually came in about where we expected to so when we kind of set out our throughput rates – and actually they were actually down a little bit early compared – we dont quantify our lto per se but when we give you our guidance and our outlook we kind of take all of that into account and on the utilization side we actually came in a little bit favorable to what we thought going into the third quarter paul y cheng  barclays capital inc a final question greg i think last time i asked and you said that in order for you to keep the schedule to be on track for the la integration project and the mixed xylene you need to get the permit by probably the first half of next year any change in view that whether you still believe that you are progressing and that should be able to achieve or that you think we may see some delay gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer youre exactly right paul in our critical path on both the los angeles project and the mixed xylene project the isomerization project and vancouver energy permitting is in the critical path of every one of those projects and we are actively working every one of those permitting processes but i will tell you its very difficult permitting is incredibly challenging in that but right now everything that we see we stay on our plan but its not easy its very difficult paul y cheng  barclays capital inc okay thank you and just want to – i have a final point i want to say thank you that consolidating your presentation into your press release on the guidance saved us some headache because its too many presentation and perhaps we need doing the earning season so really helpful thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you paul take care steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you operator your next question comes from the line of edward westlake with credit suisse please proceed edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi there im going to start with sort of a philosophical question your business mix youve got free cash flow from your mature refining assets youve been operating well and thats created a strong sponsorship for the midstream growth and the retail obviously the cash flows for refining right now theyre good in other times theyre not so good so there is sort of a through cycle free cash flow which creates the strength for you to be aggressive in the midstream as you think about bolton acquisitions how do you think about that balance evolving are you worried that youll end up with too much sort of logistics growth assets that need external funding and not enough cash flow in the refining coal just some thoughts around that general balance gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer well the logistics assets are pretty much selffunding ed so theyre not tied if you look theyre almost completely standalone with the exception of when tesoro takes back equity so from a logistics standpoint were very confident we can continue to grow that business by our capability to both fund through debt equity both public and tesorobacked equity there and that model will continue to sustain itself the other part from the cash flow generated from refining as steven has said a couple of time today that one is we are very focused on investing in driving high reliability in our assets through our asset integrity programs and making very very good progress from that standpoint and that requires a certain amount of cash flow which isnt part of free cash flow but its important to recognize that that is a use of cash that we generated from refining operations but we believe with the improvements that weve driven in the refining business and the way that we operate the model that even in an environment that were to maybe not be as attractive as weve seen over the last few years well still have cash flow that will allow us to do the things that we need to do with the company and then a question is how we grow our marketing business we want to be able to grow our marketing business and that requires some cash also do that and well talk more about that at our analyst meeting edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker and then you mentioned bolton acquisitions i mean presumably those are all – are they midstream retail or do they include refining as well gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer when we talk about bolton acquisitions those are primarily in the marketing and logistics space theyre not – a bolton acquisition wouldnt be a acquisition of say a refinery we would consider that a little bit different edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker and then california you said youre going to raise your outlook for next year but i mean eventually efficiency gains are going to kick in to that market and that may impact margins longer term is this a signal of sort of a sustainable increase in margins or would just sort of for the next few years gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think on the west coast as we look at the drivers our view is that they are fundamental – the margin environment on the west coast is fundamentally supported by the supplydemand the economic environment on the west coast and that we see that kind of being able to sustain itself like that so we see that is a sustainable improvement in the environment edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker so sort of fiveyear timeframe gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah out in time i dont know three years five years  years the threat is not only in california but everywhere else is what happens to gasoline demand over time and then how are the reactions to gasoline demand if it declines over time our view is it will slightly decline going out over a longer timeframe like you said but not significantly edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker helpful and clear thanks gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of faisel khan with citigroup please proceed faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker hi good morning guys gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi faisel faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker hi is it possible for you to breakdown sort of the profitability from retail and marketing i mean it looks like this is sort of the strongest unit margin weve seen since you recast the numbers gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker so just trying to figure out sort of how this breaks down gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer well i mean youre exactly right i mean per unit profitability is extremely strong but im not sure if i understand what you mean break it down its strong  faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker well i guess theres the – sorry there is this retail component and then there is the marketing component and the retail fuel margin and then theres the wholesale of marketing margin which i think is – they can move in different directions gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer no we just talk about it as our overall aggregate refining margin and not the details i mean i think the point to make is that the aggregate margin from our marketing business was stronger than it has been faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker do those two businesses sort of move together in tandem or can they sometimes move in opposite directions gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i mean theyre driven by competitive market factors so they can move different way depending on whats going on in the marketplace faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay understood and then in terms of – you guys talked about you paid down roughly  million in debt is there a target of how much more youd like to pay down from here on out or are we sort of at the level you would like steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think in terms of the leverage levels were even beyond whats required for investmentgrade at tesoro the key here around this was to pay down secured debt and thats really what we wanted to accomplish by paying down the term loan but were well below whats required from a leverage perspective at tesoro so weve got the flexibility on the balance sheet now to execute the strategy and achieve investmentgrade at tllp in fact debt levels on an absolute basis will increase to support the growth and so the key with tllp is to continue to move closer and closer to that  billion of ebitda to have that kind of standalone size that warrants investmentgrade rating and so thats how i would think about it from a macro perspective faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay got it and as we think about sort of the movement of crude by rail to the west coast for you guys there was some commentary in the public domain about some of the canadian rail companies reducing their rates in order to bring more business back on their rail systems i just want to understand i mean is there any sort of benefit that that could accrue to you in terms of potentially lower costs are those negotiations that youve had or are going to have gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think faisel the answer to your question is that the competitive pressure being put on the distribution system not only in rail rates but loading rates unloading rates railcar rates and weve been saying for some time we felt like that would manifest into lower total cost to move crude in and youre right the canadians have publicly stated their effort to maintain to become even more competitive and we believe that that will happen here also we see it in pockets already and it will continue to drive a more competitive cost of supply to get the crude oil to the markets that were very confident will happen and believe thats one of the key drivers why vancouver energy will be very attractive faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thanks for the time appreciate it gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matthew blair with tudor pickering please proceed matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc hey good morning thanks for taking my question here steven i was wondering if you could provide any color on  capex looks like it moved up a little bit with a fairly large increase for tso but then a drop for tllp any further color there steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so first on the tesoro side as we moved through the year we identified really two areas where we saw opportunity to make additional investment about a third of that has to do with us driving some substantial improvements in our systems and our back office processes to make us – as weve grown the company to make us even more efficient in the back office but it particularly gives us ability to be more scalable as we grow the company with our administrative and back office processes the other twothirds are high return high payback projects that weve identified in refining as weve gone through the year that we really wanted to get on and execute because theyre very attractive capital projects so thats the increase in tesoro the decrease in tllp really is more of a timing issue than anything we have seen a couple of our projects move and we expect to execute a strong capital program in  which well share with you at investor day but thats the key driver there matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thanks then also steven can you provide us any sort of number on tesoros exposure to the low carbon fuel standard credits in california it looks like pricing for those credits is up to about  a credit in september its only  a credit earlier this year is there any way that we can have a sensitivity there to see the impact on tesoros ebitda from the change in these regulatory price credits steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah as we think about those types of required fees that were to pass on to consumers its just that were required to pass those along and we do that every day and so as we look at it we dont expect it to have a material impact on our business matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thanks and then a final question for greg i was curious if you had any thoughts on the salt lake refining market going forward on the product side we have a couple of refinery expansions coming through this year and then on the crude side weve seen a fall in – utah rig counts have fallen and utah crude production are we being set up here for structurally lower salt lake refining margins going forward and just any thoughts there would be helpful thanks steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so to answer your second question first there is no question that the waxy crude oil production has been significantly impacted by the price and i think to the best of my knowledge there are no rigs drilling for waxy crude oil in utah at this time so weve seen good supply of waxy crude oil in  and i think i mentioned in my comments that during the month of – during the third quarter excuse me we ran about  barrels a day of waxy crude oil in salt lake our plans for  is weve looked at sourcing crude and that were going to have good supplies of waxy crude oil but below what we would like to be able to run so weve sourced waxy crude oil but not to the level i mean we have capacity to run that weve demonstrated by our project far greater quantities of waxy crude oil than we ever have in the past but those arent going to be available so that definitely is going to be not as available as it has in the past but we have got good waxy crude oil supply for  on the capacity expansions in salt lake utah is a very seasonal – that region is a very seasonal market driven by high demand in the summer and less demand in the winter and from our standpoint because we drive a very integrated value chain were able to take our production and put it into our marketing outlets across the whole system which is going into the utah area and then going north and west up into the eastern part of washington and then down into our outlets in nevada so we have the capability to absorb our production into our system and thats the value of our integrated business and well have to see what happens with other changes out there over time i dont know well see what happens to those changes matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of evan calio with morgan stanley please proceed evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc hi yeah good morning guys gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hey evan evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc yeah i mean looking some followup to the prior strategic questions and maybe broader in scope i mean greg youve been a very strategic thinker as a ceo and youve made a series of attractive transactions in various different directions the upstream market to some extent the midstream market is under incredible stress your results speak for themselves i mean how do you see the opportunities that are – the strategic landscape or see the scope to be more transformative in this environment particularly given a reasonably optimistic outlook on refining your base margin business gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer probably all i can add to your question from other comments earlier evan is that i think as a company we take a step back and we look at the market where we are were very focused on how we can create value we understand what we need to do and how we can create value no matter what segment its in so whats more important to us is how we drive that integrated value because across that value chain the way we invest capital and also by the way we make decisions to optimize the assets its a fundamental driver of value creation for us so as we look at opportunities as i mentioned earlier to maybe – i cant remember if it was doug or someone that asked a question about the different opportunities – we are looking at unbelievable numbers of things to be able to say how do we strengthen our business position no matter where it is in that value chain and the opportunities are – theres some very very interesting opportunities some of them are small and some of them are larger in scale but we continue to look at those things and were fairly confident that over time well be able to capture and deliver very accretive opportunities for our shareholders evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc in your career  gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yes evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc yeah i mean but in your career with a broader perspective i mean have you seen theres this incredible dislocation right in terms of the upstream to the downstream and the changing of the business model of tesoro maybe if youve had any thoughts of maybe putting it in a broader historical context because it seems every deal comes down to the particulars it just seems as though a very opportunistic kind of market is what i would say gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i wouldnt disagree with you i think it is very opportunistic but you have to have ideas and then really dig into those ideas to see what the drivers are and how you can create value so probably not doing a very good job of answering your question its kind of a difficult question on an earnings call to talk about so evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc thats fair enough gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think it is i think its an interesting environment and how you look at things has to be considered over time not for today but over time and i think thats what the most important thing how do you think they fit into the structure of things that are going on that you can find either a niche or an edge there to create value over time and thats what we are trying to do evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc okay i appreciate your comments thanks gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of roger read with wells fargo please proceed roger d read  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi roger roger d read  wells fargo securities llc i guess quick question for you i dont think anybody has asked it i was wondering in california weve seen some discussions that the lcf is leading at least some or the other wholesale players to change their pricing structure i was wondering if you could give us any clarity on kind of the impacts –  to   to  here with the lcf and whether or not thats going to impact margins in any way for you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think just to be clear – and steven addressed this a little bit earlier – the regulatory environment in california thats placing additional cost as a result of emissions our view is are being passed on to the consumer in some places very clearly passed on and the money is turned over to the state by the way that we do that and our view is that where we are today and the things that are changing over time that that will continue to be the case theres some – some of those – i think when youre referring to the low carbon fuel standard there are actually some uncertainty from a regulatory standpoint of what actually is ultimately going to happen in that – not in the shortterm but probably in the little bit more in the intermediate term but in general i think the comment is that those additional emission costs are being borne by the consumer roger d read  wells fargo securities llc okay and kind of a change of direction here the comments in the press release on the strategic update – and i apologize if some of this has been asked before – but i just wanted to understand in terms of the logistics side of the business the  million and then there is commentary about the  million which is clearly being driven by the growth in the higher processing volumes and it sounds like just general movement of natural gas how much of that is sort of a market share gain growth that was already in place is there any risk of a lack of underlying growth in gas supply in that region that could impact your growth expectations in  and  gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah you have to look at all the – we have three primary segments in our logistics company we have our refined products segment which is the biggest part of the business and thats very stable and theres some opportunities in that part of the business our crude oil gathering and pipeline business has continued to grow and even in a difficult environment because of where our assets are and our ability to source crude from those assets into our refining system we see the potential to continue to grow and even expand that business into certain areas and then the natural gas business because its primarily concentrated in the rocky mountain area has been solid and we see solid performance there and the opportunities we see which steven alluded a little bit earlier in his comments about the capital program some of them being impacted by timing but the fundamental drivers are different than what we saw there so we see continued solid performance in our natural gas business roger d read  wells fargo securities llc so is it reasonable to assume you do have market share growth in that region then gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer definitely market share growth in the crude oil business maintaining our position in the natural gas business and as some of our customers have grown their production we maintain their – their growth drives our growth roger d read  wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of paul sankey with wolfe research please proceed paul sankey  wolfe research llc hi greg good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi paul how are you doing paul sankey  wolfe research llc fine thank you sir it sounds like youre doing good as well – doing well i should say greg we had an interesting conversation in january about the crude market and then about the positioning of the saudis  could you just give us your latest thoughts on things like the declines that we are likely to see in the bakken and how that will affect you you mentioned to me in january crude competition in the pacific basin has been potentially very impactful in this market share war environment id just be very interested by your latest views thanks gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer probably paul not a lot different i mean were seeing very competitive pricing of foreign crude oils into the west coast from the middle east and actually other places and our ability to take some different grades of crude which helps drive our business improvement opportunities has been very good were working on ways to continue to enhance the delivery costs of those crudes in that and making very good progress so the overall market environment is – there is no question whether the impact on prices has had an impact on some of the differentials but in general the ability to get the supply and take other types of crude oil into our system has worked out extremely well and our ability to get crude from the middle east is very attractive paul sankey  wolfe research llc i guess youre talking about tanker rates is that what youre referring to there gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer not just tanker rates but really what were trying to do to optimize the supply cost so once we get the crude into our system how we can take advantage of supply multiple refineries with crude from like the vlccs and things were doing to actually – to even – were working on some pretty creative things that we havent done yet on the west coast that will allow us to get even lower delivery costs into the system that well talk more about next year but really focused on how do you capture some cost savings by the actual delivery of the crude oil into our system regardless of that how the crude is priced in that paul sankey  wolfe research llc okay and then can you just – a followon will just be on rail economics and how the whole rail strategy now looks gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so for us its primarily bringing bakken crude oil to the west coast first were very confident that the pressure on the cost along that whole distribution system from loading to unloading and rail rates and railcar costs and all that are under a lot of pressure and they arent going to come down pretty significantly in our view over time here which will further improve the competitiveness specifically of moving bakken crude oil into the west coast and so how we think bakken crude oil will trade relative to the alternatives of primarily going to the middle part of the country or to the gulf coast the rail economics will still be supportive of taking it to the west coast paul sankey  wolfe research llc understood see you in december greg thanks gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks paul operator and at

yesterday we reported record quarterly earnings for tesoro second quarter  net earnings from continuing operations was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share for the second quarter of  ebitda for the second quarter was approximately  billion this was a record for the company and represents an increase of  from  million last year before discussing operating results id like to note a change in reporting within our refining and retail segments we have combined wholesale and retail operations into one segment now referred to as marketing which reflects our current business model and shows the combined value of the sales channels we use to reach our customers in our supplemental financial and operational information thats provided on our website you can find historical results reflecting the new reporting structure refining segments ebitda for the second quarter of  was  million an increase of  from  million a year ago this is primarily attributable to a significantly improved margin environment lower operating expenses and contributions from our business improvements our total refinery throughput for the quarter was  barrels a day or  utilization in april and may utilization was impacted by maintenance activities at our salt lake city and anacortes refineries and the restart of our martinez refinery following the labor disruptions we are pleased with how our assets operated towards the end of the quarter in june our overall utilization exceeded  the tesoro index was  per barrel in the second quarter of  with a realized gross refining margin of  a barrel or  of the tesoro index this compares to a realized gross refining margin of  per barrel or  of the tesoro index last year this quarters capture rate was impacted by various factors including our refinery downtime including the turnarounds i mentioned less advantaged crude oil differentials particularly in the midcontinent and running more intermediate feedstock in our california and pacific northwest refineries due to our turnarounds manufacturing costs in the second quarter of  decreased  per barrel over last year to  this decrease was primarily due to lower energy prices the logistics segment ebitda was  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million for the same period last year this represents an increase of approximately  this improvement was driven by the rockies natural gas business which delivered  million of ebitda and increased volumes in our crude oil gathering business the declared general partner distributions are approximately  million for the second quarter and  million through the first half of  the total general partner and limited partner distributions received by tesoro were about  million during the second quarter and  million for the first six months of the year the marketing segments ebitda was  million up  from  million in the second quarter of last year this is primarily a result of strong consumer demand as retail fuel volumes in the second quarter increased  over last year and are up  since the beginning of the year with the bulk of our planned turnarounds behind us were looking forward to running our refineries at high utilization rates in the second half of the year and capturing attractive market conditions driven by strong consumer demand we expect overall utilization rates in the third quarter to be between  and  and capture rates to improve compared to the second quarter we had strong cash generation in the second quarter and we expect this to continue in the third quarter we continue to deploy cash to create value for our shareholders and during the second quarter we returned more than  million to shareholders including the purchase of nearly  million shares for  million and payment of about  million in dividends currently we have  million remaining on our authorized  billion share repurchase program and well continue to buy back shares opportunistically we announced a dividend increase of approximately  to  per share from our current dividend we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately  billion an increase of more than  billion from the first quarter our sources and uses of cash can be found on the set of slides we published yesterday which also outline our second quarter results and third quarter outlook in the set of slides we provide details of our planned throughput manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our third quarter outlook were very pleased with our results in the second quarter and look forward to continuing to drive earnings growth in the third quarter and the rest of the year by focusing on running our refineries safely and reliably capturing value across our integrated business model executing on our business improvement programs and being financially disciplined this allows us to continue to grow the business and return cash to shareholders with that ill turn the call over to greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you steven we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter we achieved record levels of ebitda net income and eps and returned in excess of  million to shareholders also we delivered over  million in business improvements in the first half of the year turning to operations our refining business was supported by favorable economic factors declining energy prices improved product cracks and higher demand despite weaker crude oil differentials as a result the tesoro index in the second quarter averaged over  per barrel natural gas prices declined approximately  in the second quarter and this translated to lower energy costs for our refining operations us gasoline demand continues to benefit from the peak driving season additionally we see positive indicators in the marketplace from lower gasoline prices higher vehicle miles traveled and increased auto sales us vehicle miles traveled in may increased to  billion miles which is a record this was aided by an improving labor market and lower gasoline prices the california economy is strong and the market continues to improve for instance the unemployment rate in california declined to  in june vehicle miles traveled through june increased this year to approximately  billion miles up  from the same period last year and padd  gasoline demand increased by approximately  yeartodate and diesel demand improved by approximately  over last year now addressing our west coast operations our california refineries ran well in the second quarter and throughput was  barrels per day the martinez refinery resumed operations in april after maintenance activities and our los angeles refinery ran in excess of  utilization for the quarter the third quarter has continued to experience a very strong margin environment driven by growing gasoline demand we are optimizing our west coast operations to maximize gasoline production during this market and continue to maintain a very competitive position shifting to our midcontinent region our mandan refinery performed well in the second quarter and we completed the turnaround at our salt lake city refinery in addition to the turnaround we had unplanned maintenance activities that affected normal operations in salt lake during june this impacted our overall throughput increasing operating expenses per barrel and lowered gasoline production and capture rates in our midcontinent region this is now behind us and the salt lake city refinery is running at  capacity now moving to our logistics business tllp announced another strong quarter of earnings growth supported by increased volumes in its crude oil and natural gas gathering and processing operations we completed the integration of the rockies natural gas business in may and then closed the merger of qepm in july through the first half of the year the rockies natural gas business contributed  million of adjusted ebitda we anticipate the rockies natural gas business to contribute  million ebitda in  which is at the upper end of the range we announced when we acquired the business late last year we remain focused on strategic thirdparty opportunities and dropdowns to grow tllps portfolio of logistics assets around our western us footprint tesoro expects to offer tllp the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and pipeline assets in los angeles in the form of a dropdown in the fourth quarter we expect these assets to deliver annual ebitda to tllp in the range of  million to  million tllp now expects to deliver  million to  million of ebitda for full year  we are well on our way to delivering our  billion ebitda target by  we are very pleased with the growth prospects of our logistics business through the focus on growing and optimizing its stable feebased business expanding its backlog of high return organic growth projects and pursuing strategic thirdparty acquisitions and dropdown opportunities now to discuss our marketing business this segment contributed significantly to our performance for the first half of the year and we improved our marketing integration to  from  a year ago we have undertaken initiatives to realign our marketing business for instance we recently transitioned our companyowned operations to multisite operator model we also revised our segment presentation during the quarter further we are evaluating our longterm growth strategy for our marketing business and look forward to providing an update later this year now to provide you an update on our strategic projects through the first half of  we delivered  million of business improvements we remain confident in delivering on our commitment of approximately  million of yearoveryear earnings growth from tesorospecific projects we use tools like lean six sigma to improve operational effectiveness which contributed to the overall business improvements even though the first half of the year was challenging due to the labor disruption and maintenance activities our teams have stepped it up and delivered on these commitments for the first half of the year we delivered approximately  million in west coast improvements against our goal of  million to  million for the full year contributing to this improvement are benefits from our los angeles synergies including crude optimization optimization from sourcing new types of crude crude blending capabilities at the carson crude terminal that resulted in higher throughput volumes new cargo sharing between the martinez refinery and los angeles and improved pipeline connectivity between the los angeles refinery sites we have continued our efforts to increase the use of advantaged feedstocks through our system and delivered approximately  million in capturing margin improvements against our target of  million to  million for the full year this year we moved  million barrels of bakken crude oil to alaska in the second quarter bakken crude oil represented over  of the oil consumed by our midcontinent system we also delivered  million of logistics growth through the first half of the year putting us on track to deliver the  million to  million of logistics improvements for the full year as for an update on individual projects the washington state energy facility site evaluation council or efsec has indicated that the draft environmental impact statement for vancouver energy has been pushed back four months to the end of november we remain committed to the proposed  barrel per day crude oil to rail marine terminal we believe a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers several benefits to the state and the region including reducing americas dependence on foreign oil this project is designed to replace foreign imports with north american grades generate  billion in economic value to the local and regional economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions we believe that crude by rail will continue to play a vital role in delivering advantaged inland domestic crude to the west coast tesoro has made significant investments in infrastructure and enhanced rail cars to support this method of delivery in a safe and responsible way we continued to upgrade our crude oil rail fleet by adding  enhanced tank cars that exceed the new safety transport standards issued by the us department of transportation on may  of this year we have also completed the second phase of the salt lake city expansion project in the second quarter this expansion allows us to run additional waxy crude oil from the uinta basin increase our total capacity by about  barrels per day and run up to  barrels per day of waxy crude oil the salt lake city refinery is currently processing about  barrels per day of waxy crude oil as for our cash flow priorities we will continue to one invest in growth opportunities to further value creation two focus on external growth opportunities three maintain a competitive dividend and payout ratio four continue to strengthen the balance sheet and move towards investment grade and five return excess cash to shareholders as steven mentioned earlier let me conclude by saying that this quarters record performance underscores our ability to efficiently optimize our assets across the value chain leverage favorable market conditions and deliver on our commitments with a competitive position on the west coast and a strong focus on the growth of our logistics and marketing businesses we have built a solid foundation for continued value creation and with that well now take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator the first question comes from the line of jeff dietert simmons please proceed jeffery a dietert  simmons  company international good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffery a dietert  simmons  company international the second quarter earnings were all the more impressive given some of the downtime at salt lake and the ramp times at anacortes and martinez do you have an estimate on the ebitda or earnings opportunity loss due to these not running at full capacity for the duration of the quarter gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we dont have that available jeff but for salt lake city i think you could go back and compare yearonyear  to  and look at the difference in the margin environment and that would give you a very good approximation because you can see the lower throughput as we typically run at  utilization jeffery a dietert  simmons  company international good if you look at the tesoro refining index and a retail index theyre higher for july than i think any of the months that occurred during the second quarter you mentioned better margin capture with the benefit of higher refining utilization declining oil prices and the impact on secondary products lower rins prices it would appear that were off to a materially better third quarter number than what street estimates appear any comments on that gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think as we look forward to the third quarter id probably point out two or three things first as steven mentioned in his guidance we plan to run at between  and  utilization so if you just take the midpoint of his range of  and you look at what we ran in the second quarter because of what you mentioned regarding salt lake city and anacortes coming out of turnarounds and that we were at  so that equates to about  barrels a day of additional production in q versus q thats one thing secondly because of coming out of that turnaround and running feedstocks and things like that thats now cleared out of our system and so where we had a capture rate of  in q we expect it to be back more in the normal range for q and then finally we see the continuing market environment good demand in our marketing system our demand is continuing to stay strong going into the third quarter we just dont see anything out there thats going to change that in the short term and therefore with continued strong performance in marketing and logistics i think when you put it all together we see a very favorable outlook for q versus q jeffery a dietert  simmons  company international thanks for your comments greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jeff operator thank you your next question comes from the line of brad heffern rbc capital markets please proceed brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc morning everyone gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hello brad brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc greg obviously im sure youre aware of the reuters report last week suggesting that tesoro was looking at acquiring holly hollyfrontier are there any comments you can make around that and since the answer to that may be no can you just talk about your appetite for refining acquisitions and ma in general in the current environment gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah as youre very much aware brad its not appropriate to comment on rumors or speculation so well avoid that completely but what i will reaffirm is our strategic focus which has been the same for five years since ive been at tesoro we have five strategic priorities and one of those priorities is valuedriven growth and we fully intend to look for opportunities where we can acquire assets that fit in our business model and create value from those assets and weve been doing that for the last couple years we will continue to look for those opportunities we believe were good at capturing those opportunities and integrating them as we stated weve fully integrated qepm in less than six months into our business well capture all of the synergies from that business and its operating extremely well and i think the asset acquisition in southern california speaks for itself brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc okay thanks for that and then i was curious if you could provide more color on the movement of the wholesale business into the new marketing segment is the desire there to collect that ebitda together maybe supporting the plan that youre going to roll out for the retail business in the fall gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer let me ask steven to address your question brad steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah as we moved to the mso model on our retail business we created this marketing segment so you can see all of our customerfacing business in one place so thats the reporting change but as greg mentioned earlier the real focus is on creating value through our strategy being integrated you look at the performance of that business over the last couple years its improved dramatically in fact if you look at the last  months its generated over  million of ebitda on its own and as we look forward were going to lay out our strategy at the end of the year as gregs mentioned to create further value in the marketing segment brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc okay great and then if i could just sneak in one more im curious on those business improvement goals obviously good progress versus the targets there is there a benefit in those numbers from the record cracks on the west coast or are they based on more of a normalized crack environment thanks steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president there is no benefit at all from the margin environment operator thank you the next question comes from the line of evan calio from morgan stanley please proceed evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc hey good morning guys and strong results gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer morning evan evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc just a question on the buyback i mean clearly a big quarter here and i think you alluded to whats shaping up to be another one behind it but how should we think about a target ratio payout here i know youve been very active i think it was  of your net income in the quarter is that how you think about it or is it more flexible than that steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i dont think were as rigid as to saying that theres a payout target we want to have we want to continue to improve our total shareholder return but when we think about our overall capital allocation priorities were really committed and focused on driving more free cash flow growth so having high returns on our cash investments so being very disciplined there then second behind that we say we want to have about  million to  million of cash on our balance sheet and if you look at where we are at the end of the second quarter and youre comments on the third quarter about the business improving weve actually got flexibility there because weve got more cash at that point than the  million  million beyond those core elements our first priority is really to continue to fund these high growth investments the business improvement projects high growth capital and also ma beyond that we continue to grow our dividend we announced an  increase which follows a  increase in the first quarter and then we look to share repurchases and this year we bought back  million and were going to continue to buy back shares from the excess cash and then finally id say we do want to continue to move towards investment grade so putting some cash towards modest deleveraging over time makes sense as well so thats kind of how we view it across the spectrum evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc great and if i could a second greg maybe i know you addressed in your opening comments some of the trend and they extended into the third quarter but maybe just if i could get your longerterm view of how industry fundamentals are shaping up clearly theres even more recently theres been a broader acceptance a realization of a lower for longer or some level of lower for longer on the oil side as well as a resiliency of us production and the producer and i guess in that in a macro perspective were seeing refining startups internationally get kicked further to the right and particularly in china how do you feel about being in the industry for a long period of time how do feel about the refining fundamentals as we extend through  timeframe a little bit maybe longerterm view gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah its a good question evan the shorterterm view going out for the next  months to  months we believe the fundamentals are continuing to be very supportive particularly if as you mentioned with the – if crude oil stays in the lower price range that weve experienced we would see supportive demand especially in the united states may not see the same level of growth but thats probably not necessarily a bad thing if we can maintain the demand where its been and with some minor growth we would see that to lend itself to be very supportive for the industry and probably more importantly for our business if you take padd  and you just look at weve had continued growth out of the recession of the california economy in particular has improved growth in demand in that so the market is in a very favorable position and with our focus on being able to go out and drive the improvements and capture the synergies on the west coast we believe that were very well positioned to operate extremely well and deliver the products in that favorable market environment evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc and does the distillate gasoline relationship concern you and then the relatively diverging fundamentals and how they relate going forward gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer not from our standpoint because the things that weve been doing have allowed us to keep that flexibility to produce what the market needs whether it be gasoline or distillate which will be driven as you know by the the market will tell you what to produce so from our flexibility that were creating in our system were not impacted by it at all because we havent spent a lot of money to create that flexibility evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc i appreciate the comments guys thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks evan operator thank you the next question comes from the line of phil gresh jpmorgan please proceed phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi phil phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc a couple of followup questions first just on the last topic i guess im wondering if we think about the west coast specifically theres the demand factors you mentioned there there are supply factors as well if for example torrance were to restart tomorrow would your view of the tesoro index – would it be higher than it was at the december analyst day at this stage for the next year or two i think you had a  to  index and it feels like theres a lot of demand behind this as well gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer so let me just clarify one thing phil the index of  to  first was for our entire system not just california so just to be clear about that phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc yeah gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer but i think today looking forward versus last year where we were actually with a fair amount of uncertainty because of the environment we were in with falling prices and that and theres probably a little bit to followup on evans question and points that he tried to make it appears that the fundamentals are even more supportive so i think when you see us come out with our estimate for next year it will probably be higher from an index standpoint as we look forward from the markets so yeah we see that in a very positive way phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and just on the capture rate discussion do you happen to have what the june capture rates were or some way of calibrating a little bit more finely how you would think about capture versus the  given more of a full run rate and if i drill into that a little bit more obviously the midcon you highlighted some of the challenges there in the second quarter but are there any factors going on in the midcon that are more structural im thinking up in the mandan area with maybe slower diesel demand that would lead to slightly lower capture there maybe versus  gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so itd be probably june i dont have that number off the top of my head but i would say that june is probably a good indication for q from a capture standpoint and if you go back and look historically at what our captures been that will get you in the ballpark of what it is however you do have to recognize that capture will be down slightly because of the change in taking some of the marketing business and moving it into refining and then the change we talked about earlier in the year on how we account for the rin value now the rins have come down a lot since we talked about that earlier in the year but those two changes could probably take our capture down slightly in the midsingle digit percentage value so i guess as kind of an approximate value target around  as a lower level so i think that would give you a good idea of what capture would look like going forward phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc okay then just anything on the midcon specific gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer probably the biggest thing in the midcon is just the weaker bakken differential phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks a lot operator thank you the next question comes from the line of ed westlake credit suisse please proceed edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker great thanks and congrats it is clear q is going to be somewhat even stronger gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning ed edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker just a hypothetical if you owned any sp at one of your refineries and you blew it up and had to get a secondary one in and you needed to get a waiver what odds – you know the regulatory regime better than us – what odds would you put on getting that waiver i mean were all trying to work it out gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thats an absolutely unfair question ed edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i mean id just be you know honestly id just be speculating on that i dont think i can give you any better indication than anyone else on that edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker right okay maybe then ill move into a different area i mean obviously youve been quite aggressive on the mlp consolidation front i mean im sure youve observed that the mlp valuations are further coming in is the organization because youre still i guess digesting qepm or doing very well with that is the organization stretched to this point to do – to participate further in consolidation or is that still one of the levers that you think you could pull gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer actually we feel very good about qepm we did an excellent job of integrating it into our business the people that joined tesoro from qepm are an excellent addition to our organization their commitment and their strong technical and operating background fit exactly what we needed for our logistics business so we feel very very good about that and in less than six months its fully integrated into our business and running along and its been fantastic from that standpoint so were wellpositioned for other opportunities we mentioned briefly that we see significant organic growth opportunities even though it is a difficult environment with pricing prices for both gas and oil we continue to see good organic growth projects and working with customers across the areas where we do the business is still bearing a lot of fruit for us so were very optimistic from that standpoint we continue to look for opportunities to acquire assets that fit in that are good quality assets that fit our business model and well just see what happens as that goes forward edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah and then maybe if i could come back to the west coast just finally torrance i mean obviously at the margin – theres some gasoline thats not coming in it was a big unit so that does tip it but if torrance was fully running do you still think that wed be seeing stress in california because of the demand fundamentals that were witnessing gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think you have to as you know you have to go back in and look at the amount of gasoline thats been imported into padd  during the time that theyve had operating problems at that refinery and see what the net effect is that would give you an idea of what would happen because theres been a fair amount of imports into the area so its probably had some impact in the marketplace but i think the market is being fully supplied with all of the product that it needs edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks very much gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks ed operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of doug leggate bank of america please proceed doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch thanks good morning everybody congrats on a great quarter greg i wanted to pick your brain a little bit on your teaser on the retail business and obviously i knew you were going to give us details later in the year but i guess just as a big picture standpoint its being a strategic outlet for gasoline for you guys for quite a while obviously its grown in stature youve stepped that up over time is it something you see as strategic that you need to retain ownership of or is it the kind of thing you believe could stand on its own two feet like say as a standalone retail business or ipo spun out to investors for example gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think the first point thats more important than your question i think is that we believe its critical that we maintain that high integration in our refining and marketing business its a fundamental part of our business model so first thats extremely important the second part of your question is something that we need to look at and say how do you get the optimal contribution from that business with the amount of money that you deploy in that business as well as how you can capture returns on that and that is something we fully intend to answer here and well share with everyone before the end of the year doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch just a quick followup is it reasonable to assume that you could spin it out while still retaining the distribution rights if you like to the what i guess is predominantly a jobber market is that a fair assumption gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer doug i think just give us time to complete our work on it and well look at – as you know you know how we do things were going to look at every possible idea and were going to be focused on how do we create the maximum value for the owners of the company and then well – but well take what you just said and look at that with every other option that we can think of doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you my followup is really more about the structure of the gasoline market in california i guess given the strength that weve seen in margins obviously torrance has been offline and so on why do you think we havent seen a bigger stepup in imports into the region to calm things down if you like are there some structural barriers whether it be port facilities or things of that nature which i recall are predominantly owned by the local refineries or is there some other issue going on aside from the obvious strength in demand and ill leave it there thanks gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer first i think you need to look at the entire padd because as you know products gasoline diesel jet fuel moves freely along the whole west coast to the different markets and that so thats one thing secondly if you look at gasoline production it has been very strong in padd  during this period of time its been extremely strong because the market needs the gasoline and to the best of my knowledge everyone has met the demand for gasoline on the west coast we have not had any issues of supplying any of our customers at all and even earlier in the year when we had our operating challenges at the martinez refinery we still met all of our customer demand so im not aware of any shortages of not meeting the customer demand in that and i think the question on imports is a little bit to do with the market structure and pricing and when youre in a backwardated market like that it may present some challenges to get the gasoline into the market but the markets been absorbing imports without any problem doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch all right appreciate the answers thanks greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks doug operator thank you the next question comes from the line of neil mehta goldman sachs please proceed neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co good morning greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi neil neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co so greg i wanted to start off on the mlp here and youll be generating a lot of general partner cash flow thats going to start ticking up here and just your thoughts on whether it makes sense to monetize some of that gp and then also as a followup just your thoughts on the pacing of dropdowns into tllp as you think about your backlog gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah im going to ask steven to comment a little bit on the gp monetization then ill respond to your second question neil steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah very similar to gregs comments about how we create value on the marketing side we view the tllp business the same way were really focused on growing the business organically and through dropdowns to your point where we are in terms of the growth we see substantial cash flow growth already coming from the business and we expect it to continue beyond that whether theres opportunities to create value through other means we hope that the most value comes to our shareholders by just operating the business extremely well and growing it but over time if we feel that doesnt yield value well look at all the options that are out there on the financial side gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer on the second one neil regarding the dropdowns as you are very much aware that we announced in the second half of the year here we intend to do a dropdown and we talked about the scale of that dropdown and how the frequency of those dropdowns is for us predicated a little bit upon just the time that it takes to do all the work to get the dropdowns ready to happen in conjunction with everything else we have going on in the logistics business with our execution of our organic growth projects and were doing extensive business development with our customers to meet their needs out in the marketplace so that is one of the things that controls our dropdown schedule which is kind of gets us on one dropdown a year weve said that however this time weve done additional work to accelerate dropdowns that could happen in  because weve just been it just takes a lot of work to get those ready as so there is a chance we could do a little bit more dropdowns in  than we have in the past neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co all right great and then my followup on the ma point just philosophically greg you talk about taking a value approach when you think about ma are there regions of greater interest whether its the midcon versus the gulf coast versus elsewhere obviously there are market power constraints in padd  and then just if you could talk and flesh through some of those parameters that you define as a value creative transaction i think that would be helpful for framing the topic for investors gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer so we have been very clear for the last five years that our area of focus is from the middle part of the country to the west coast and pretty much staying out of the gulf coast and we believe that the best way that we create value is in our integrated business model between refining marketing and logistics and as youre very much aware that doesnt necessarily apply on the gulf coast like it does in the geographic area that i defined so weve stayed true to that geographic area for the last five years and right now i dont see us changing from that thats our focus we think we understand the business and the opportunities in that area and well continue to focus on that area what we believe from a value way to create values if we were to find opportunities they would be where we can capture opportunities from deploying the way we operate on a business that we would an asset that we would acquire for example what we did at carson we would intend to do the same thing we as the synergies that weve talked about and shared fairly transparently the types of synergies we would look for those opportunities that create value that are kind of embedded in the business which depend a lot upon how we operate which can include the commercial part of the business from a crude supply and product to the taking product out to the customers and then just as much as how we operate so wed have to find that type of embedded value in there and we believe that theres significant opportunities to be able to do that and then the other thing would be just being able to build out our business model that we believe there is a part of our value creation model that we would look to achieve neil s mehta  goldman sachs  co helpful color as always thanks guys gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks neil operator thank you the next question comes from the line of paul cheng barclays please proceed paul y cheng  barclays capital inc hey guys gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi paul paul y cheng  barclays capital inc greg on the ma if i could ask an additional question is there one or two financial metrics that are the most important when you consider ma transactions and if there are what are those and what is the minimum in those metrics that you would be looking for gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think paul we i think if you look over time most refining transactions that have occurred come into a pretty close range on a dcf basis so when we acquired carson you can go back and see the business on a discounted cash flow basis where that value is in there they stay in a relative a pretty tight range from the work that weve done on those so looking at opportunities wed be looking at them from a discounted cash flow basis and then the second thing would be which i hopefully tried to answer neils question is there embedded value in the business by the way that you operate or in some cases extend what we would try to do with our business model and so we do a pure grind out the numbers and see what type of value creation we can get through synergies and that based upon how – what we pay for the business paul y cheng  barclays capital inc and in your discounted cash flow analysis what is the discount rate you guys are using gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think over time if you look over the last little bit from the work weve done most transactions traded around  paul y cheng  barclays capital inc okay greg several of your major projects including the mixed xylene project carson and wilmington that youre going to shut down the fcc and expand the hydrocracker as well as build a tunnel to connect the two refinery physically do you already have all the required permits on the construction on those projects or are you still waiting for some gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer so on every project that we would consider kind of a major strategic effort by the company including vancouver energy the mixed xylene project that you mentioned paul the los angeles integration project every single project is in a different stage of the permitting process so we are moving all of those projects through the permitting process as we speak that is very critical from the implementation because youve seen some of the troubles that weve had with getting through the permitting process at vancouver energy we arent seeing those same issues at the other projects but they are in the permitting process paul y cheng  barclays capital inc can you share that when you think or that based on your – to get those two projects that the la carson integration and also that the mixed xylene to be on stream in  when you would need the permit to be acquired gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer you need the permits early end of this year early next year to stay on our schedule and right now were moving along that time line we dont see any issues at this stage but thats the critical milestone in the project paul y cheng  barclays capital inc and greg since the  publicly  on the qepm is there any plan to merge it into tllp so that you only have one logistic mlp gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer we completed that merger paul about the third week of july so qepm is fully merged into tllp it actually went very very smoothly and thats all behind us its done paul y cheng  barclays capital inc excellent a final one do you have a preliminary capex for  and also that hows your spring  turnaround schedule may look like gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think right now i dont have off the top of my head what we said at our analyst meeting in december of  with regards to  but thats probably a good ballpark number right now i just dont remember what that is were working our turnarounds right now were in our planning process for  going forward so its just too early to get an idea of what our turnaround schedule is paul y cheng  barclays capital inc greg can you at least tell us whether you think its going to be about normal or if its going to be heavier or lighter than normal or even that is too early to tell gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think a good indication would be kind of average paul i dont think from my recollection we have done some work to do some work on the turnarounds and that and i think that when we get into  youll see it comparable to  would be my guess paul y cheng  barclays capital inc thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yep operator thank you the next question comes from the line of sam margolin cowen  company please proceed sam margolin  cowen  co llc good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi sam sam margolin  cowen  co llc i just wanted to revisit this gasoline import topic quickly if you could educate us just a little bit on some of the dynamic at work here if – when these barrels land at port if theyre ready for market immediately or if they potentially require further processing within the california system so that theres in fact another constraint beyond just ship and port capacity as international refiners try to close that arp gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer you can import california gasoline and take it directly to the market it does not require further processing however people can import feedstocks to blend in to create additional gasoline and that – both of those may happen but your first question is you can take it directly to the market sam margolin  cowen  co llc okay thanks very much and then on just also revisiting the mlp valuation theme because i think this week its really come to the forefront for a lot of people on consolidation it seems like one of the constraints in the past has just been the spread between thirdparty ma transactions and the dropdown valuation so that the limited partners really had to fund a lot of the upfront consolidation costs but now as that gap closes how do you think about the tesoro parent company balance sheet and the role it might play in potential pure midstream acquisition opportunities outside a comparable transaction to say southern california two years ago but just tso parent in its current position with respect to thirdparty midstream assets and in consideration of how it affects the gp too if that has a tso parent steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i think your first question for our call was really around the fundamental valuations when you think about them from a thirdparty versus dropdown at the end of the day theyre really all thirdparty transactions if you take for example our qepm acquisition in the first year based upon the earnings run rate weve been able to achieve in the business its already down to about a  to  multiple and historically that had been the level at which we had dropdown assets too and so from our point of view theyre both very very attractive to lp unit holders as well as gp so thats kind of the first perspective to your second question how we think about dropping down assets greg described the pace at which weve talked about it it really is around – well drop down assets to continue to support the growth but its really about creating additional value being able to run those assets theres times where we could bring third parties into those assets as well and so when we look at the type of assets we bring down you can expect them to be very consistent with the type of assets weve dropped before and each year you have to look at the dynamics around valuation and so you know we still think that you can drop down these type of midstream assets at valuations that make sense today and theyre still accretive and valuable to lp unit holders and they still make sense for refining so we havent seen the shift off of that sam margolin  cowen  co llc okay and just out there in the ma market are we seeing assets close the gap to the dropdown valuation so that you can warehouse them in the parent company for a certain amount of time as you drop them down gradually should you see assets that look attractive to you outside the current tesoro footprint if that makes sense steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i think ultimately you want to use refining capital to grow refining and to the extent you can find other sources of capital to grow the nonrefining and marketing businesses youd look at that but yeah i think valuations – to your point over the last few years they havent really been supportive of that because theres been – theres really a strong bidask spread on those deals but i do think that thats an option well always look at is being able to warehouse it and drop it down you know particularly when its integrated with refining assets like our southern california acquisition that made a lot of sense created a lot of value sam margolin  cowen  co llc okay thanks so much steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of chi chow tudor pickering please proceed chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc hey thanks good morning can you hear me okay greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah a little bit of a buzz on your phone but yeah youre good chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay yeah i think im having problems here i guess on the midstream drop you mentioned to tllp youve mentioned the assets are in los angeles i was under the impression that tllp already held all the la assets are these still related to carson or do have something else in that region gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer no its part of the – both of wilmington we have more assets both around wilmington and carson that are distribution assets that fit into the system chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc is there more beyond what youve identified in the release today gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yes yes there is chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay and do you have any sort of ebitda estimate on whats still yet to come gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer chi not on those yet but there are others there so i dont know what it is exactly chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay okay at salt lake city regarding your expansion project there can you continue to process the aday of waxy crudes longer term or are you going to have to cut back on those volumes from your supplier once your competitor in that region starts up their expansion next year gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hey i think im not sure the competitor has much to do with the supply of waxy crude as it does whats going out in the uinta basin and theres no question that the drilling activity has dried up out in the uinta basin and thats going to have an impact on future availability of waxy crude oil so there was a fair amount of waxy crude oil being produced and used in a number of the salt lake city refineries and taken out of the region and so were working through that right now to get an indication of the availability of waxy crude oil going out looking further to see whats going to be available but we have flexibility to use other types of crudes and all that its just how the waxy crude oil prices into the system its just a little bit too early to see how thats going to shake out for  and beyond chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc do the economics on the project change much if you use nonwaxy crudes through the expansion gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer our project chi was built to run waxy crude oil that was the rationale for spending the amount of money that we did was to be able to process waxy crude oil as you can recall i think at about the time we were working on this if my memory serves me right we were around  barrels to  barrels a day and we basically said we were going to double that up to the  barrels it looks like were at about  barrels to  barrels a day and so there is no question that if two things happen – one if less waxy crude is available and two if the differentials come in in the short term that economics that originally were behind that project are not as attractive as they were when we spent the money chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thanks and then final question on vancouver do you read into anything on the states sentiment on the project by pushing their process back even further or is this just typical regulatory inefficiencies gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah from our view is its the way that the many different groups within the states that are involved in the efsec process are doing the work and it just doesnt work as you would both hope for it and like it to work if it was in a business you would probably get a different outcome versus going through the regulatory process but we do not read anything into it regarding their support or lack of support for it chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay great thanks greg i appreciate it gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks very much operator thank you the next question comes from paul sankey wolfe research please proceed paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc hi greg good morning gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer hi paul how are you doing paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc gosh man it feels like it should be friday for sure greg i assume youre having an analyst meeting in december right gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer that is correct paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc if we look back to last december i know the world was kind of already changing at that time but it still feels – if i listen and i have to obviously check through the transcript but it still feels that essentially what youre doing here is either reiterating or possibly raising kind of everything that you laid out at that meeting i just wanted – i know youll know the answer right off the top of your head is that broadly speaking true is there any elements of what you said in december that are drifting gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer no i think your recollection is right on we kind of today said that were going to go on the high end of the range of for example on the three areas that we targeted to create value last year we gave a range as we were developing our plans and today we feel confident that we will be on the high end of that range and so very very encouraging and furthermore what were looking at into  because we also gave a preliminary indication of value that we felt like we could contribute in  and weve already captured some opportunities that will start to bear fruit in  so im actually quite encouraged about the outlook for  from a overall what we do at tesoro to create value versus all of the discussions weve been having about the market paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc yeah and i know you well enough to know that if there was anything that was kind of going awry as regards to what youd laid out youd just tell us and so essentially what youre doing is youre – everything is towards the upper end of the range that you had laid out at that time gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think the only thing that doesnt look as attractive as what we thought last year was response to the last question that chi asked around salt lake city and part of our you know we spent a lot of money we spent a little bit less than  million to create the value at salt lake primarily driven by processing waxy crude oil and in the shortterm that doesnt look as attractive but everything else i think we feel very comfortable with paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc yeah and i guess what im driving at ultimately is that theres obviously been remarkable changes in the market a couple of things are obvious and one of them obviously benefits you which is the demand side has been strong but the differentials have collapsed the ngl story is horrendous and the mlp issue has been raised but youre still able to actually just sort of sail on with a raised outlook what have been the big – i mentioned demand obviously being a positive but it just strikes me that its kind of remarkable that youre able to do this given the scale of the changes an obvious one is the bakken differential being so much narrower could you just observe where the challenges lie if you like if there are indeed any gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i think on a broad scale from a logistics standpoint theres no question that outside the fringe areas of the bakken that youre seeing a lot less activity were fortunate that were right in the heart of the bakken and the types of customers we have to be able to both buy crude oil from as well as work with them to help lower their costs to get their crude oil to market through our logistics activities has been very very encouraging and maybe the number of opportunities may not be as great as it would have been in kind of the bull market that we were in for a while but its very encouraging that we see a lot of really good organic growth opportunities so from a logistics standpoint our organic growth portfolio continues to look very good and were – we have a number of opportunities both in north dakota and out in the rockies that were working and so were very very encouraged from that standpoint i think from a crude supply standpoint from a cost standpoint specifically around bakken crude oil weve always felt that the market would become very efficient and clear to the areas based upon the transportation costs to get there and its in some cases its taken time but as we look around whats going to happen in north dakota and how prices will set the differentials for bakken crude oil as that crude clears to the market were very confident that we can still take bakken crude oil and source it into our system exactly like we planned on it over the last few years as a – because we believe that the cost to move that crude oil are going to reflect that what the markets tell them they need to be to be able to compete in the marketplace and so thats kind of how we see it paul paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc yeah it makes perfect sense one delicate one just to roll – to finish it up the vancouver delay you mentioned is there any end in sight to that and i guess what youre telling me in the previous answer is that the vancouver economics still do make sense regardless of the – i mean right now it looks like the dips are within train economics basically gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think our view is is that the economics – we looked as you would expect we evaluate that all the time and we take a view on where the dips are where there are opportunities to reduce the cost set so were very confident that the movement of bakken crude oil to the west coast will continue to make sense over time and so we dont see any change there and our commitment to vancouver energy hasnt wavered from the very first day its just a very slow timeconsuming process that unfortunately most of it is outside of our control paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc yeah just to finish is there a deadline on the fact that its been delayed or is that just a – i dont know what kind of delaying tactic – is there any kind of gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer i wish there was paul benedict sankey  wolfe research llc yeah okay thanks greg gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of faisel khan citigroup please proceed faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker yeah good morning its faisel from citi gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning faisel faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker good morning greg just going back to steves comments around getting towards investment grade can that be accomplished just through deleveraging or does the asset base have to be more diversified in order to get there i thought that one of the hiccups or the issues that the rating agencies had was the concentration on the west coast but maybe im wrong gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah steven will address it steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah if you do read those credit reports they do focus on concentration on the west coast although i think weve demonstrated both through what weve done with transforming the business through the southern california acquisition the way weve run the integrated business model and the improvements weve made in the logistics business that being concentrated on the west coast is a good thing and we believe the rating agencies are paying attention to the improvement in performance and how we manage capital there and were able to continue to grow profitability and cash so we feel very very good about the business profile and in terms of the balance sheet our credit metrics and all that because of the business growth have moved very very close to investment grade so in terms of the debt side of the balance sheet we think theres only a need for very modest type deleveraging a few hundred million type of thing its not a billion dollars and so we think that we can both grow into it through our earnings growth and over time some modest debt repayment will get us there faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay got you and on the marketing side the restatement here i just want to make sure i understand this so the wholesale business its the entire spottorack business thats been restated out of refining and put into retail is that what im seeing here on the restatement gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer no thats a little bit too broad of a definition because in there we do like a lot of unbranded just taking product to the over the racks when we have excess product that is not included in there it is business thats committed to customers is what the wholesale business is so where we have contracts with specific customers thats what the wholesale part of the business is in addition to our retail business faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay so its only racktoretail then theres no – the spottorack is still sort of within the refining segment gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so well let me just clarify that faisel so initially it was our retail marketing business where we had our brand that was given – that customers used a brand that either tesoro owns or we have the rights to offer to customers that was our retail business so the arco business the tesoro business the usa some shell some exxon and some mobil that was the legacy retail segment that reported externally today in addition to that we have customers that do not use our brand but that have contracts to buy business from us on sometimes longterm contracts and sometimes a little bit shorter term but its that business thats in there where we just go to the market and sell unbranded product over the rack it does not include that business faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay okay got it and is there any breakdown in the quarter how much was the difference between the way you guys used to report before versus the way you guys report today in terms of the wholesale versus the retail steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah we put it in our supplemental financial information and what weve done there is weve actually gone back and backcasted back to  by quarter the way the segments would have looked and so you can compare that to what youve seen previously and give you a delta in   it was in the neighborhood of about  million a year faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay okay that makes sense thank you the next on the dropdown you guys are talking about in tllp given that the gp cash flow is a larger cut of the cash flow stream how do you guys think about the pricing in the past weve seen you drop down the assets at a certain multiple but now that the gp cash flow is higher i guess we would normally think that the multiple would have to be lower in order to accommodate for that cash flow stream i just want to understand philosophically how youre thinking about it steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i think that the first and foremost is to make sure that the overall deal economics create a lot of value for lp unit holders and the gp unit holder and so it comes down to the quality of the assets and the sustainability of the earnings that are in there and the required capital to maintain them so i think that drives  of it is good quality assets being dropped down but we do look at because of the way the gp and lp structures work to make sure that both lp unit holders and gp unit holders both value greatly from these transactions so well look at all mechanisms to do that faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay last question from me it sounded like on the call you guys were talking about there was some headwinds during the quarter to the capture rate but it sounds like all those issues have been resolved is it fair to say that as we sit here in the third quarter that the ability for you to capture more of the margin is better today than it was in the second quarter steven m sterin  chief financial officer  executive vice president thats correct faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay great thanks guys i appreciate the time gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks faisel operator the next question comes from the line of paul cheng barclays please proceed paul y cheng  barclays capital inc hey greg just a quick followup on the vancouver is there a point if they continue to delay and push it forward that you would say okay that weve been waiting long enough that were going to look for an alternative option instead of say going efsec is there a red line inside the company that you guys are contemplating or that you would be looking at concurrently and if theres an alternative option then what that option may look like gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer well i was going to say something about red lines but id better not so right now paul i mean were absolutely committed to vancouver energy and were very confident that – the efsec process looks at the actual permitting process in that the overall impact of what this does to the community to the state to the supply of this type of crude oil to the west coast to the improvements in lowering carbon intensity of crude oil thats produced in the united states made into products and sold on the west coast that are all positive we just believe when all of thats taken into consideration that therell be support that therell be very strong support for the project so we dont see anything at this stage that would ever tell us not to keep pursuing the project unless we learn something down the road that we dont know today theres nothing that tells us we wont continue to pursue this paul y cheng  barclays capital inc all right a final question do you have a number you can share inside your network what is the samestore sales in the third quarter so far and the yearoveryear growth gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer we talked about during the discussion earlier that our marketing growth yearonyear was up around  during q versus last year and we said that its continuing at that pace so far whatever we are five weeks into the third quarter we are experiencing that same pace of growth paul y cheng  barclays capital inc thank you gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks paul thank you everyone operator thank you and the next question comes from faisel khan citigroup please proceed faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker sorry guys just one last question just want to know in the segment data that the pop exposure and keephold exposure that used to be at the midstream business at qep where does that sit now does that sit within refining or marketing or is it within the corporate segment gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer no the agreement between tesoro and tesoro logistics to take the commodity exposure off of the ngls is done in our refining segment and as we said its immaterial to the company faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay gotcha thanks a lot appreciate that gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks faisel gregory james goff  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you everyone appreciate it operator thank you ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions so thank you for your participation in todays conference this concludes the
