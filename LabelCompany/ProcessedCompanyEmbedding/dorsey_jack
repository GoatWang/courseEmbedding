livestreaming and new products haven’t revived growth by sarah frier  october   a few days before twitter’s sept  board meeting as the company’s finance team readied a presentation it received conflicting directions on a crucial question should their slides reflect twitter’s prospects as an independent company or delve into the benefits of getting acquired jack dorsey twitter’s chief executive officer argued that the yearold company should remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video people familiar with the discussions said ev williams a former ceo who has a history of clashing with dorsey was in favor of exploring a sale other directors agreed they had a fiduciary duty to consider that option the board ultimately decided to consider takeover prospects after getting an expression of interest from a potential acquirer which led it to hire goldman sachs and allen  co to evaluate possible bids after pitching the san franciscobased social network the bankers received inquiries from suitors which so far include disney and salesforce with google also weighing a potential bid this week the board is consulting with other outside advisers on how to deal with the internal disagreement over a possible sale according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the process is private formal bids could come within a couple of weeks–or not at all though its fate is in flux one thing is clear a year after he officially took back the reins as ceo jack dorsey has either ceded or lost at least some control over the future of the company he helped create on the board he may be overruled by fellow directors on the future of twitter as an independent company within his management team he’s largely delegated command of twitter’s strategy to chief financial officer anthony noto and among advertisers twitter’s fortunes are being constrained by its stagnant user numbers which dorsey’s product changes have failed to significantly boost and by growing concern about harassment and abuse on its service “the lack of growth in users and engagement underscore that jack’s initiatives thus far haven’t really been effective” said robert peck an analyst at suntrust robinson humphrey inc “if this whole ‘live’ idea doesn’t work then what is it that gets twitter to grow” twitter spokeswoman kristin binns declined to comment on the board’s discussions about a potential sale process asked to provide perspective on dorsey’s progress binns said in an email that the ceo has met the goals he outlined a year ago and made significant strides in each of his priorities for the company the company has been rolling out products faster than ever she noted and has boosted engagement through enhancements to the timeline such as showing people the most relevant tweets first she also cited the company’s advancements and partnerships in live video streaming including deals to broadcast nfl games and presidential debates his leadership style in the past year at twitter has been socratic as twitter’s first ceo dorsey was initially known as a detailobsessed micromanager he was ousted in  then brought back to twitter–which was having trouble attracting new users–to apply vision and direction with the kind of authority that only a founder can bring but dorsey hasn’t seemed interested in being the sole authority on twitter’s future according to insiders while he was away from twitter he built a creditcard reader company square inc and learned the importance of trusting others with strategic decisions his leadership style in the past year at twitter has been socratic not prescriptive these people said he’ll ask openended questions to spark debate like “are we preventing people from expressing themselves fully with our character tweet limit what would a different solution look like“ the discussions eventually lead to solutions like twitter’s move last month to exclude photos and attachments from a tweet’s character total but the process takes time and that passive contemplative style created a void in management that noto has stepped in to fill people said “noto has been just as responsible just as influential at the company as jack” said mark mahaney an analyst at rbc capital markets “he’s been unusually active as a cfo” dorseys passive contemplative style created a void in management that noto has stepped in to fill photographer scott olsongetty images earlier this year noto told twitter’s other senior staff that he intended to bid for the rights to stream  thursday night national football league games he wasn’t expecting to win but he wanted to try according to people familiar with the conversations noto who is a former cfo of the nfl did win–for the bargain price of  million lower than what others were willing to pay that kicked off a string of other deals in sports politics and entertainment centered on making twitter accessible to a wider audience through live video they can watch for free the first nfl game drew  million users and the next one got  million hinting at the potential for a growing audience according to the company it’s not that dorsey has been uninvolved on the contrary his employees say he answers emails so quickly that it’s difficult to imagine how he has the time given that he’s also still ceo of square during his first month at twitter he cut  percent of the workforce he recruited new board members like debra lee the ceo of bet and hugh johnston the cfo of pepsico to add executive experience he’s helped the strategy by providing a longterm perspective on the business and focused on a single concept to help drive it live but if dorsey is the introverted deep thinker noto is the doer he’s the highenergy cheerleader who has cut through indecision at the company and rallied twitter’s employees around a future of live video streaming boosted by licensing of premium content twitter has partnered with bloomberg lp to stream some bloomberg tv shows as well as the presidential debates it’s unusual for a company’s cfo to be leading its product vision and even rarer at a technology company twitter’s engineers have long grappled with how to make the service easier to use cycling through six heads of product in six years noto’s dealmaking provided them with a unique solution to make video an entry point to the twitter experience twitter recently released streaming applications for apple tv xbox and amazon fire tv letting viewers pick content that streams alongside related tweets and sidestepping the need for people to create an account and decide who to follow–previously a cumbersome prerequisite of using twitter twitter hired noto in  with more than  million in stock options following a career in banking at goldman sachs where he helped twitter go public it’s unclear whether noto supports a twitter sale but he did recently retain goldman to look at other options like selling off assets besides the core business according to people familiar noto’s presence at the company has long been a comfort to investors with many figuring that if it came time to sell he would know how to get it done ev williams a former ceo who has a history of clashing with dorsey was in favor of exploring a sale photographer david paul morrisbloomberg even as the company gains ground in streaming dorsey is being forced to reconsider twitter’s future in part because its lack of user growth us average monthly users have hovered around  million for six quarters revenue which more than doubled in  is projected to rise just  percent this year and to slow further next year advertisers see potential in the company’s live video strategy but they’re also being wooed by photo and videosharing app snapchat and facebook’s instagram which has recently become more advertiserfriendly at the time of twitter’s  initial public offering those services weren’t close competitors now they both have larger daily audiences than twitter “twitter budgets have slowly gone down and down and down” said james douglas who consults with advertisers on their spending as executive director of social media for society an agency within ipg mediabrands whose clients include cocacola and red bull “it’s kind of hard to compel clients who had an experience with twitter that wasn’t good or have the perception that twitter’s audience is declining everyone has questions for them” douglas said tom buontempo the president of attention the social arm of ad firm kbs said he’s seen the trend worsen in recent months it’s all a matter of where people are spending their time he said “i’m starting to hear more clients consider whether or not they need to be on twitter at all” attention’s clients include bmw mattel and lincoln financial though buontempo wouldn’t say who is pulling back when twitter’s ceo search committee was looking to replace dick costolo in  they made calls to major investors asking for input and floating dorsey’s name as a contender some investors expressed their skepticism given that dorsey was already a large influence on costolo and could already impact the company’s direction through his executive chairman role perhaps there is more to come but some investors havent been willing to wait still one year ago this week twitter’s board was jubilant on a conference call announcing the decision to bring back dorsey permanently dorsey would “help us achieve what we see as a massive opportunity to grow the company” peter currie who helped lead the search and has since left the board said at the time “the board has been pleased and impressed with the strategy vision and alignment around goals coming from the twitter teams these last few months and there is much more the world hasn’t seen just yet” perhaps there is more to come but some investors haven’t been willing to wait twitter’s stock had dropped about  percent this year before reports began to surface about the company considering a sale even one of its largest and earliest investors chris sacca a vocal critic of twitter’s strategy under costolo and proponent of bringing back dorsey has sold a large part of his stake he told bloomberg tv on tuesday brad slingerlend who manages the global technology fund for janus capital group holds facebook google amazon and apple–but sold twitter after dorsey took over social networking he said is a business that depends on a network effect to generate growth if the network’s momentum starts to ebb it’s difficult to recover the bestcase scenario slingerlend said would be an acquisition by disney as twitter becomes more of a media company the two make for a good fit he said and disney’s ceo bob iger has experience bringing a brand back to life “jack is a good entrepreneur” slingerlend said “but twitter needs a turnaround ceo and that’s a completely different job” –with alex sherman editor jillian ward   jack

menu fortunecom subscribe by erin griffith illustration by eddie guy for fortune march    am edt how the mediajuggernautturnedtrainwreck is getting back on track after a rough two years in late january the tweeps needed a kumbaya moment and jack dorsey knew exactly how to give it to them donning a ball cap white tshirt and zippered neonorange hightops twitter’s cofounderturnedceoturnedpariahturnedexecutivechairmanturnedinterimceoturnedpermanentceo stepped onto a small stage at the weekly allhands meeting in twitter’s san francisco headquarters the week had been hard he admitted to a standingroomonly crowd of over  employees but he had a plan to fix everything the previous sunday jan  news had leaked that four of twitter’s top executives were leaving forcing dorsey to tweet a terse defensive response from the outside it looked as if the social media service was bleeding talent and fumbling to react in reality the shakeup was part of dorsey’s plan a plan that he now explained in more detail to his coworkers the departures he said were all part of twitter’s turning a page the meeting quickly became a sort of corporate pep rally rankandfile engineers and salespeople stepped up to the mike effusively telling one another why they work at twitter “because this product saved my life” and “because one tweet can change the world” and “because i’ve never believed in a mission more” anthony noto twitter’s exbanker cfo declared “it’s just us” echoing earlier comments—“no one is coming to save us”—from a staffwide memo that may sound like an odd rallying cry but employees latched onto the underdog message there was cheering there was tweeting oneteam lovewhereyouwork itsjustus “it was a moment of jack at his best” says senior director of corporate development and strategy jessica verrilli whom dorsey recently lured back to the company just a few months after she had left “it was electrifying” jack dorsey has streamlined twitter’s product team since officially returning as ceo in octoberyana paskova—bloomberg via getty images a jolt of electricity is exactly what twitter needs with stalled user growth a stock trading at  below its ipo level and a revolving door of executives the past two years have been among the worst in twitter’s history and all the company’s missteps seemed to play out in public—especially on twitter itself where power users of the service pounced on every shortcoming and continually predicted its demise “they’ve run out of eyes to be black” says chris sacca an early investor who still holds a substantial stake “this is a company that has taken every punch possible and is still standing” sacca believes twitter’s worst days are behind it most vexing is the fact that twitter which turns  years old on march  is still grappling with the existential question that’s plagued its existence throughout what is twitter just setting up my twttr— jack dorsey jack march   five years ago dorsey didn’t think the company needed an answer “it’s different things to different people at different times” he said at a conference the ambiguity has taken its toll leading to sluggish innovation strategy whiplash and internal dysfunction all of which intensified—along with the scrutiny—after twitter went public in november  worst of all in a tech culture where constant evolution and perfection of “product” is the gold standard twitter’s product development had become a chaotic crazyballoons catastrophe moving in every direction but forward in october a few months after former chief dick costolo resigned dorsey officially became twitter’s ceo he’s simultaneously running square the payments company he founded and took public last year in february he finally answered that pesky existential question according to dorsey “twitter is live live commentary live connections live conversations” already dorsey is encouraging bold changes to twitter’s most iconic features which coo adam bain says is critical to twitter’s future success “part of why i knew it could only be jack was because the product moves we knew we needed to make could only be done by the founder and the inventor of the product” he says twitter did not make dorsey available for an interview but conversations with advertisers investors and  current and former employees reveal confidence in him most of them—even the bitter ones—said some version of “if anyone can do it it’s jack” the question is whether anyone can do it twitter’s product has insinuated itself into the fabric of international discussion and the company earned  billion in revenue in  with a net loss of  million but because twitter failed to take that success to the next level it hasn’t met the lofty expectations the media tech and financial worlds had for it and that it had for itself twitter has  million monthly active users—impressive but well short of the billionuser milestone that separates a digitalmedia superpower from an alsoran alphabet owns seven billionuser products facebook has two three years ago at its ipo most observers thought twitter could get to the billionuser mark too but since then the company’s product has stagnated while competitors—facebook instagram and snapchat—have continually made their services better and more essential to their users incredible singular events happen on twitter from kanye west’s wild rants to donald trump’s latest bullying but the best of twitter gets embedded around the web analyzed on tv and even quoted in stodgy old newspapers so despite twitter’s  brand awareness many regular people—those who aren’t influencers in media finance activism sports politics or pop culture—have decided they don’t need the app investors in turn have decided twitter is worth a mere  billion—a far cry from alphabet’s  billion market capitalization and facebook’s  billion twitter’s management led by the wouldbe superman dorsey isn’t giving up but this could be the company’s last chance to get it right in  dick costolo twitter’s recently promoted ceo decided that twitter should make  million that year from a product focusing on live events like concerts and big football games there was just one problem not only did the events product not exist but the vision of what it might look like didn’t exist all twitter had was a catchy concept and a revenue target twitter’s product managers had to scramble to create something advertisers might pay  million for rather than build something twitter’s users might want it was revenue first product second epitomizing everything that was wrong with twitter’s strategy according to employees familiar with the project and to no one’s surprise the  million didn’t materialize that year because no “events product” shipped it’s hard to overstate how much companies like twitter live and die by their products—the apps and websites they build and their constant improvements to those offerings it’s critical according to silicon valley wisdom that the products have a clearly defined “vision” even more critically products must emphasize user experience over revenue if a company gets too greedy and ignores what users want that company is dead users are a fickle bunch just ask myspace former ceo dick costolo turned twitter into a revenuegenerating enterprise but stumbled on product developmentfrancois gdurand—getty images twitter’s culture leftover from playing catchup to its own early runaway growth has been more reactive than visionary its style has been to build things “the crafty hacky way” as a former executive puts it that adds to twitter’s charm but it doesn’t motivate product managers to dream up ambitious longterm projects many of twitter’s most innovative features including the hashtag reply and retweet were actually invented by users “we always had a long list of stuff that we were slogging through and we would only look quarter ahead to quarter ahead to quarter ahead” says coo bain a ½year veteran of twitter’s sales side as ceo costolo had strengths although being a “product visionary” wasn’t one of them he was wellversed in teaching managers how to manage and he pulled off something twitter’s previous two ceos including dorsey had not bringing an air of relative stability to the freewheeling fail whaling startup he whipped twitter into a revenuegenerating business taking it public in  with a  firstday stock pop that drove its valuation to  billion he also took a bold stab at the “what is twitter” question in the company’s public offering document with four simple words public realtime conversational and distributed but even during the successful ipo investor concerns about slowing user growth lurked beneath the surface eager to show he could jumpstart growth costolo put his no  coo ali rowghani in charge of twitter’s product division a glowing wall street journal profile dubbed rowghani “twitter’s mr fixit” rowghani found a disorganized overstaffed product and engineering team that couldn’t agree on anything every team seemed to overlap with every other team because no matter the name “growth” or “timeline” say they were all essentially working on the same thing the tweet a rule that any team could test a new feature on  of twitter’s users was meant to spur creativity but soon twitter was running more than  tests at once with little coordination “it quickly got to the point where it was like throwing darts on a board rather than testing a hypothesis” a former executive says what’s more twitter continued to grapple with its identity within six months of its ipo the company’s biggest product initiatives no longer matched costolo’s “public realtime conversational and distributed” description a feature called “while you were away” showed users old tweets they might have missed—the opposite of realtime updates to “direct messages” twitter’s oneonone messaging service were by definition not public meanwhile instagram and snapchat were grabbing attention with their own public conversational and occasionally realtime products taking market share that should have been twitter’s by may  twitter’s stock price had been slashed by more than half from its january high and costolo was under pressure he took control of product development back from rowghani prompting his coo to resign on june   looking back many insiders point to that day exactly a year before costolo stepped down as ceo as the clearest sign costolo was doomed “that was the moment everyone realized dick was running scared looking over his shoulder” a former executive says costolo did not respond to multiple requests for comment high turnover and regime changes plagued twitter through the next  months the company lost two vice presidents of engineering a product head a media head a director of product and a senior director of engineering see timeline above the lack of continuity only intensified the shortterm thinking among twitter’s product builders any progress on new features “would be blown up every six months” by another reorganization says a former executive the dysfunction reached an apex in may  when sacca the early investor published a series of blog posts longer than the us constitution outlining the company’s shortcomings investor cries for costolo’s head intensified not helped by twitter’s june  shareholder meeting where he reiterated his latest vision “to connect everyone to their world” att once used a similar mission statement a week later costolo stepped down it was his idea he insisted in interviews things at twitter were just fine in a statement that bewildered anyone who had been following along costolo said “we have great leaders who work well together and a clear strategy” since then at least  highlevel managers and executives have left and the company’s tactics have completely changed jack dorsey has said twitter should be “the most powerful microphone in the world” lately it’s been a powerful microphone for people to complain about twitter when in january twitter changed its starshaped “favorite” button into a heart users loudly protested even extweep vivian schiller tweeted “i don’t get the point of this” aweiss i know i know im just grumpy because i dont get the point of this— vivian schiller vivian november   when the twittersphere learned that the service would expand its iconic character count the vitriol was so strong that dorsey had to tweet a clarification on news that twitter would use a facebooklike algorithm to sort its fastmoving stream the internet boiled over in rage elevating the hashtag riptwitter to a trending topic passionate users will always react passionately to big changes but the real takeaway twitter executives will tell you is the speed at which twitter is introducing these changes in the past twitter’s product managers would debate for ages over barely noticeable tweaks but in recent weeks “we’re shipping we’re shipping we’re shipping” says verrilli the corporate development director “that is the energy and the momentum that characterizes the company right now” the other takeaway is that the changes appear to be working twitter says the heart button got  more use in its first week than the star button averaged since it was invented before it could ship ship ship twitter had to clean house in october dorsey laid off  of its person staff “some of the people that got laid off were amazing” says a former product manager “but you can’t have a bunch of people doing the same job” then dorsey had to fix twitter’s broken product process he borrowed a strategy from apple by appointing a “dri” directly responsible individual in charge of decisions for each product he also insisted that designers be included earlier in the development process dorsey killed features that he believes focus on boosting shortterm metrics without adding much to the overall twitter experience like a “follow” button that appeared on individual tweets his message to employees is “think bolder” at a january executive retreat he handed out copies of the book mindset the new psychology of success which includes motivational if vague lines like “becoming is better than being” the right mindset according to mindset is a “growth mindset” and in february dorsey finally delivered his “twitter is live” mission statement “hearing about and watching a live event unfold is the fastest way to understand the power of twitter” he wrote in a letter to investors and okay sure people tweet more when there is breaking news or when they’re watching a live event like the super bowl periscope the fastgrowing video app twitter acquired last year is primarily live having reorganized and declared a mindset a vision and a set of priorities dorsey is now in recruiting mode hiring coups so far include former google chief business officer omid kordestani as executive chairman former american express chief marketing officer leslie berland to run marketing and former apple pr executive natalie kerris to head communications there’s also the effusive rehire verrilli who says “if you are here you’re here because you believe in this place and you’re trying to create something great” indeed staring at one of the many neonblue signs at twitter’s offices that command you to lovewhereyouwork when you actually hateit would be miserable disgruntled employees have no shortage of wellfunded startups to jump to and scores have done just that landing predominately at uber lyft and slack some twitter employees are calling slack a business messaging software startup “the new old twitter” there’s even a slack chatroom where hundreds of twitter alumni at different companies share articles and gossip about their former employer—it’s called flown the coop those who stayed got a giant thankyou gift from dorsey in october when he announced plans to give a third of his twitter stock worth  million at

above tony effik vice president of media and connections at ad agency rga says buying ads on twitter works great for reaching prominent professionals and leaders who drive public debates the scale may not be there he says but the influence is twitter isn’t profitable but it has a  billion pile of cash and though an unusually high percentage of its shares are held by shortsellers many analysts believe that the company has hit the bottom—it can only go up from here just two out of  analysts covering twitter have a sell rating on the stock “now it’s all about execution” says bob peck an analyst with suntrust robinson humphrey “it’s more of a ‘show me’ story now” in its decade of existence twitter has survived enough drama and dysfunction to kill  startups of its size—it has taken every punch possible as sacca says and is still standing if dorsey can transform “crafty hacky” twitter into a focused productexecution machine the missteps of the past few years should give way to stability and growth twitter has a solid brand a solid business and an influence that’s impossible to quantify that may have to be enough for now—superpower status is out of reach a version of this

love quotes positive quotes funny quotes smile quotes more find on amazon jack dorsey cite this page about about us privacy terms jack dorsey quotes american  businessman born november     loading my goal is to simplify complexity i just want to build stuff that really simplifies our base human interaction jack dorsey goal want build the idea of twitter started with me working in dispatch since i was  years old where taxi cabs or firetrucks would broadcast where they were and what they were doing jack dorsey working me doing the web provides a very easy way to immediately grasp whats going on it really offers the transparency so you can see especially with the search engine how people are using twitter at one glance the phone doesnt allow for that jack dorsey people you see im less interested in how people are following each other and more interested in how they are following topics and tweets themselves people are following more key words and concepts and more ideas and acting on those rather than individuals or organizations jack dorsey words acting ideas i think twitter is the future of communications and square will be the payment network jack dorsey future think will when people come to twitter and they want to express something in the world the technology fades away its them writing a simple message and them knowing that people are going to see it jack dorsey technology writing simple i love cities and i love city governments in particular but in politics it would have taken me  years from implementing a policy before i would get to see the feedback with programming i could model the same policies and see the impact immediately technology is a far more efficient way to test jack dorsey love technology politics whats interesting about twitter and the influencers that someone follows  like say shaquille oneal  is that they see someone who is using the exact same tools that they have access to and i think that inspires this hope to be able to really engage with someone like him jack dorsey hope tools think im is interesting because you look at your buddy list and at a glance see what your friends are listening to what theyre working on what theyre doing the problem was that you were bound to the computer keyboard jack dorsey friends listening problem its a matter of invitations versus context twitter is really good at providing context like im having coffee at third rail coffee foursquare is about invitations to places in this respect foursquare has started to replace yelp for me jack dorsey respect good coffee i fell in love with flora of all types especially ferns loved the sparse structure and repetition of shape  almost fractal jack dorsey love loved repetition anything youre interested in the world  whether it be charlie rose or jetblue or a public figure or your local coffee shop  theyre on twitter and broadcasting what is interesting to them jack dorsey coffee rose world the interesting products out on the internet today are not building new technologies theyre combining technologies instagram for instance photos plus geolocation plus filters foursquare restaurant reviews plus checkins plus geo jack dorsey today building restaurant i think twitter is best when it sparks conversations elsewhere to use youtube and facebook and all the tools we have available to us today to respond and also promote and answer and engage is awesome jack dorsey best today tools theres an entire universe in every single tweet and it all really depends on the content as far as how its going to spread jack dorsey universe single content i loved couriers you had this transfer of physical information happening throughout the city and the world someone picking up the package putting it in a bag going somewhere taking it out of the bag giving it to someone else i thought that was so cool i wanted to map it to see that flow on a big screen jack dorsey cool world city i said a long time ago that foursquare can make cities better you have these augmented realities like foursquare and twitter and facebook that provide these virtual nodes and instant feedback from anywhere adding annotation around a physical places jack dorsey time feedback long i was fascinated with jeans because you can impress your life upon the jeans you wear the way you sit imprints on the jeans jack dorsey life you way twitter was around communication and visualizing what was happening in the world in realtime square was allowing everyone to accept the form of payment people have in their pocket today which is a credit card jack dorsey communication today world a number of people in the united states almost everyone is using plastic cards to pay for things but its extremely difficult to accept these cards so lets make its easy and take more and more of the friction out as we can jack dorsey people cards accept people who are using it to sell things on craigslist to holding garage sales  campaigns  the obama campaign and the romney campaign both used square to raise funds jack dorsey sales people raise what i love about new york is just the electricity i feel right away jack dorsey love new york electricity twitter has been my lifes work in many senses it started with a fascination with cities and how they work and whats going on in them right now jack dorsey life work now the first complaint we hear from everyone is why would i want to join this stupid useless thing and know what my brothers eating for lunch but that really misses the point because twitter is fundamentally recipientcontrolled  you choose to listen and you choose to leave but you also choose what to put down and what to share jack dorsey brother stupid lunch tweetdeck is a very interesting client because it presents a view that no other client in the world presents which is this multicolumn massive amounts of information in one pane and people really really enjoy that jack dorsey world enjoy information you can follow your favorite company or organization you can also mix that in with your family and your social network and talk about all these interests in real time thats the value not the brand twitter twitter just provides the venue for it jack dorsey family time organization share this page cite this page citation find on amazon jack dorsey related authors steve jobs warren buffett henry ford bill gates
