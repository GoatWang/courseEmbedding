directly relevant to the admissibility of economic expert testimony primarily in personal injury wrongful death and wrongful termination cases decisions that establish general standard for admission of expert witness testimny are also included however decisions regarding the admissibility of hedonic damages testimony are not included those decisions can be found at hedonic damages decisions  the descriptions in this list are also provided in the more general list of legal cases of interest to forensic economists available by clicking on useful decisions   the same organizational structure is used for this page that is used in the more general list decisions in federal court are listed under the united states supreme court  st circuit  court of appeals district court decisons in the st curcuit nd circuit  district courts in the nd circuit and so forth and then by states in alphabetic order if  there are no decisions in one of the venues that venue will not be listed united states supreme court daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc  us   sct   led daubert i this decision states that the frye test from fry v united states  f  dc cir  had been superceded by rule  of the federal rules of evidence fre that were adopted by congress in  it directed that trial court judges should act as “gatekeepers” to insure that evidence presented in court was scientifically reliable subject to four general tests  whether the theory or technique underlying the testimony can be or has been tested  whether the theory or technique has been subject to peer review  the known or potential rate of error should be determined as should the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique’s operation  whether the theory or technique has been generally accepted by the relevant scientific community  general electric co v joiner  us   sct   deals with admissibility of expert testimonydeals with admissibility of expert  testimony joiner is the second in the triumvirate of decisions of the united states supreme court elaborating the meaning of the daubert decision the th circuit had reversed the decision of a trial court judge not to allow testimony of a medical expert suggesting that the standards for excluding testimony were more stringent than the tests for admitting testimony the supreme court made it clear that trial court judges have considerable discretion and reversed the th circuit decision justice bryer’s concurring opinion strongly encourages trial court judges to make use of federal rule  which allows court appointed experts kumho tire co ltd v carmichael  us   sct   this decision made it clear that while none of the original four daubert tests may apply in a given instance the general test of scientific reliability applies to all types of expert testimony  weisgram v marley  us   sct   led d   held that if expert testimony that was the basis for a claim was held inadmissible the cause of action could be dismissed without a right of appeal  winans v the new york and erie railroad company  us   l ed   us lexis   “experience has shown that opposite opinions of persons professing to be experts may be obtained to any amount and it often occurs that not only many days but even weeks are consumed in crossexaminations to test the skill or knowledge of such witnesses and the correctness of their opinions wasting the time and wearying the patience of both court and jury and perplexing instead of elucidating the questions involved in the issue” st circuit     court of appeals coastal fuels of puerto rico inc v caribbean petroleum corp  fd  st cir  ruled specifically that daubert and kumho applied to economic analysis stating the district courts gatekeeping function extendes to all expert evidence including economic analysis not merely to evidence involving scientific conclusions cummings v the standard register company  f d  st cir  this decision responds in part to an error in testimony initially made by economic expert martin duffy  after being cross examined duffy realized that he had made an error in calculating front pay at  after correcting his figures duffy then testified to front pay losses of  his figures for back pay were deemed correct duffy’s report was not entered into evidence and the jury awarded   for front pay the st circuit determined that the jury had probably been confused by the initial error in duffy’s calculation and offered cummings the option of accepting  or a new trial the court also determined under a daubert standard that the district court had been correct in determining that duffy’s testimony was admissible and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike the testimony of duffy quinonespancheo v american airlines inc  fd st cir   economic expert mario puchi based his projections on the assumption that the injured plaintiff had intended to reenlist in the military and remain there until eligible to retire on a military pension the economic expert also assumed that the plaitiff had a total and permanent disability which was not borne out by the facts of the case the economic expert was not permitted to testify stevens v bangor and aroostook rr  fd  st cir  the plaintiffs vocational expert was permitted to testify  torrezocasio v texaco puerto rico inc  us dist lexis  d puerto rico  this is was a decision by judge juan m perezgimenez to grant a motion in limine to bar the testimony of plaintiff’s life care planner gerri pennachio and economist francisco e martinez based on the fact that the plaintiff had admitted that the testimony of plaintiff’s expert witness dr jaime zorba did not meet daubert standards since the proposed testimony of the economist depended on the testimony of the life care planner and the testimony of the life care planner depended on the testimony of dr zorba the failure of his testimony to meet daubert standard rendered the testimonies of life care planner and economist inadmissible     district courts in the st circuit ma me nh ri and puerto rico griffith v eastern maine medical center  us dist lexis  d me  the court granted a defense motion to exclude the economic testimony of dr ray neveu based on his failure to issue a complete report of his opinions by the scheduling deadline dr neveu’s report indicated that he would provide details of his opinions in a “timely fashion” which the judge did not regard as meeting the requirements of the court the court said “this court has already specified what a timely fashion is in this case in its scheduling order that is not a matter to be determined at the convenience of the expert witness particularly when no reason is given why the expert cannot comply with the deadline set in the courts scheduling order an experts complete report is due at a specific time during the discovery period in order to allow opposing counsel to depose the expert if desired and to allow the

that berliner is not qualified to render an opinion as to the relevant geographic market by arguing that they do not ‘rely on mr berliner’s expertise for complicated issues such as defining relevant

arguments therefore go to the weight that should be accorded loudat’s testimony rather than its admissibility defendants’ arguments are analogous to a challenge to an expert’s assumption that a

verzilli was that the medical expert had never clearly stated that life care would be needed throughout the plaintiff’s lifetime  the court indicated that the record did indicate that medical expert had expressed that opinion the second challenge was based on the fact that verzilli had been unaware of the plaintiff’s income from a “side job” the court indicated that the defendant had never produced any reliable figure to quantify turner’s additional income at the side job and said “to be sure verzilli’s failure to include an estimate of income from his ‘side job’ casts some doubt about the accuracy of his assumptions underlying his opinion about future lost income that failure does not require a wholesale exclusion of his opinion about future lost income however porter’s contention that verzilli’s opinion should be barred in toto clearly is a misplaced attack on the verifiability of verzilli’s methodology based on daubert porter challenges only verzilli’s underlying assumptions not the methodology that is based on the assumptions moreover by vigorous cross examination porter’s counsel could highlight the inaccuracy or unreliability of verzilli’s estimates based on his failure to consider the “side job” income porter’s counsel could and did attack the validity of the assumptions about turner’s capacity to work that verzilli relied upon when formulating his ultimate opinion we note that the jury must have understood the significance of the assumptions’ questionable validity because the jury discounted a portion of verzilli’s projections and awarded less than

follows “dr paranjpe    purported to measure the loss in parental training and guidance to hailey   he calculated the loss as the difference between obtaining a high school degree and a college degree he based this measurement on the premise that children who lose a parent suffer from the loss of parental guidance and support conducive to achieving higher education in other words hailey is at risk for not going to college because she has lost her father and his presumably positive influence accordingly she is entitled to the amount of money she may lose out on because of that risk dr paranjpe calculated hailey’s projected compensation to age  based on her attaining a college degree at  and her projected compensation based on her obtaining a high school degree at    he explained that ‘the loss of her father has put her at risk as measured by the difference between the college degree and high school compensation of the magnitude of  over four years or an average of  per year” after extended analysis of the literature judge torres said “we find that plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the reliability prong of daubert with regard to their expert’s opinion that the proper measure of the loss of parental guidance and support to a child whose father is deceased is the difference between her projected college degree compensation and her projected high school compensation common sense tells us that the loss of a parent may have an impact on a child in many ways or as dr paranjpe testified ‘the loss of a parent in the household puts a child at risk’   but the rest of dr

discipline that they’re particularly trained at intellectually and have experience at by writing or studying or doing research or running surveys or something  and i think you can be qualified as an expert if you can demonstrate on the record that you have an ability based on your experience and your training your education to given an opinion that recognizes all sides of the issue and because of what you know and study and thought and believe that you’re on the correct side of the issue” iowa sallis v lemansky  nwd  iowa  this decision responds in part to an appeal by a defendant that resulted in the reversal of the decision of a trial court and the granting of a new trial as part of the decision the iowa supreme court considered at some length the question of whether testimony from the plaintiff’s unnamed economist should have been admitted the court pointed out that the economist had not considered time off for illness or vacation “beyond what was reflected in  earnings” and had not worked as an overtheroad truck driver for approximately two years before the injury to the plaintiff the court pointed out that the standard in iowa is earning capacity so that if the plaintiff had taken a lower paying job to be close to his children he could still have recovered for his earning capacity in trucking the court pointed out however that “defendants had the opportunity to present evidence concerning the trucking industry plaintiff’s driving record and plaintiff’s work history to discredit the economist’s opinion plaintiff is correct that these factors go to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility” on this aspect of the appeal the iowa supreme court held that the trial court judge had not abused his discretion by admitting the testimony of the economist kansas armstrong v city of wichita  kan app d   pd  kan app   this decision holds that neither the frye or daubert standards apply to decisions of an administrative law judge or the workers compensation board admission of testimony from a treating physician nor must “occupational disease” be precisely defined  the armstrong court quoted chinn v gay  taylor inc  kan  syl p   pd  as follows “the existence nature and extent of the disability of an injured workman is a question of fact medical testimony is not essential to the establishment of these facts and it is not necessary that a workman’s disability be given a medical name or label” emphasis added in the armstrong decision  kuhn v sandoz pharmaceuticals corporation  kan   pd  kan   this was the most recent affirmation that kansas retains the frye test instead of recognizing daubert it also emphasizes that the frye test does not apply to “pure opinion” expert testimony citing florida power and light co v tursi  so d  fla dist app  as a reference to the “pure opinion” exception to the frye test it also cited logerquist v mcvey  ariz  arizona  in its extensive discussion of the “pure opinion” exception to the frye test in this case the issues had to do with the admissibility of medical testimony which the kuhn court felt did not employ “a new or experimental scientific technique” in a way that would trigger the frye test of general acceptance  state v warden  pd  kan  retained frye standard rejecting daubert as more liberal than frye louisiana anderson v sharp  us dist lexis  ed la  melville wolfson was permitted to testify about “sums for lost income fringe benefits loss of support loss of household services and medical expenses in this case even though the claim was a “lost chance of survival” claim interpreted under louisiana law the defense maintained that mrs anderson was not entitled to bring a wrongful death action because mr anderson did not have a greater than fifty percent chance of survival absent any alleged negligence of the defendants” the district court relied the louisiana supreme court in smith v state  sod   as providing the framework for “lost chance of survival” cases in louisiana and admitted wolfson’s testimony bell v penney  us dist lexis wd la   this decision denied an appeal by the defendant based on the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge previously filed as bell v penney  us dist lexis  wd la   in that report the magistrate judge said “defendants argue that plaintiff’s expert economist dr christensen should be excluded because his oneparagraph report is based on plaintiff’s own testimony of her lost wages rather than ‘actual wage records’ because his testimony is not based on the opinions of any vocational rehabilitation expert and because there is no medical evidence as to plaintiff’s limitations”    plaintiff’s testimony is a sufficient factual basis for the expert’s opinions to be admitted the trier of fact however is entitled to accept or reject the plaintiff’s self serving testimony and in turn any expert economic testimony based on it as plaintiffs point out it is ‘the r ole of the adversarial system not the court to highlight weak evidence’    nor is there a requirement that vocational rehabilitation testimony be presented in every case it is entirely proper for the expert to base his report on the assumption that the plaintiff has medical thus work limitations  – otherwise his testimony would be immaterial however if at trial there is no testimony supporting that assumption then the district judge can consider excluding dr christensen’s testimony at that time” broussard v  lafayette insurance company  la app lexis  la app  this was an appeal based on trial court admission of testimony by vocational expert glen hebert and economist dr douglas womack the appeals court affirmed the trial court ruling that these witnesses could testify quoting its own decision in rowe v state farm mutual automobile insurance company  sod  la app  as follows “as a general rule the factual basis of an expert’s opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony not to its admissibility and it is up to the opposing party to examine the factual basis of the opinion in cross examination loudermill v dow chemical co  fd  th cir  however if an expert opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury then the testimony should not be admitted at all” brown v  city of madisonville   laapp  cir   so d  la app  this decision rejected an appeal based on a defense appeal that the trial court had erred in denying its motion in limine to exclude the testimony of dr charles bettinger an economist based on a daubert objection the court implicitly held that economic testimony is “nonscientific expert testimony” and quoted kumho tire company ltd v carmichael  us   sct in holding that “the law grants a district judge the same broad latitude when it decides how to determine reliability as it enjoys in respect to its ultimate reliability determination” the court went on to say “accordingly the factual basis for an expert opinion determines the credibility of the testimony it is the responsibility of opposing counsel to explore the factual basis pg  for the opinion and thus determine its reliability an unsupported opinion can offer no assistance to the fact finder and should not be admitted as expert testimony   the trial court’s opinion must be tied to the facts of the particular case the abuse of discretion standard applies to the ultimate conclusion as to whether to exclude expert witness testimony and to the trial court’s decision as to how to determine reliability  furthermore when opinions of expert witnesses differ it is for the trial of fact to determine the most credible evidence and these determinations will not be overturned unless it is proven that the expert’s stated reasons are patently unsound” at issue was dr bettinger’s decision to base the lost earnings of the plaintiff on his past wages as a truck driver working for an employer and to ignore the truck driver’s earnings while working as an independent contractor the plaintiff had not done well as an independent contractor and had returned to working for an employer the court quoted portions of dr bettinger’s testimony which clearly explained why he had ignored plaintiff’s earnings as an independent contractor and said “the reasons expressed by dr bettinger are logical reasonable and supported by the evidence thus we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing dr bettinger to testify regarding his calculations of mr brown’s lost wages past and future”  suggested by robert taylor d’ambrosia v lang  la app lexis  la app  thomas meunier a vocational expert was permitted to testify based on “worklife expectancy tables for people with severe disabilities and nonsevere disabilities compared to people of the same age and level of education” but did not permit meunier to reduce future values to present value meunier was also not permitted to testify about national average wages of orthopedic surgeons meunier’s credentials were described as follows “he has been a licensed rehabilitation counselor for almost  years he completed graduate course work in psychology but did not complete his master’s degree in psychology    mr meunier admitted that he is not an economist and does not have a degree in business accounting finance or economics instead he works in conjunction with economists in this regard he identifies the types of work that people could do after an injury and then provides the economist with their earning capacity the economist then takes that figure and discounts it to work up an analysis” maine donatelli v unumprovident corporation  us dist lexis  d maine  this decision is a judicial memorandum granting in part and rejecting in part the testimony about lost earnings by plaintiff’s expert mary h fox phd in a wrongful termination matter dr fox is not an expert in accounting or economics but has a doctorate in applied adult developmentassessment and has worked in the field of industrial psychology for approximately  years the court allowed dr fox’s testimony about future employability as a result of plaintiff’s termination but excluded her damages calculation the judge provides extended discussion of the reasoning behind his decision that dr fox’s damages calculation did not meet the requirements of rule    maryland reed v state of maryland  md   ad  md  in maryland a hearing on a motion in limine to preclude false or inaccurate testimony is called a “fryereed” hearing “frye” refers to frye v united states  dc cir   f   this is the “reed” part of the maryland standard and spells out how the frye ruling applies in maryland frye has been referred to as the “general acceptance” standard that for a scientific premise to be accepted in court it must be “generally accepted” in the scientific field from which the testimony is derived in frye the relevant field was persons with expert knowledge about the accuracy of lie detector examinations in reed the relevant field was determined to be persons with expert knowledge about voice detection form telephone calls relative to voice samples taken from an accused plaintiff the decision contains extensive discussion of science and applications of the frye test in other states it is well worth reading by economic experts particularly those contemplating testimony in maryland courts  the dissent in this decision is also extended and thoughtful the court said “the introduction of evidence based on a scientific process not generally accepted in the scientific community is likely to distract the fact finder from its central concern namely the rendition of a judgment on the merits of the litigation without the frye test or something similar the reliability of an experimental scientific technique is likely to become a central issue in each trial in which it is introduced as long as there remains serious disagreement in the scientific community over its reliability again and again crossexamination of expert witnesses will be as protracted and timeconsuming as it was at the trial in the instant case and proceedings may well degenerate into trials of the technique itself the frye test is designed to forestall this difficulty as well the court also said “our adoption of the frye standard does not of course disturb the traditional discretion of the trial judge with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony frye sets forth only a legal standard which governs the trial judge’s determination of a threshold issue  testimony based on a technique which is found to have gained ‘general acceptance in the scientific community’ may be admitted into evidence but only if a trial court judge also determines in the exercise of his discretion as he must in all other instances of expert testimony that the proposed testimony will be helpful to the jury that the expert is properly qualified etc obviously however if a technique does not meet the frye standard a trial judge will have no occasion to reach these further issues  michigan craig v oakwood hospital  mich lexis  mich  the michigan supreme court held that davisfrye standard continues to be the standard for admissibility of expert testimony in michigan it reversed a decision of the trial court judge not to hold a davisfrye hearing to determine whether the testimony of medical doctor’s

the persons most qualified to assess scientific validity have the determinative voice”  prectel v gonse  nwd  minnesota  the minnesota supreme court affirmed the trial court’s decision to allow the

approximately  years of age provides approximately  worth of services to the family per year he based his opinion on a study by gaugher and walker entitled “the dollar value of household work” zumberge v northern states power co  nwd  minn app  the minnesota court of appeals upheld the admission of testimony by dr michael behr “the trial court found that dr behr was a qualified economist

damages in a personal injury action are not compensable unless reasonably certain to occur   damages based on mere mathematical probabilities significantly undercompensate those who actually develop cancer and are a windfall to those who do not no acceptable definition of justice would contemplate such a result consequently this claim of injury is fatally defective”   callahan v cardinal glennon hospital  swd missouri   this decision indicates the status of missouri on the issues of the frye test versus daubert standards for admitting expert testimony the supreme court indicates that there was no objection to the testimony of the plaintiff’s experts so the court did not decide “whether section  rsmo supp  supercedes the frye doctrine in the same manner that daubert held that federal rule  changes the requirements for the admissibility of expert testimony in federal court” there has been no subsequent decision on this matter  first nat’l bank of fort smith v kansas city southern

for swearingen’s assumption that the needs motivating the life care plan would exist in the future the court said “it is not enough for the doctor to testify to the possibility of a certain result his testimony should show that it is reasonably certain to follow the injury consequences which are contingent speculative or merely possible are not proper to be considered by the jury in ascertaining the damages for it would be plainly unjust to compel one to pay damages for results that may or may not ensue and which are merely problematical” greer v continental gaming company  swd  moapp  the western district court of appeals held that john o ward’s testimony about lost earnings and lost household services should not have been admitted because “ward’s testimony was based on the assumption that greer age  at the time of trial would not be able to work for the next five or ten years and would be unable to perform household servies for the rest of her life an expert may base an opinion on hypothesized facts but when such opinion other than one stated on cross examination is based on hypothesized information the facts must either be in the record or admissible as evidence citing lytle v

the necessary factual or evidentiary support did not exist “for dr  ward’s assumption that mr hobbs’ vestibular or other injuries would affect his earning capacity got twenty years into the future in the same way they had in the past” the court did not criticize dr ward but pointed to the lack of foundation or the assumption he had been asked to make by the plaintiff attorney the court quoted

“clearly under this standard dr vogenthaler was a qualified expert as to kauzlararich’s employability following the accident as well as his future loss of earnings dr vogenthaler had more education

admission of expert testimony in missouri is missouri’s section  which is similar to but not identical to federal rule  it is not frye as had been previously interpreted and not daubert but section  the court argued while missouri’s section  is nearly identical to federal rule  it contains small wording differences that make it a more stringent standard than federal rule  section  goes beyond rule  “to require that the facts or data on which an expert bases an opinion or inference ‘must be of a type reasonably relied upon by expert in the field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject’ and that these facts and data ‘must be otherwise reasonably reliable’” thus a court must independently assess the reliability of facts or data of critical importance this also requires that a court identify the relevant scientific community in which the data and facts are accepted the mcdonagh court pointed out that daubert does not require identification of the relevant scientific community at issue in the case was the relevant community within which dr mcdonagh practiced holding that it was the community of doctors treating vascular disease not all doctors and not doctors using chelation therapy as the state board of registration and dr mcdonagh had respectively argued  theines v harlin fruit co  sw d  mo app  the plaintiff had based his projection of damages on a

expert the court said “mr weitlauf lacks the education andor economics background to be qualified as an expert economist regarding the plaintiff’s alleged economic damages he is employed as a bank official with a bachelor’s degree in finance he has never before  prepared an economic loss valuation for any individual  never taught a class on evaluating the types of economic losses alleged in this lawsuit and  has never been hired as an economic loss expert he has no formal training in the field of economic losses as alleged in this lawsuit no experience or practical knowledge that would provide him with some level of expertise in such a field thus he fails to meet the criteria of rule  andor daubert it appears to this court that his “expertise” was developed solely for purposes of his mother’s lawsuit furthermore mr weitlauf’s analysis was done solely on the basis of information supplied to him by the plaintiff he failed to consult or obtain any objective information regarding his mother’s employment status such as her salary and value of her fringe benefits his “valuations” were primarily calculated using the missouri public school retirement system’s website without any real understanding as to the mechanics of the website’s protocol for calculating retirement benefits finally as her son mr weitlauf is listed as a primary beneficiary on plaintiff’s retirement account and a named beneficiary in her will thus his expert testimony is not objective since he has a financial stake in her recovery of economic damages in this lawsuit” williams v daus md  mo app lexis  mo

issues of this case because they did not identify any specific causative agent for the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy”  the court went on to say “under the daubertschafersman analysis expert testimony lacks ‘fit’ when ‘a large analytic leap must be made between the facts and the opinion’” that is the case here assuming without deciding that the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy was the

the defendant’s expert’s testimony was limited to criticism of the methods used by the plaintiff’s expert and did not include his own opinion about the cause of the fire this issue was rendered moot

as used in the new worklife expectancy tables and marchisio’s vague conclusion that phillips would work ‘less’ as a result of her disability the testimony ‘was so generic and lacking in certainty that it failed to make the existence of a disputed fact more or less probable and was of no value to the jury”  the nebraska supreme court went on to say “the court noted that the definition of ‘disabled’ as used in the new worklife expectancy tables made no differentiation between people with minor disabilities and those withe serious disabilities or between people with disabilities that affect their

as a biomechanical expert and stated standards for admission of expert testimony in nevada under nevada’s nrs  which the court said closely tracked rule  of the federal rules of evidence the court said “in determining whether an expert’s opinion is based upon reliable methodology a district court should consider whether the opinion is  within a recognized field of expertise  testable and has been tested  published and subjected to peer review  generally accepted in the scientific community not always determinative and  based more on particularized facts rather than assumption conjecture or generalization if the expert formed his or her opinion based upon the results of a technique experiment or calculation then a district court should also consider whether  the technique experiment or calculation was controlled by known standards  the testing conditions were similar to the conditions at the time of the incident  the technique experiment or calculation had a known error rate and  it was developed by the proffered expert for purposes of the present dispute we again note that these factors are not exhaustive may be accorded varying weights and may not apply equally in every case” the nevada supreme court also noted “to date    this court has not adopted the united states supreme court of fre  in daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc but as we have stated daubert and the federal court decisions discussing it may provide persuasive authority in determining whether expert testimony should be admitted in nevada courts”  suggested by terry dineen and thomas cargill

of his file during lunch after lunch he acknowledged that he could not state with certainty who directed him to contact alvarez regarding details of plaintiff’s teamster’s pension interest the superior court said “dr rosenberg could not provide foundational support for the use of hearsay evidence attributed to alvarez precluding the substantiation and thus the admissibility of his testimony

job however the trial court also noted that the plaintiff went back to work at his old job after recovering from his injury that the plaintiff was a valued employee who was getting raises and “good personnel notes in his file” thus the reason for granting defense motions to bar wolf’s testimony was that he had not developed any statistical basis for assessing the probability that the plaintiff would lose his job in the future both the trial court and the superior court however made it clear that a worker can have a loss of earning capacity even if the worker is making a higher income now than before the worker’s injury doing so however must be based on some “evidentiary and logical basis or at least rationally estimating a compensatory award” suggested by frank tinari kemp v state of new jersey  nj lexis  nj  the new jersey supreme court ruled that an medical doctor expert witness should not have been excluded from testifying without a rule  hearing  in the process it widened its acceptance of daubert v merrell dow  us   from toxic torts to medical testimony rejecting the “general acceptance” standard it had maintained earlier the frye decision is not specifically mentioned and the court ruled directly from new jersey rule   the court effectively said that a party was entitled to present its expert at a separate hearing to determine the expert’s admissibility before being excluded  state v doriguzzi  ad  althought new jersey is an avowed frye state this decision uses a daubert style for toxic tort litigation state v harvey  ad  although new jersey is an avowed frye state this decision uses a daubert style for toxic tort litigation new york hernandez v  company  ny slip op u ny misc  in rejecting an appeal by defendants the court said “the court notes that defendants failed to call their own economist to possibly challenge plaintiff’s economist’s calculations his testimony along with the record of plaintiff’s record of earnings and plaintiff’s medical testimony were sufficient to justify the jury’s determination of earnings and to survive defendant’s challenge” the court went on to say “the award for economic loss is sustained with one exception as stated above plaintiff produced the plaintiff’s w statements and fica earnings statements from which his expert economist arrived at his projections for the cost of replacement of the plaintiff’s insurance policy the economic report multiplied the plaintiff’s earnings by  without any evidence of the contents of the insurance policy or the amount of premium the plaintiff paid the evidence therefore was insufficient to make such a determination accordingly the damages must be reduced by the product of that  calculation”  smith v mv woods construction company  ny app div lexis  ny app   the court held that “plaintiff’s vocational rehabilitation expert was not qualified to express an opinion on past and future loss of earnings past and future loss of household services and past and future medical services” the court cited several decisions in which an expert was qualified for one type of testimony but not another and drew the analogy that “a medical doctor is not qualified as a ballistics expert” citing a case in which that ruling had been made  walek v walek  misc d   nysd   dr frederick floss the economic expert for the plaintiff was opposed by a defense expert unnamed in the specific area of the health care benefits of the new york state retirement system the decision includes an extensive statement of the background expertise of dr floss to address this question saying “thus while defendant’s expert is certainly qualified in her area her lack of familiarity with an employee’s health care benefits significantly dilutes the weight of her testimony on the other hand the referee found the evidence given by plaintiff’s expert entirely credible and fully persuasive on all pertinent points and i agree with that determination”  weeden v first national bank of long island  add   nysd  nyapp  the appeals court held that the trial court had properly exercised its discretion in prelcuding the plaintiff’s expert economist from testifying based on plaintiff’s failure to comply with cplr  d i the plaintiff had failed to reserve his right to pursue claims for the cost of future medical expenses about which the economist was precluded from testifying north carolina howerton v arai helmet ltd  nc lexis  nc  this decision held that north carolina has not implicitly adopted the standards of daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals  us   s ct   the north carolina supreme court held that north carolina had been relying on rule  rather than the frye general acceptance standard long before the daubert decision but after reviewing north carolina case law regarding admission of expert testimony said “while these and other north carolina cases share obvious similarities with the principles underlying daubert application of the north carolina approach is decidedly less mechanistic and rigorous than the “exacting standards of reliability” demanded by the federal approach” suggested by joe agrusa ohio eastman v  the stanley works  ohio  ohio app  the ohio court of appeals reversed the trial court decision and remanded the case for retrial on the basis of the testimony of vocational expert dr  bruce growick and economist dr richard palfin the court concluded that the jury’s award of future economic damages was not supported by the evidence presented by growick and palfin growick’s testimony was that the physical difficulties and eye impairment of the plaintiff resulting from his injury reduced the number of jobs for which the plaintiff was qualified before his injury by  to  percent growick acknowledged that plaintiff  was earning as much after the injury as before the injury and “admitted that it would be speculative to state that appellee would be unable to perform his job at a particular point in the future” with respect to palfin the court said “on cross examination dr palfin conceded that he had based his annual earnings calculation on a week year he also testified that he had not taken into account the seasonal nature of appellee’s work and the fact that appellee’s work weeks were not uniformly hour weeks therefore dr palfin had used an annual future wage   of  while appellee’s annual salary prior to the accident was only  dr palfin did not assign a starting year for when appellee would experience loss of earning capacity rather he stated it would be up to the jury to determine when appellee would actually begin to experience any loss of earning capacity” nilavar v osborn  ohio app d   ned  ohio app  the issue being decided was whether the trial court erred in allowing the economic damages testimony of alan duvall who based his calculations on the gamboa “worklife expectancy tables” the court ruled that the gamboa study may not qualify as “scientific information but it does fall   under the category of either “technical” or “other specialized information” no challenge was made of duvall’s qualifications the court set a standard that “a theory is considered ‘widely accepted’ if it is propounded by at least a substantial minority of experts in the relevant field” it then ruled that the gamboa study met that standard because “the gamboa study was based on data from the current population survey by the us department of commerce bureau of the census the gamboa study had been published for least nine years at the time of trial and duvall knew of other experts who relied on it duvall also testified that if he had based his damage calculations on the ‘cieka sic study” which osborn’s expert recognized as authoritative his calculations would have been even higher duvall utilized the more conservative study pirolozzi v stanbro  us dist lexis  ndohio  this is a judicial order denying among other issues defendant’s motions to bar the testimony of vocational expert dr robert ancell and economic expert dr michael thomson the court said “the defendants rely on the ohio wrongful death statute orc § b and ohio caselaw interpreting the statute to require that any calculation of lost earnings must be reduced for personal consumption costs   with respect to dr ancell the defendants claim that his report merely summarizes general data without any application as to the specific facts and circumstances of the pirolozzi situation   as to dr thompson’s report the defendants find it unreliable because it depends on baseless assumptions and does not factor in the decedent’s disability at the time of death his risky behaviors or an offset for personal consumption among other factors    further the defendants challenge thompson’s testimony that considers the decedent’s children’s potential future earnings loss arguing that it does not rely upon a cognizable economic theory of recovery  with regard to the children and their potential earnings if they do not attend college the plaintiff explains that the argument is not that the children will not be able to afford college without the financial contribution of their father but that they will be less likely to attend without the emotional support of the father   noting that both parties will have expert testimony on these issues and that both parties can cross examine the other’s experts the court finds the testimony of dr ancell and dr thomson to be admissible with respect to the specific issue of the ohio wrongful death statutue and the need to deduct personal consumption from lost earning capacity the court concludes that these issues go to the weight of ancell’s and thomson’s testimony not the admissibility of their testimony  the court next considers the issue of whether the decedent’s children can recover a loss of their own earnings on the theory that the loss of consortium of their father in terms of emotional support will make them less likely to attend college without the experts present at the daubert hearing to testify as to the reliability of this theory and whether there exists peerreviewed literature on the topic the court defers a ruling until trial the economic experts are permitted to testify generally but the court will separately voir dire before the experts testify on this particular theory” suggested by robert taylor oregon jennings v baxter healthcare corporation  pd   or  or  this decision sets out the standards to be used in determining the admissibility of expert testimony in oregon which recognizes the frye test but relies on rule  in a manner similar to daubert the trial court had excluded the testimony of a physician about plaintiff’s silicone breast implants causing her neurological difficulties the oregon court of appeals had reversed the trial court decision on this basis the oregon supreme court reversed the court of appeals decision and affirmed the trial court decision  in doing so it relied on its own decision in state v brown  o   pd   to set out a list of seven factors to determine admissibility “ the technique’s general acceptance in the field  the expert’s qualifications and stature  the use which has been made of the technique  the potential rate of error  the existence of specialized literature  the novelty of the invention and  the extent to which the technique relies on the subjective interpretation of the expert” the jennings court also cited a footnote from state v brown containing  additional factors a court may consider “ the potential rate of error in using the technique  the existence and maintenance of standards governing its use  presence of safeguards in the characteristics of the technique  analogy to other scientific techniques whose results are admissible  the extent to which the technique has been accepted by scientists in the field involved  the nature and breadth of the inference adduced  the clarity and simplicity with which the technique can be described and the results explained  the extent to which the basic data are verifiable by the court and jury  the availability of other experts to test and evaluate the technique  the probative significance of the evidence in the circumstances of the case and  the care with which the technique was employed in the case” submitted by bob male pennsylvania commonwealth v crews  ad  pa  retained frye standard rejecting daubert as more liberal than frye grady v fritolay inc  pa lexis  pa  with this decision the pennsylvania supreme court maintained pennsylvania’s adherence to the frye test based on frye v united states  us app dc   f  dc cir  in doing so it continued to reject he us supreme court decision in daubert v merrell dow phamaceuticals inc  us   the court said “in our view frye’s ‘general acceptance’ test is a proven and workable rule which when faithfully followed fairly serves its purpose of assisting the courts in determining when scientific evidence is reliable and should be admitted” submitted by terry dinneen and joseph agrusa   vinitski v adler  pa d  cth  pa d  c  the trial court had rejected a medical expert’s testimony based on the requirements of the frye test the trial court decision was upheld by the common pleas court the decision contains extensive discussion of the frye test and the frye hearing that was held on this issue the court said “it is important to understand two terms as defined by the superior court the first term methodology is ‘ a method of research in which a problem is identified  relevant data are gathered  a hypothesis is formulated from these data and  the hypothesis is empirically tested’ trach v fellin  ad  pa super  ‘empirical’ is defined as ‘provable or verifiable by experience or experiment’” the court determined that the “methods” of the medical expert “appear to be nothing more than a few anecdotal references and a cursory review of several studies tangentially related to benzodizepines and possible permanent effects”  south dakota degen v bayman  sd   nwd  sdak the trial court decision had been appealed by the plaintiff on several grounds one of those grounds was that the trial court “did not fully instruct the jury instruct the jury on damages for pain suffering and mental anguish as well as for time lost from pursuing normal activities while the specific words ‘personal inconvenience and loss of ability to enjoy life’ were not used their meaning was embodied therein had the court given the refused instruction it would have been only cumulative of those already given and might very well have only confused the jury in its deliberations” garland v rossknecht  sd   nwd  sdak  the economic expert testimony of don frankenfeld was ruled inadmissible because “frankenfeld had concluded that garland had suffered from “a ten percent ‘disability’ or earning capacity reduction when questioned about how he arrived at this percentage frankenfeld stated ‘it was a judgment call’ in fact his opinion was based solely on information provided by garland garland reported that when he worked on a fourhour graphic design project he had to take a half hour break frankenfeld extrapolated a half hour break every four hours into one hour of nonproductivity a day he then took ‘one and divided it by eight one hour out of an eighthour day is oneeighth twelve and a half percent’ he then discounted the rating to ten percent” frankenfeld then admitted that “a vocational expert has competence i do not have to take physical limitations and translate them into vocational limitations” in spite of this the trial court admitted frankenfeld’s testimony the south dakota supreme court reversed on this grounds kay v  lamar advertising of south dakota inc  us dist lexis  d south dakota  this was an order denying defendant’s motion in limine to limit the testimony of dr walter lierman an economist on behalf of the plaintiff judge karen e schreier applied a daubert standard as interpreted by the th circuit in lauzon v senco products  fd  th cir  in holding that the proposed testimony of dr lierman was based on sufficient facts and data was a product of reliable principles and methods and that dr lierman applied the methodology reliably to the facts of the case in her analysis of “sufficient facts and data” judge schreier said “rule  does not require dr lierman to have all of the facts or even the best facts it only requires ‘sufficient facts’ see fed r  evid  any weakness perceived by defendants in the factual basis of dr lierman’s opinions are capable of being brought out in crossexamination and argued to the jury” tennessee mcdaniel v csx transportation inc  swd  tenn  this tennessee decision explains the standards for the admission of scientific testimony in tennessee it can be described as a daubert plus decision the court held that tennessee rules  and  govern the admissibility of scientific evidence and explicitly reject the frye test of general acceptance as the only test for admissibility in tennessee the court points out that the tennessee versions of rules  and  are uniquely different from the corresponding federal rules tenn r evid  requires that scientific evidence “substantially assist the trier of fact” while federal rule  only requires that scientific evidence “assist the trier of fact”  similarly tenn r evid  states that “the court shall disallow testimony in the form of an opinion or inference if the underlying facts or data indicate lack of trustworthiness” the court points out that there is no similar language in fed r evid  the court went on to say that the tests in daubert were useful but that “no framework exists that provides for simple and practical application in every case the complexity and diversity of potential scientific evidence is simply to vast for the application of a single test” the court summarized its conclusions as follows “simply put unless the scientific evidence is valid it will not substantially assist the trier of fact nor will its underlying facts and data appear trustworthy but there is no requirement in the rule that it be generally accepted” texas ei du pont de nemours  co v robinson  swd   tex sup st j    in this case the texas supreme court took a very strong position in favor of scientific considerations for admission of expert testimony paralleling the daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc  us   decision at the federal level the robinson court discussed rule  at length before providing a list of six non inclusive factors that a trial court should consider  the extent to which the theory has been or can be tested  the extent to which the technique relies upon the subjective interpretation of the expert  whether the theory has been subjected to peer review andor publication  the technique’s potential rate of error  whether the underlying theory or technique has been generally accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community and  the nonjudicial uses which have been made of the theory or technique  gammill v jack williams chevrolet inc  swd  tex  this decision could be called the kumho decision of texas although it was reached before the united states supreme court reached its decision in kumho tire co ltd v carmichael  us   sct    it holds that the specific scientific factors mentioned in daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc  us   sct   led  and in ei du pont de nemours  co v robinson  swd   tex sup st j   may not be applicable in all cases but that the gatekeeper role of trial courts under rule  applies in all instances of expert testimony both in terms of the reliability of the expert and his or her testimony the court said “even if the specific factors set out in daubert for assessing the reliability and relevance of scientific evidence do not fit other expert testimony the court is not relieved of its responsibility to evaluate the reliability of the testimony in determining its admissibility” in this decision there is stress on the fact that the fact that an expert would be qualified to testify on some matters does not imply that the expert would be qualified to testify on the matters at hand gmbh v davis  tex app lexis  tex app   a texas court of appeals upheld the admission of dr keith fairchild on behalf of the plaintiff in a case involving a claim of damages based on commercial misrepresentation by gmhb the standard of review under ei du pont de nemours  co v robinson  swd   the daubert of texas is short and clear fairchild has a doctorate in economics and teaches a university course in corporate valuation so he is qualified fairchild’s testimony aided the jury in resolving a factual dispute in the absense of contrary evidence fairchild’s methods had a reliable foundation guzman v guajardo  swd  texapp  dr everett dillman had presented a benchmark for the value of the loss of society of decent’s society to his mother based on one hour per day over the life expectancy of the mother valued at salaries in the helping professions including clergy social work and counselors the texas court of appeals did not reverse on the basis of this admission  dr dillman also provided testimony about lost earnings and lost household services  manasco v insurance company of the state of pennsylvania  tex app lexis  the traumacancer testimony of dr  richard hamer was not admitted dr hamer a boardcertified neurologist testified that the plaintiff’s head injury caused his cancer the texas court of appeals applied the standards of texas rule  based on the standards laid out in ei du pont de nemours  co v robinson  swd   to exclude the testimony the court discussed the literature concerning head injury trauma and cancer and concluded that the trial court had been correct in refusing to admit dr hamer’s testimony  this is of special interest becauase the theory of cancer caused by trauma was the leading example of “junk science” in peter huber’s definition of that term in galileo’s revenge junk science in the courtroom basic books   pilgrim’s pride corporation v smoak  swd  tex app  the defense appealed based on the admission of testimony by two experts including economist dr dale funderbunk on the basis of insufficient evidence of causation past and future lost earning capacity or future medical care to sustain a judgment pilgrim’s pride contended that dale funderbunk was not a qualified vocational expert or employment specialist and that his methodology was flawed the decision describes funderbunk’s assumptions and methodology in some detail including the fact that funderbunk had used several different assumptions about worklife expectancy the court held that funderbunk was properly qualified and that his testimony was not based on an unsound methodology   seariver maritime v pike  tex app lexis  tex app  seariver appealed the trial court decision to allow dr robert voogt to testify relying significantly on the exclusion of dr voogt in the case of norwest bank  v kmart  us dist lexis  nd ind   the court held that “norwest is plainly distinguishable as we read dr voogt’s testimony his approach in this case avoided the mistakes in norwest he based much of his cost evaluation upon the records and recommendations of the treating physicians unlike norwest other qualified health care providers testified and related many of the components of the health care plan further unlike norwest seariver also provided health care evidence through its own life care expert the pharmaceutical prescriptions were based on pike’s past treatment history which voogt delineated taken as a whole dr voogt demonstrated special knowledge concerning most of the very matters on which he gave an opinion    under these circumstances we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to exclude the totality of the expert’s testimony” parts of dr voogt’s testimony were excluded but those parts were not part of the appeal   strauss v continental airlines inc  swd  texas app  this decision involves a claim by a new orleans attorney that his injury while boarding a continental flight cost him a line of business in kosciusko mississippi because of difficulties in travel even though it did not impair his ability to work in new orleans the decision provides extensive discussion of the legal meaning of earning capacity pointing out that there is a right to recover for past loss of earning capacity but that the burden of proof for past lost earnings is greater than that for loss of future earning capacity  the court said “in determining what evidence is sufficient to support a claim of lost earning capacity no general rule can be laid down except that each case must be judged on its peculiar facts and the damages proved with that degree of certainty of which the case is susceptible” the review of prior case in the decision is very interesting the decision then examines the theories of damages advanced by the plaintiff and concluded “strauss’s damages were susceptible to showing a higher degree of certainty  as a result the jury lacked any evidence from which to intelligently determine what the reasonable value of his ability to generate contingency fee cases from kosciusko was prior to this injury or the amount of past impairment”  virginia belshe v pinecrest cluster association  va cir lexis   testimony of plaintiff’s exert orthopedist was excluded because plaintiff failed to meet scheduling deadlines for providing a report the court the testimony of anthony bird a vocational expert because bird was unable to formulate his own opinions in the absence of the orthopedist’s report the court also excluded the testimony of richard edelman an economist to the extent that his opinions would have depended on either the opinions of the orthopedist or mr bird but allowed dr edelman to compute and testify about prejudgment interest to the jury john v im  va   sed  this virgina supreme court decision used daubert standards to uphold the decision of the trial court judge in denying the admissibility of a psychologist and an expert on qeeg testing of electrical functioning of the brain the defense argued that the court properly excluded the testimony because the testimony lacked a sufficient factual basis did not take into account all testing variables and did not assess the effect of those variables on the test results  the virginia supreme court agreed vasquez v mabini  va   sed  va  “at trial the plaintiff presented the testimony of richard b edelman a professor emeritus of finance at american university as an expert witness with regard to the decedent’s loss of income and the economic value of the loss of her services protection care and assistance no objection was made to his qualifications he testified that mrs mabini’s lost income and benefits would have amounted to  if she had worked until age  and  if she had worked until age  he gave the value of her lost services as  and reasonable funeral expenses as  his calculation of the total loss to the beneficiaries was thus  based on retirement at age  and   based on retirement at age  these conclusions were necessarily dependent upon certain assumptions to which the defendants objected that the decedent would have found fulltime employment the day after the accident at a wage of  per hour  per year and would have remained so employed until retirement that her employer would have provided additional contributions amounting to  of her income in the form of a “k” or similar retirement benefit that her income would increase at  percent per year and that pomeroy her dependent adult son would have continued to live  years into the future even though the witness knew that he had died before trial the defendants also objected to the witness’ failure to consider the life expectancy of the decedent’s husband in arriving at the economic value of her lost household services” based on that summary the virginia supreme court held “because the expert testimony was based upon fictional assumptions not supported by the evidence it was speculative and unreliable as a matter of law and should have been stricken” the decision was remanded to a lower court for a new trial limited to the issue of damages  suggested by michael j piette washington state v copeland  pd  wash  the washington supreme court retained the frye standard in lieu of daubert saying that the application of frye in that state has not been so difficult as to call for its abandonment state v riker  pd  wash  the washington supreme court while formally retaining the frye standard expressly incorporated some daubert factors into frye jurisprudence west virginia craighead v norfolk and western railway co  wva   sed  dr michael brookshire’s testimony about lost earnings was challenged as speculative because the plaintiff had been unemployed for six to nine months prior to his death in a train accident the decedent had taken the army admission test and been placed in category  which was not being taken at the time of death but was being taken six months later the projection of lost earnings was based on the vocational experts opinion that the plaintiff would have served  years in the army  the west virginia supreme court found this testimony as not unduly speculative return to main page comments or questions

about  in coverage why this amount or any amount for that matter the answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event

insurance term life insurance a term life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium a term life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments this type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children people with debt obligations and also home buyers it can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy the premiums are based on your age and your health status purchasing a new term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues term life is a death benefit only policy that you buy for a specified length of time think of it like leasing a car you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over you return the car term life is referred to as benefit only insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as whole life it carries no cash surrender value because of this term life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check it is ideal for families that are just starting out or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected but may not be able to afford or desire a permanent life policy however understand that as a person ages over the period of the term monthly premiums may increase it is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse or for single people even for children just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered there are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a term life policy can make up for the investment component of a permanent life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own the earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy annual renewable term life policies are those that are purchased yearbyyear the next year you do not have to prequalify simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate rates for annual renewable policies are at historic lows a young healthy person can get  for only a few hundred dollars per year there are very good rates these days on term life the premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term usually   or  years it is not uncommon for a healthy nonsmoking  yearold male to obtain a  or year policy with a fixed premium of less than  per month so just how much insurance should you buy many things factor into that answer but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least  years of your present salary if you have young children make that around  years so if you make  a year that means at least  to  in coverage
