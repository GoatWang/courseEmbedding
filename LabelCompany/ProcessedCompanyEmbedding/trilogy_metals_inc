states investors   unless otherwise indicated all resource estimates and any future reserve estimates included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k have been and will be prepared in accordance with canadian national instrument  standards of disclosure for mineral projects “ni ” and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum definition standards for mineral resources and mineral reserves “cim definition standards” ni  is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects ni  permits the disclosure of an historical estimate made prior to the adoption of ni  that does not comply with ni  to be disclosed using the historical terminology if the disclosure a identifies the source and date of the historical estimate b comments on the relevance and reliability of the historical estimate c to the extent known provides the key assumptions parameters and methods used to prepare the historical estimate d states whether the historical estimate uses categories other than those prescribed by ni  and e includes any more recent estimates or data available   canadian standards including ni  differ significantly from the requirements of the sec and reserve and resource information contained or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by us companies in particular and without limiting the generality of the foregoing the term “resource” does not equate to the term “reserves” under sec industry guide  mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made sec industry guide  does not define and the sec’s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning “measured mineral resources” “indicated mineral resources” or “inferred mineral resources” or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute “reserves” by us standards in documents filed with the sec us investors should also understand that “inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an “inferred mineral resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimated “inferred mineral resources” may not form the basis of feasibility or prefeasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an “inferred mineral resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of “contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations however the sec normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute “reserves” by sec standards as inplace tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures the requirements of ni  for identification of “reserves” are also not the same as those of the sec and any reserves reported by us in the future in compliance with ni  may not qualify as “reserves” under sec standards accordingly information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable to information made public by companies that report in accordance with united states standards          cautionary note to all investors concerning economic assessments that include inferred resources   mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no demonstrated economic viability the preliminary assessment on the arctic project is preliminary in nature and includes “inferred mineral resources” that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves there is no certainty that the feasibility studies or preliminary assessments at the arctic project will ever be realized        glossary of technical terms   we estimate and report our resources and we will estimate and report our reserves according to the definitions set forth in ni  we will modify and reconcile the reserves

for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate at the time of reporting that the extraction is reasonably justified economically mineable the results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with or finance the development of the project the confidence level of the study will be higher than that of a prefeasibility study   “ indicated mineral resource ” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation an indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a measured mineral resource and may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve   “ inferred mineral resource ” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity an inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration   “ measured mineral resource ” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation a measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource it may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve   “ mineral reserve ” means the economically mineable part of a measured andor indicated mineral resource it includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at prefeasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors such studies demonstrate that at the time of reporting extraction could reasonably be justified the reference point at which mineral reserves are defined usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant must be stated it is important that in all situations where the reference point is different such as for a saleable product a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported the public disclosure of a mineral reserve must be demonstrated by a prefeasibility or feasibility study   “ mineral resource ” means a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the earth’s crust in such form grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction the location quantity grade or quality continuity and other geologic characteristics of a mineral resource are known estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge including sampling      ni  refers to cim definition standards with respect to the definitions of “feasibility study” “indicated mineral resource” “inferred mineral resource” “measured mineral resource” “mineral reserve” “mineral resource” “modifying factors” “prefeasibility study” “probable mineral reserve” and “proven mineral reserve” the cim definition standards adopted by cim council on may   were the relevant standards in effect at the time of the preparation of the current bornite report defined herein        “ modifying factors ” means the considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves these include but are not restricted to mining processing metallurgical infrastructure economic marketing legal environmental social and governmental factors   “ prefeasibility study preliminary feasibility study ” means a comprehensive study or a range of options for the technical and economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a preferred mining method in the case of underground mining or the pit configuration in the case of an open pit is established and an effective method of mineral processing is determined it includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions on the modifying factors and the evaluation of any other relevant factors which are sufficient for a qualified person acting reasonably to determine if all or part of the mineral resource many be converted to a mineral reserve at the time of reporting a prefeasibility study is at a lower confidence level than a feasibility study   “ probable mineral reserve ” means the economically mineable part of an indicated and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource the confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve   “ proven mineral reserve ” means the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource a proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors   cim definition standards adopted by cim council on november       “ indicated mineral resource ” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed   “ inferred mineral resource ” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence limited sampling and reasonably assumed but not verified geological and grade continuity the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes   “ measured mineral resource ” means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics are so wellestablished that they can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for both geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assured   “ mineral reserve ” means the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study this study must include adequate information on mining processing metallurgical economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate at the time of reporting that economic extraction can be justified a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined   “ mineral resource ” means a concentration or occurrence of natural solid inorganic material or natural solid fossilized organic material in or on the earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction the location quantity grade geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge      ni  refers to cim definition standards with respect to the definitions of “indicated mineral resource” “inferred mineral resource” “measured mineral resource” “mineral reserve” “mineral resource” “probable mineral reserve” and “proven mineral reserve” the cim definition standards adopted by cim council on november   were the relevant standards in effect at the time of the preparation of the arctic project pea defined herein        “ probable mineral reserve ” means the economically mineable part of an indicated and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study this study must include adequate information on mining processing metallurgical economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate at the time of reporting that economic extraction can be justified   “ proven mineral reserve ” means the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study this study must include adequate information on mining processing metallurgical economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate at the time of reporting that economic extraction is justified   sec industry guide  definitions   “ exploration stage ” deposit is one which is not in either the development or production stage   “ development stage ” project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study   “ mineralized material ” refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction   “ probable reserve ” refers to reserves for which quantity and grade andor quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves but the sites for inspection sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation   “ production stage ” project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product   “ proven reserve ” refers to reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are wellestablished   “ reserve ” refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction “bankable standards” implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing a reserve includes adjustments to the insitu tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined        part i   item  business   our principal business is the exploration and development of our upper kobuk mineral projects “upper kobuk mineral projects” or “ukmp projects” located in the ambler mining district in northwest alaska united states comprising the i arctic project which contains a highgrade polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulfide “vms” deposit “arctic project” and ii bornite project which contains a carbonatehosted copper deposit “bornite project” our goals include expanding mineral resources and advancing our projects through technical engineering and feasibility studies so that production decisions can be made on those projects our ukmp projects are held by a whollyowned subsidiary novacopper us inc “novacopper us” dba trilogy metals us registered to do business in the state of alaska   name address and incorporation   trilogy metals inc was incorporated on april   under the name novacopper inc pursuant to the terms of the business corporations act british columbia “bcbca” novacopper inc changed its name to trilogy metals inc on september   to better reflect its diversified metals resource base our registered office is located at suite  three bentall centre  burrard street vancouver british columbia canada and our executive office is located at suite   dunsmuir street vancouver british columbia canada    corporate organization chart   the following chart depicts our corporate structure together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of our subsidiary at november   all ownership is    click to enlarge         business cycle   our business at its current exploration phase is cyclical exploration activities are conducted primarily during snowfree months in alaska the optimum field season at the upper kobuk mineral projects is from late may to late september the length of the snowfree season at the upper kobuk mineral projects varies from about may through november at lower elevations and from july through september at higher elevations   trilogy’s strategy   our business strategy is focused on creating value for stakeholders through our ownership and advancement of the arctic project and exploration of the bornite project and through the pursuit of similarly attractive mining projects we plan to   · advance the arctic project towards development with key activities including increased definition of the ni  mineral resources technical studies to support completion of a prefeasibility or feasibility study and the advancement of baseline environmental studies   · advance exploration in the ambler mining district and in particular at the bornite project pursuant to the nana agreement as more particularly described under “ history of trilogy – agreement with nana regional corporation ” through resource development and initial technical studies and   · pursue project level or corporate transactions that are value accretive   the arctic project pea represents an early stage study and highlights certain opportunities for us to further expand upon prior to commencing production further studies that demonstrate the economic viability of the arctic project must be completed including prefeasibility or feasibility studies all necessary permits must be obtained a production decision must be made by our board of directors the “board” financing for construction and development must be arranged and construction must be completed in addition we will be required to address certain infrastructure challenges including a road for access transportation of supplies and mineral concentrate and obtain additional rights including surface use rights and access rights see “ item a risk factors ”   significant developments in    · on april   we released an updated resource estimate on the bornite project and on may   filed the ni  compliant bornite report as defined herein shallow mineralization located in the ruby creek zones in the upper and lower reefs are reported within a resource limiting pit shell indicated inpit resources at the bornite deposit at a  copper cutoff are  million tonnes at  copper grade inferred inpit resources at the bornite deposit at a  copper cutoff are  million tonnes at  copper grade in addition to the inpit resources inferred below pit resources at the bornite deposit are reported at an elevated  copper cutoff as  million tonnes at  copper grade contained copper in indicated resources has increased from  to  million pounds constituting a  increase in contained metal total contained copper in inferred resources has decreased from  to  million pounds mlbs inpit and mlbs belowpit which constitutes a  decrease in contained metal due principally to moving inpit inferred resources to the indicated category the update incorporated a new d lithology alteration and structural model for the bornite deposit as well as results from previously unsampled or partially sampled historical kennecott drill core inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and whether they can be mined legally or economically it cannot be assumed that all or any part of the inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability see “cautionary note to united states investors”   · on august   we announced the sale of our whollyowned subsidiary sunward investments ltd “sunward investments” which indirectly owns the titiribi property located in antioquia province of colombia to brazil resources inc “bri” in exchange for  million common shares of bri and  million warrants each warrant is exercisable into one common share of bri at a price of c per bri common share until september   on september   the close of the transaction the consideration was valued at  million        · on september   the change of our name to trilogy metals inc which was previously approved by our shareholders became effective and our shares began trading on the tsx and the nysemkt under the new name and symbol “tmq” we changed our name to trilogy to better reflect the diversity of minerals at our ukmp projects   · on october   we released the drill results from the safe and successful  summer field program for the arctic project we completed thirteen diamond drill holes for a total of  meters of

at a special meeting of securityholders of novagold held on march   the securityholders voted in favour of a special resolution approving the distribution of common shares of trilogy to the shareholders of novagold as a return of capital through a statutory plan of arrangement under the companies act nova scotia   on april   all of the outstanding trilogy common shares were distributed to shareholders of novagold such that each novagold shareholder of record at the close of business on april   received one trilogy common share for every six common shares in the capital of novagold held at that time the trilogy common shares were listed and posted for trading on the tsx and on the nysemkt under its previous symbol ncq and former name novacopper on april     name change   we changed our corporate name to trilogy metals inc from novacopper inc in  to better reflect the diversity of minerals at our ukmp projects on september   upon the opening of the markets our shares began trading on the tsx and the nysemkt under the symbol “tmq”   agreement with nana regional corporation   on october   nana regional corporation inc “nana” an alaska native corporation headquartered in kotzebue alaska and novacopper us entered an exploration agreement and option agreement as amended the “nana agreement” for the cooperative development of nana’s respective resource interests in the ambler mining district of northwest alaska the nana agreement consolidates our and nana’s land holdings into an approximately hectare land package and provides a framework for the exploration and any future development of this highgrade and prospective polymetallic belt        the nana agreement grants novacopper us the nonexclusive right to enter on and the exclusive right to explore the bornite lands and the alaska native claims settlement act “ancsa” lands each as defined in the nana agreement and in connection therewith to construct and utilize temporary access roads camps airstrips and other incidental works in consideration for this right novacopper us paid to nana  million in cash novacopper us is also required to make payments to nana for scholarship purposes in accordance with the terms of the nana agreement novacopper us has further agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to train and employ nana shareholders to perform work for novacopper us in connection with its operations on the bornite lands ancsa lands and ambler lands as defined in the nana agreement collectively the “lands” under the nana agreement nana also has the right to appoint a board member to trilogy’s board within a five year period following our public listing on a stock exchange   the nana agreement has a term of  years with an option in favour of novacopper us to extend the term for an additional  years the nana agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or by nana if novacopper us does not meet certain expenditure requirements on the bornite lands and ancsa lands   if following receipt of a feasibility study and the release for public comment of a related draft environmental impact statement we decide to proceed with construction of a mine on the lands novacopper us will notify nana in writing and nana will have  days to elect to either a exercise a nontransferrable backinright to acquire an undivided ownership interest between  and  as specified by nana of that specific project or b not exercise its backinright and instead receive a net proceeds royalty equal to  of the net proceeds realized by novacopper us from such project following the recoupment by novacopper us of all costs incurred including operating capital and carrying costs the cost to exercise such backinright is equal to the percentage interest in the project multiplied by the difference between i all costs incurred by novacopper us or its affiliates on the project including historical costs incurred prior to the date of the nana agreement together with interest on the costs and ii  million subject to exceptions this amount will be payable by nana to novacopper us in cash at the time the parties enter into a joint venture agreement and in no event will the amount be less than zero   in the event that nana elects to exercise its backinright the parties will as soon as reasonably practicable form a joint venture with nana’s interest being between  to  and novacopper us owning the balance of the interest in the joint venture upon formation of the joint venture the joint venture will assume all of the obligations of novacopper us and be entitled to all the benefits of novacopper us under the nana agreement in connection with the mine to be developed and the related lands a party’s failure to pay its proportionate share of costs in connection with the joint venture will result in dilution of its interest each party will have a right of first refusal over any proposed transfer of the other party’s interest in the joint venture other than to an affiliate or for the purposes of granting security a transfer by either party of any net proceeds royalty interest in a project other than for financing purposes will also be subject to a first right of refusal a transfer of nana’s net smelter return on the lands is subject to a first right of refusal by novacopper us   in connection with possible development of a mine on the bornite lands or ancsa lands novacopper us and nana will execute a mining lease to allow novacopper us or the joint venture to construct and operate a mine on the bornite lands or ancsa lands these leases will provide nana a  net smelter royalty as to production from the bornite lands and a  net smelter royalty as to production from the ancsa lands if novacopper us decides to proceed with construction of a mine on the ambler lands nana will enter into a surface use agreement with novacopper us which will afford novacopper us access to the ambler lands along routes approved by nana on the bornite lands or ancsa lands in consideration for the grant of such surface use rights novacopper us will grant nana a  net smelter royalty on production and an annual payment of  per acre as adjusted for inflation each year beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the nana agreement and for each of the first  acres and  for each additional acre of the lands owned by nana and used for access which are disturbed and not reclaimed   we have formed an oversight committee with nana which consists of four representatives from each of trilogy and nana the “oversight committee” the oversight committee is responsible for certain planning and oversight matters carried out by us under the nana agreement the planning and oversight matters that are the subject of the nana agreement will be determined by majority vote the representatives of each of trilogy and nana attending a meeting will have one vote in the aggregate and in the event of a tie the trilogy representatives jointly shall have a deciding vote on all matters other than subsistence matters as that term is defined in the nana agreement there shall be no deciding vote on subsistence matters and we may not proceed with such matters unless approved by majority vote of the oversight committee or with the consent of nana such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed        principal markets   we do not currently have a principal market our principal objective is to become a producer of copper   specialized skill and knowledge   all aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology mining and accounting see “ executive officers of trilogy ” for details as to the specific skills and knowledge of our directors and management   environmental protection   mining is an extractive industry that impacts the environment our goal is to evaluate ways to minimize that impact and to develop safe responsible and profitable operations by developing natural resources for the benefit of our employees shareholders and communities and maintain high standards for environmental performance at our ukmp projects we strive to meet or exceed environmental standards at our ukmp projects one way we do this is through collaborations with local communities in alaska including native alaskan groups our environmental performance will be overseen at the board level and environmental performance is the responsibility of the project manager   · all new activities and operations will be managed for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the absence of regulation best management practices will be applied to manage environmental risk   · we will strive to limit releases to the air land

operations segment information relating to our assets is provided under the section heading “ item  financial statements and supplementary data ” below   competitive conditions   the mineral exploration and development industry is competitive in all phases of exploration development and production there is a high degree of competition faced by us in alaska and elsewhere for skilled management employees suitable contractors for drilling operations technical and engineering resources and necessary exploration and mining equipment and many of these competitor companies have greater financial resources operational expertise andor more advanced properties than us additionally our operations are in a remote location where skilled resources and support services are limited we have in place experienced management personnel and continue to evaluate the required expertise and skills to carry out our operations as a result of this competition we may be unable to achieve our exploration and development in the future on terms we consider acceptable or at all see “ item a risk factors ”   available information   we make available free of charge on or through our website at

investing in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk due to the nature of our business and the present stage of exploration of our mineral properties the following risk factors as well as risks currently unknown to us could materially adversely affect our future business operations and financial condition and could cause them to differ materially from the estimates described in forwardlooking information relating to trilogy or our business property or financial results each of which could cause purchasers of securities to lose all or part of their investments        we have not defined any proven or probable reserves and none of our mineral properties are in production or under development   we have no history of commercially producing precious or base metals and all of our properties are in the exploration stage we have not defined or delineated any measured mineral resources or proven or probable reserves on our upper kobuk mineral projects mineral exploration involves significant risk since few properties that are explored contain bodies of ore that would be commercially economic to develop into producing mines we cannot assure you that we will establish the presence of any measured resources or proven or probable reserves at the upper kobuk mineral projects or any other properties the failure to establish measured mineral resources or proven or probable reserves would severely restrict our ability to implement our strategies for longterm growth   we may not have sufficient funds to develop our mineral projects or to complete further exploration programs   we have limited financial resources we currently generate no mining operating revenue and must primarily finance exploration activity and the development of mineral projects by other means in the future our ability to continue exploration development and production activities if any will depend on our ability to obtain additional external financing any unexpected costs problems or delays could severely impact our ability to continue exploration and development activities the failure to meet ongoing obligations on a timely basis could result in a loss or a substantial dilution of our interests in projects   the sources of external financing that we may use for these purposes include project or bank financing or public or private offerings of equity and debt in addition we may enter into one or more strategic alliances or joint ventures decide to sell certain property interests or utilize one or a combination of all of these alternatives the financing alternative we choose may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if additional financing is not available we may have to postpone further exploration or development of or sell one or more of our principal properties   even if one of our mineral projects is determined to be economically viable to develop into a mine such development may not be successful   if the development of one of our projects is found to be economically feasible and approved by our board such development will require obtaining permits and financing the construction and operation of mines processing plants and related infrastructure including road access as a result we are and will continue to be subject to all of the risks associated with establishing new mining operations including   · the timing and cost which can be considerable of the construction of mining and processing facilities and related infrastructure   · the availability and cost of skilled labor and mining equipment   · the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and refining arrangements   · the need to obtain necessary environmental and other governmental approvals and permits and the timing of the receipt of those approvals and permits   · the availability of funds to finance construction and development activities   · potential opposition from nongovernmental organizations environmental groups or local groups which may delay or prevent development activities and   · potential increases in construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel power materials and supplies   the costs timing and complexities of developing our projects may be greater than anticipated because our property interests are not located in developed areas and as a result our property interests are not currently served by appropriate road access water and power supply and other support infrastructure cost estimates may increase significantly as more detailed engineering work is completed on a project it is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected costs problems and delays during construction development and mine startup in addition delays in the early stages of mineral production often occur accordingly we cannot provide assurance that we will ever achieve or that our activities will result in profitable mining operations at our mineral properties        in addition there can be no assurance that our mineral exploration activities will result in any discoveries of new mineralization if further mineralization is discovered there is also no assurance that the mineralization would be economical for commercial production discovery of mineral deposits is dependent upon a number of factors and significantly influenced by the technical skill of the exploration personnel involved the commercial viability of a mineral deposit is also dependent upon a number of factors which are beyond our control including the attributes of the deposit commodity prices government policies and regulation and environmental protection   the upper kobuk mineral projects are located in a remote area of alaska and access to them is limited exploration and any future development or production activities may be limited and delayed by infrastructure challenges inclement weather and a shortened exploration season   the upper kobuk mineral projects are located in a remote area of alaska access to the upper kobuk mineral projects is limited and there is currently no infrastructure in the area   we cannot provide assurances that the proposed amdiap that would provide access to the ambler mining district will be permitted or built that it will be built in a timely manner that the cost of accessing the proposed road will be reasonable that it will be built in the manner contemplated or that it will sufficiently satisfy the requirements of the upper kobuk mineral projects in addition successful development of the upper kobuk mineral projects will require the development of the necessary infrastructure if adequate infrastructure is not available in a timely manner there can be no assurance that   · the development of the upper kobuk mineral projects will be commenced or completed on a timely basis if at all   · the resulting operations will achieve the anticipated production volume or   · the construction costs and operating costs associated with the development of the upper kobuk mineral projects will not be higher than anticipated   as the upper kobuk mineral projects are located in a remote area exploration development and production activities may be limited and delayed by inclement weather and a shortened exploration season   we have no history of production and no revenue from mining operations   we have a very limited history of operations and to date have generated no revenue from mining operations as such we are subject to many risks common to such enterprises including undercapitalization cash shortages limitations with respect to personnel financial and other resources and lack of significant revenues there is no assurance that the upper kobuk mineral projects or any other future projects will be commercially mineable and we may never generate revenues from our mining operations   future sales or issuances of equity securities could decrease the value of any existing common shares dilute investors’ voting power and reduce our earnings per share   we may sell additional equity securities including through the sale of securities convertible into common shares and may issue additional equity securities to finance our operations exploration development acquisitions or other projects we are authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares we cannot predict the size of future sales and issuances of equity securities or the effect if any that future sales and issuances of equity securities will have on the market price of the common shares sales or issuances of a substantial number of equity securities or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common shares with any additional sale or issuance of equity securities investors will suffer dilution of their voting power and may experience dilution in our earnings per share   changes in the market price of copper gold and other metals which in the past have fluctuated widely will affect our ability to finance continued exploration and development of our projects and affect our operations and financial condition   our longterm viability will depend in large part on the market price of copper gold and other metals the market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including        · global or regional consumption patterns   · the supply of and demand for these metals   · speculative activities   · the availability and costs of metal substitutes   · expectations for inflation and   · political and economic conditions including interest rates and currency values   we cannot predict the effect of these factors on metal prices a decrease in the market price of copper gold and other metals could affect our ability to raise funds to finance the exploration and development of any of our mineral projects which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the market price of copper gold and other metals may not remain at current levels in particular an increase in worldwide supply and consequent downward pressure on prices may result over the longer term from increased copper production from mines developed or expanded as a result of current metal price levels there is no assurance that a profitable market may exist or continue to exist   actual capital costs operating costs production and economic returns may differ significantly from those described in the pea   the pea technical report for the arctic project is an early stage study that is preliminary in nature there can be no assurance that the results described in the pea will be realized the capital costs to take our projects into production may be significantly higher than anticipated   none of our mineral properties have an operating history upon which we can base estimates of future operating costs decisions about the development of the arctic project or the bornite project will ultimately be based upon feasibility studies feasibility studies derive estimates of cash operating costs based upon among other things   · anticipated tonnage grades and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed   · anticipated recovery rates of metals from the ore   · cash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment and   · anticipated climatic conditions   cash operating costs production and economic returns and other estimates contained in studies or estimates prepared by or for us may differ significantly from those anticipated by the pea and there can be no assurance that our actual operating costs will not be higher than currently anticipated   we will incur losses for the foreseeable future   we expect to incur losses unless and until such time as our mineral projects generate sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations the exploration and development of our mineral properties will require the commitment of substantial financial resources that may not be available   the amount and timing of expenditures will depend on a number of factors including the progress of ongoing exploration and development the results of consultants’ analyses and recommendations the rate at which operating losses are incurred the execution of any joint venture agreements with strategic partners and the acquisition of additional property interests some of which are beyond our control we cannot provide assurance that we will ever achieve profitability      mineral resource and reserve calculations are only estimates   any figures presented for mineral resources in this form k and in our other filings with securities regulatory authorities and those which may be presented in the future or any figures for mineral reserves that may be presented by us in the future are and will only be estimates there is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of mineral reserves and mineral resources until mineral reserves or mineral resources are actually mined and processed the quantity of metal and grades must be considered as estimates only and no assurances can be given that the indicated levels of metals will be produced in making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development we must rely upon estimated calculations as to the mineral resources and grades of mineralization on our properties   the estimating of mineral reserves and mineral resources is a subjective process that relies on the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates the process relies on the quantity and quality of available data and is based on knowledge mining experience analysis of drilling results and industry practices valid estimates made at a given time may significantly change when new information becomes available while we believe that the mineral resource estimates included in this form k for the upper kobuk mineral projects are wellestablished and reflect management’s best estimates by their nature mineral resource estimates are imprecise and depend to a certain extent upon analysis of drilling results and statistical inferences that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate there can be no assurances that actual results will meet the estimates contained in feasibility studies as well further studies are required   estimated mineral reserves or mineral resources may have to be recalculated based on changes in metal prices further exploration or development activity or actual production experience this could materially and adversely affect estimates of the volume or grade of mineralization estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates the extent to which mineral resources may ultimately be reclassified as mineral reserves is dependent upon the demonstration of their profitable recovery any material changes in mineral resource estimates and grades of mineralization will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and a property’s return on capital we cannot provide assurance that mineralization can be mined or processed profitably   our mineral resource estimates have been determined and valued based on assumed future metal prices cutoff grades and operating costs that may prove to be inaccurate extended declines in market prices for copper zinc lead gold and silver may render portions of our mineralization uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineral resources which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we cannot provide assurance that mineral recovery rates achieved in small scale tests will be duplicated in large scale tests under onsite conditions or in production scale   a reduction in any mineral reserves that may be estimated by us in the future could have an adverse impact on our future cash flows earnings results of operations and financial condition no assurances can be given that any mineral resource estimates for the upper kobuk mineral projects will ultimately be reclassified as mineral reserves see “ cautionary note to united states investors ”   significant uncertainty exists related to inferred mineral resources   there is a risk that inferred mineral resources referred to in this form k cannot be converted into measured or indicated mineral resources as there may be limited ability to assess geological continuity due to the uncertainty that may attach to inferred mineral resources there is no assurance that inferred mineral resources will be upgraded to resources with sufficient geological continuity to constitute proven and probable mineral reserves as a result of continued exploration see “ cautionary note to united states investors ”   mining is inherently risky and subject to conditions or events beyond our control   the development and operation of a mine is inherently dangerous and involves many risks that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome including   · unusual or unexpected geological formations   · metallurgical and other processing problems      · metal losses   · environmental hazards   · power outages   · labor disruptions   · industrial accidents   · periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions   · flooding explosions fire rockbursts caveins and landslides   · mechanical equipment and facility performance problems and   · the availability of materials and equipment   these risks could result in damage to or destruction of mineral properties production facilities or other properties personal injury or death including to our employees environmental damage delays in mining increased production costs asset write downs monetary losses and possible legal liability we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums or at all insurance against certain environmental risks including potential liability for pollution and other hazards associated with mineral exploration and production is not generally available to companies within the mining industry we may suffer a material adverse effect on our business if we incur losses related to any significant events that are not covered by our insurance policies   general economic conditions may adversely affect our growth future profitability and ability to finance   the unprecedented events in global financial markets in the past several years have had a profound impact on the global economy many industries including the copper mining industry are impacted by these market conditions some of the key impacts of the current financial market turmoil include contraction in credit markets resulting in a widening of credit risk devaluations high volatility in global equity commodity foreign exchange and precious metal markets and a lack of market liquidity a worsening or slowdown in the financial markets or other economic conditions including but not limited to consumer spending employment rates business conditions inflation fuel and energy costs consumer debt levels lack of available credit the state of the financial markets interest rates and tax rates may adversely affect our growth and ability to finance specifically   · the volatility of copper gold and other metal prices would impact our estimates of mineral resources revenues profits losses and cash flow and the feasibility of our projects   · negative economic pressures could adversely impact demand for our future production if any   · construction related costs could increase and adversely affect the economics of any project   · volatile energy commodity and consumables prices and currency exchange rates would impact our estimated production costs and   · the devaluation and volatility of global stock markets would impact the valuation of our equity and other securities   we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully acquire commercially mineable mineral rights   exploration for and development of copper and gold properties involves significant financial risks which even a combination of careful evaluation experience and knowledge may not eliminate while the discovery of an ore body may result in substantial rewards few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines major expenses may be required to establish reserves by drilling constructing mining and processing facilities at a site developing metallurgical processes and extracting metals from ore we cannot ensure that our current exploration and development programs will result in profitable commercial mining operations      the economic feasibility of development projects is based upon many factors including the accuracy of mineral resource estimates metallurgical recoveries capital and operating costs government regulations relating to prices taxes royalties land tenure land use importing and exporting and environmental protection and metal prices which are highly volatile development projects are also subject to the successful completion of feasibility studies issuance of necessary governmental permits and availability of adequate financing   most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any anticipated level of recovery of ore reserves if any will be realized or that any identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable or viable ore body which can be legally and economically exploited estimates of mineral reserves mineral resources mineral deposits and production costs can also be affected by such factors as environmental permitting regulations and requirements weather environmental factors unforeseen technical difficulties the metallurgy of the mineralization forming the mineral deposit unusual or unexpected geological formations and work interruptions if current exploration programs do not result in the discovery of commercial ore we may need to writeoff part or all of our investment in our existing exploration stage properties and may need to acquire additional properties   material changes in mineral reserves if any grades stripping ratios or recovery rates may affect the economic viability of any project our future growth and productivity will depend in part on our ability to develop commercially mineable mineral rights at our existing properties or identify and acquire other commercially mineable mineral rights and on the costs and results of continued exploration and potential development programs mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and is frequently nonproductive substantial expenditures are required to   · establish mineral reserves through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques   · determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to extract metal from the ore and   · construct renovate or expand mining and processing facilities   in addition if we discover ore it would take several years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible during this time the economic feasibility of production may change as a result of these uncertainties there can be no assurance that we will successfully acquire commercially mineable or viable mineral rights   we are subject to significant governmental regulations   our exploration activities are subject to extensive federal state provincial and local laws and regulations governing various matters including   · environmental protection   · the management and use of toxic substances and explosives   · the management of natural resources   · the exploration and development of mineral properties including reclamation   · exports   · price controls   · taxation and mining royalties   · management of tailing and other waste generated by operations   · labor standards and occupational health and safety including mine safety and   · historic and cultural preservation      failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining curtailing or closing operations or requiring corrective measures installation of additional equipment or remedial actions any of which could result in significant expenditures we may also be required to compensate private parties suffering loss or damage by reason of a breach of such laws regulations or permitting requirements it is also possible that future laws and regulations or more stringent enforcement of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities could cause us to incur additional expense or capital expenditure restrictions suspensions or closing of our activities and delays in the exploration and development of our properties   we require further permits in order to conduct current and anticipated future operations and delays in obtaining or failure to obtain such permits or a failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have obtained would adversely affect our business   our current and anticipated future operations including further exploration development and commencement of production on our mineral properties require permits from various governmental authorities obtaining or renewing governmental permits is a complex and timeconsuming process the duration and success of efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control due to the preliminary stages of the upper kobuk mineral projects it is difficult to assess what specific permitting requirements will ultimately apply   shortage of qualified and experienced personnel in the us federal and alaskan state agencies to coordinate a federally led joint environmental impact statement process could result in delays or inefficiencies backlog within the permitting agencies could affect the permitting timeline or potential of the upper kobuk mineral projects as may negative public perception of mining projects in general due to circumstances unrelated to the company and outside of its control other factors that could affect the permitting timeline include i the number of other largescale projects currently in a more advanced stage of development which could slow down the review process for the upper kobuk mineral projects and ii significant public response regarding the upper kobuk mineral projects   we cannot provide assurance that all permits that we require for our operations including any for construction of mining facilities or conduct of mining will be obtainable or renewable on reasonable terms or at all delays or a failure to obtain such required permits or the expiry revocation or failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have obtained would adversely affect our business   our activities are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs and restrict our operations   all of our exploration potential development and production activities are subject to regulation by governmental agencies under various environmental laws these laws address emissions into the air discharges into water management of waste management of hazardous substances protection of natural resources antiquities and endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining operations environmental legislation is evolving and the general trend has been towards stricter standards and enforcement increased fines and penalties for noncompliance more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and increasing responsibility for companies and their officers directors and employees compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant capital outlays on our behalf and may cause material changes or delays in our intended activities   several regulatory initiatives are currently ongoing within the state of alaska that have the potential to influence the permitting process for the upper kobuk mineral projects these include revisions to alaskas water quality standards regarding mixing zones regulations which are currently under epa review and which revisions may be required in order to authorize a mixing zone for discharge in subarctic creek future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant adverse impact on some portion of our business requiring us to reevaluate those activities at that time   environmental hazards may exist on our properties that are unknown to us at the present time and that have been caused by previous owners or operators or that may have occurred naturally we may be liable for remediating such damage   failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions thereunder including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or to be curtailed and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures installation of additional equipment or remedial actions      land reclamation requirements for our exploration properties may be burdensome   land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies as well as companies with mining operations in order to minimize long term effects of land disturbance reclamation may include requirements to   · treat ground and surface water to drinking water standards   · control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents and   · reasonably reestablish predisturbance land forms and vegetation   in order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with exploration potential development and production activities we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration and development programs in addition regulatory changes could increase our obligations to perform reclamation and mine closing activities if we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work our financial position could be adversely affected   title and other rights to our properties may be subject to challenge   we cannot provide assurance that title to our properties will not be challenged we own mineral claims which constitute our property holdings we may not have or may not be able to obtain all necessary surface rights to develop a property title insurance is generally not available for mineral properties and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mining properties may be severely constrained our mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements transfers or claims and title may be affected by among other things undetected defects we have not conducted surveys of all of the claims in which we hold direct or indirect interests a successful claim contesting our title to a property will cause us to lose our rights to explore and if warranted develop that property or undertake or continue production thereon this could result in our not being compensated for our prior expenditures relating to the property in addition our ability to continue to explore and develop the property may be subject to agreements with other third parties including agreements with native corporations and first nations groups for instance the lands at the upper kobuk mineral projects are subject to the nana agreement as more particularly described under “ history of trilogy – agreement with nana regional corporation ”   risks inherent in acquisitions of new properties   we may actively pursue the acquisition of exploration development and production assets consistent with our acquisition and growth strategy from time to time we may also acquire securities of or other interests in companies with respect to which we may enter into acquisitions or other transactions acquisition transactions involve inherent risks including but not limited to   · accurately assessing the value strengths weaknesses contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates   · ability to achieve identified and anticipated operating and financial synergies   · unanticipated costs   · diversion of management attention from existing business   · potential loss of our key employees or key employees of any business acquired   · unanticipated changes in business industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition   · decline in the value of acquired properties companies or securities   · assimilating the operations of an acquired business or property in a timely and efficient manner      · maintaining our financial and strategic focus while integrating the acquired business or property   · implementing uniform standards controls procedures and policies at the acquired business as appropriate and   · to the extent that we make an acquisition outside of markets in which it has previously operated conducting and managing operations in a new operating environment   acquiring additional businesses or properties could place increased pressure on our cash flow if such acquisitions involve a cash consideration the integration of our existing operations with any acquired business will require significant expenditures of time attention and funds achievement of the benefits expected from consolidation would require us to incur significant costs in connection with among other things implementing financial and planning systems we may not be able to integrate the operations of a recently acquired business or restructure our previously existing business operations without encountering difficulties and delays in addition this integration may require significant attention from our management team which may detract attention from our daytoday operations over the shortterm difficulties associated with integration could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the price of trilogy shares in addition the acquisition of mineral properties may subject us to unforeseen liabilities including environmental liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on us there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our existing operations   any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   high metal prices in past years have encouraged increased mining exploration development and construction activity which has increased demand for and cost of exploration development and construction services and equipment   the relative strength of metal prices in past years has encouraged increases in mining exploration development and construction activities around the world which has resulted in increased demand for and cost of exploration development and construction services and equipment while recent market conditions have had a moderating effect on the costs of such services and equipment increases in such costs may continue with the resumption of an upward trend in metal prices increased demand for and cost of services and equipment could result in delays if services or equipment cannot be obtained in a timely manner due to inadequate availability and may cause scheduling difficulties due to the need to coordinate the availability of services or equipment any of which could materially increase project exploration development andor construction costs   we face industry competition in the acquisition of exploration properties and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel   we compete with other exploration and producing companies many of which are better capitalized have greater financial resources operational experience and technical capabilities or are further advanced in their development or are significantly larger and have access to greater mineral reserves for the acquisition of mineral claims leases and other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and other personnel if we require and are unsuccessful in acquiring additional mineral properties or in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel we will not be able to grow at the rate we desire or at all   we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel to grow our business   we are dependent on the services of key executives and other highly skilled and experienced personnel to advance our corporate objectives as well as the identification of new opportunities for growth and funding mr van nieuwenhuyse and ms sanders are currently our only executive officers it will be necessary for us to recruit additional skilled and experienced executives our inability to do so or the loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain suitable replacements for them or additional highly skilled employees required for our activities would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition      some of our directors and officers have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies   certain of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers or have significant shareholdings in other companies involved in natural resource exploration and development or miningrelated activities including in particular novagold to the extent that such other companies may participate in ventures in which we may participate in or in ventures which we may seek to participate in our directors and officers may have a conflict of interest in negotiating and concluding terms respecting the extent of such participation in all cases where our directors and officers have an interest in other companies such other companies may also compete with us for the acquisition of mineral property investments any decision made by any of these directors and officers involving trilogy will be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of trilogy and its shareholders in addition each of the directors is required to declare and refrain from voting on any matter in which these directors may have a conflict of interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in the business corporations act british columbia and other applicable laws in appropriate cases the company will establish a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which several directors or management may have a conflict nonetheless as a result of these conflicts of interest the company may not have an opportunity to participate in certain transactions which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operation and prospects   in the future we may be subject to legal proceedings   due to the nature of our business we may be subject to numerous regulatory investigations claims lawsuits and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business the results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation including the effects of discovery of new evidence or advancement of new legal theories the difficulty of predicting decisions of judges and juries and the possibility that decisions may be reversed on appeal there can be no assurances that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business   our largest shareholder has significant influence on us and may also affect the market price and liquidity of the securities   electrum strategic opportunities fund lp “electrum” is our single largest shareholder controlling approximately  of the outstanding voting securities accordingly electrum will have significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the shareholders for approval including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other significant corporate actions unless significant participation of other shareholders takes place in such shareholder meetings electrum may be able to approve such matters itself the concentration of ownership of the shares by electrum may i delay or deter a change of control of the company ii deprive shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of the company and iii affect the market price and liquidity of the shares without the consent of electrum we could be prevented from entering into transactions that are otherwise beneficial to us the interests of electrum may differ from or be adverse to the interests of our other shareholders the effect of these rights and electrum’s influence may impact the price that investors are willing to pay for securities if electrum sells a substantial number of shares in the public market the market price of the shares could fall the perception among the public that these sales will occur could also contribute to a decline in the market price of the shares   global climate change is an international concern and could impact our ability to conduct future operations   global climate change is an international issue and receives an enormous amount of publicity we would expect that the imposition of international treaties or us or canadian federal state provincial or local laws or regulations pertaining to mandatory reductions in energy consumption or emissions of greenhouse gasses could affect the feasibility of our mining projects and increase our operating costs   adverse publicity from nongovernmental organizations could have a material adverse effect on us   there is an increasing level of public concern relating to the effect of mining production on our surroundings communities and environment nongovernmental organizations “ngos” some of which oppose resource development are often vocal critics of the mining industry while we seek to operate in a socially responsible manner adverse publicity generated by such ngos related to extractive industries or our operations specifically could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial condition or our relationship with the communities in which we operate      we may fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as per the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act   we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section  of sox it requires an annual assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we may in the future fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as such standards are modified supplemented or amended from time to time and we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section  of sox our failure to satisfy the requirements of section  of sox on an ongoing timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common shares in addition any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations future acquisitions of companies may provide us with challenges in implementing the required processes procedures and controls in our acquired operations acquired companies may not have disclosure control and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by securities laws currently applicable to us   our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price   we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of united states and canadian governmental and selfregulated organizations including the sec the canadian securities administrators the nysemkt the tsx and the financial accounting standards board these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the united states congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain our efforts to comply with new rules and regulations including those promulgated under doddfrank have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities   our common shares are subject to various factors that have historically made share prices volatile   the market price of our common shares may be subject to large fluctuations which may result in losses to investors the market price of the common shares may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors including our operating performance and the performance of competitors and other similar companies volatility in metal prices the arrival or departure of key personnel the number of common shares to be publicly traded after an offering the public’s reaction to our press releases material change reports other public announcements

district of the southern brooks range in the northwest arctic borough “nwab” of alaska the arctic project is located  km east of the town of kotzebue  km north of the village of kobuk  km west of the dalton highway an allweather state maintained public road at geographic coordinates n° latitude and w° longitude universal transverse mercator utm north american datum nad  zone  coordinates n e the current size of the ambler lands is approximately  km long x  km wide and comprises a total of  ha      the ambler lands comprise  ha of state of alaska mining claims and us federal patented mining claims in the kotzebue recording district the ambler land tenure consists of  contiguous claims including  acre state claims  acre state claims  state claims ranging from acre to acre and two federal patented claims comprising  ha held in the name of novacopper us inc the arctic project is located near the southern edge of the centre of the claim block the federal patented claim corners were located by the us geological survey there is no expiration date or labor requirement on the federal patented claims rent for each state claim is paid annually to the alaska department of natural resources “adnr” an annual labor statement must be submitted annually to maintain the state claims in good standing   in  the us congress passed the alaska native claims settlement act which settled land and financial claims made by the alaska natives and provided for the establishment of  regional corporations to administer those claims these are known as the alaska native regional corporations one of these  regional corporations is nana ancsa lands controlled by nana bound the southern border of the property claim block national park lands are within  km of the northern property border

previous operators or from our ongoing exploration activities at the arctic project there has been no mine development or production on the ambler lands   multiple permits are required during the exploration phase of the arctic project permits are issued from federal state and regional agencies including the environmental protection agency “epa” the us army corps of engineers “usace” the alaska department of environmental conservation “adec” the alaska department of fish and game “adfg” the adnr and the nwab the state of alaska permit for exploration on the arctic project the annual hardrock exploration activity “ahea” permit is obtained and renewed every five years through the adnr – division of mining land and water trilogy holds an ahea exploration permit in good standing with the alaska dnr the arctic project is within the nwab thus requiring a title  miscellaneous land use permit for mineral exploration fuel storage gravel extraction and the operation of a landfill novagold held these permits in good standing during the  to  seasons and renewed the permits for the  exploration season to  the bornite camp bornite landfill and dahl creek camp are permitted by the adec   a number of statutory reports and payments are required to maintain the claims in good standing on an annual basis as the arctic project progresses additional permits for environmental baseline and detailed engineering studies will be necessary at federal state and local levels   arctic project  accessibility climate local resources infrastructure and physiography   accessibility is one of the most significant challenges of developing the arctic project there is no developed surface access to the ambler mining district        primary access to the arctic project is by air using both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters there are four well maintained approximately  mlong gravel airstrips located near the arctic project capable of accommodating charter fixed wing aircraft these airstrips are located  km west at ambler  km southwest at shungnak  km southwest at kobuk and  km southwest at dahl creek there is daily commercial air service from kotzebue to the village of kobuk the closest community to the arctic project during the summer months the dahl creek camp airstrip is suitable for larger aircraft such as c and dc in addition to the four  m airstrips there is a  m airstrip located at the bornite camp approximately  km southwest of the arctic deposit and a  m airstrip located approximately  km southwest of the arctic deposit the airstrip at bornite is suited to smaller aircraft which support the camp with personnel and supplies an upgraded onelane gravel road suitable for vehicles or construction equipment links the bornite camp to the dahl creek airstrip and camp southwest of the arctic deposit   the climate in the region is typical of a subarctic environment exploration is generally conducted from late may until late september weather conditions on the ambler lands can vary significantly from year to year and can change suddenly during the summer exploration season average maximum temperatures range from °c to °c while average lows range from °c to °c by early october unpredictable weather limits regular helicopter travel to the arctic project during winter months the arctic project can be accessed by snow machine track vehicle or fixed wing aircraft winter temperatures are routinely below °c and can exceed °c annual precipitation in the region averages at  mm with the most rainfall occurring from june through september and the most snowfall occurring from november through january   the arctic project is located along the south slope of the brooks range which separates the arctic region from the interior of alaska nearby surface waters include subarctic creek the shungnak and kogoluktuk rivers the kobuk river and numerous small lakes the arctic project is located at the eastern end of subarctic creek a tributary of the shungnak river to the west along a ridge between subarctic creek and the kogoluktuk river valley the property area is marked by steep and rugged terrain with high topographic relief elevations range from  masl along the kobuk river to  masl on a peak immediately north of the arctic project area the divide between the shungnak and kogoluktuk rivers in the ambler lowlands is approximately  masl the kobuk valley is located at the transition between boreal forest and arctic tundra spruce birch and poplar are found in portions of the valley with a ground cover of lichens reindeer moss willow and alder thickets and isolated cottonwoods follow drainages and alpine tundra is found at higher elevations tussock tundra and low heathtype vegetation covers most of the valley floor intermittent permafrost exists on the arctic project   wildlife in the area includes caribou moose dall sheep bears grizzly and black wolves wolverines coyotes and foxes fish species include salmon sheefish arctic char and arctic grayling the kobuk river which briefly enters the ukmp lands on its southwest corner is a significant salmon spawning river subarctic creek which does not contain anadromous fish drains into the shungnak river which drains into the kobuk river the caribou on the property belong to the western arctic herd that migrates twice a year – south in august from their summer range north of the brooks range and north in march from their winter range along the buckland river   currently the arctic project does not have access to alaska power and transportation infrastructure beginning in  the arctic project has been the focus of the ambler mining district access corridor study   the arctic deposit proposed access road branches off from the proposed amdiap formerly known as the ambler mining district access road or amdiar and ends at the arctic deposit figure  shows the overall road location plan showing the relationship of the proposed access road to the proposed brooks east corridor which eventually connects to the existing dalton highway  km from the access road intersection the proposed access road is  km long from the amdiap corridor to the arctic project site        figure  proposed access to the arctic project site   click to enlarge   the proposed arctic project mine site infrastructure is spread over a distance of approximately  km within the upper reaches of the subarctic creek valley the proposed development for the arctic project consists of the following major infrastructure roads and an airstrip mill buildings and related services facilities including maintenance and truck shops assay lab water supply and distribution waste management fuel storage on site explosive storage power supply tailings storage facility “tsf” and water management water treatment plant construction and permanent camp accommodation waste rock storage facilities and communication infrastructure   the proposed minesite infrastructure has been located to take advantage of local topography minimize pumping requirements from the mill building to the tsf minimize environmental impacts to subarctic creek minimize snow avalanche mitigation requirements and to reduce the haul distance from the pit to the primary crusher and tsf   the proposed location for an airstrip sufficient to support project activities is located in the valley approximately  km from the arctic project site geotechnical data is not available for the site but it is assumed that the facility will require permafrost protection to ensure year round operations the proposed airstrip will operate as a private aerodrome and prior permission will be required for all aircraft utilizing the site the gravel airstrip will be approximately  meters long and capable of landing a dash  – qhercules c   the arctic project will require power of  mw of peak load for  td operation demand it is proposed that power will be generated by five selfcontained  mw prime diesel generators four units will be in service with the fifth unit reserved for maintenance heat will be recovered from the generators and used to heat the mill camp and related facilities   arctic project  history   during the ’s and ’s bear creek mining corporation “bcmc” an exploration subsidiary of kennecott conducted regional reconnaissance exploration in the cosmos hills and the southern brooks range stream silt sampling in  by bcmc revealed a significant copper anomaly in arctic creek roughly  km northeast of the previously identified bornite deposit the area was subsequently staked and in  eight core holes were drilled at the arctic deposit yielding impressive massive sulphide intercepts over an almost m strike length bcmc conducted intensive exploration on the property until  and then intermittently through  no drilling or additional exploration was conducted on the arctic project between  and         arctic project  historical metallurgical testwork   metallurgical studies during the kennecott era included two initial mineralogical studies undertaken by the kennecott research center “krc” to evaluate and identify the potential beneficiation or metallurgical treatment of concentrates of the samples from the deposit and a subsequent  lakefield research ltd lakefield metallurgical test program to confirm and improve upon the results from the s krc test work program in  trilogy contracted sgs to conduct an extensive metallurgical program in support of the artic pea the results of which are described and summarized below under the heading “ arctic project – metallurgical testing ”   arctic project  historical geophysics   prior to  kennecott conducted a series of geophysical surveys which are poorly documented or are unavailable to trilogy in march  kennecott initiated an extensive helicoptersupported airborne electromagnetic “em” and magnetic survey covering the entire vms belt including the arctic deposit kennecott identified eight em anomalies which were deemed to have significant potential for mineralization and followedup with additional gravity lines andor controlled source audiofrequency magnetotelluric “csamt” lines during  kennecott conducted no further geophysical field exploration in the district after    arctic project  historical drilling   between  and july  kennecott bcmc completed  holes including  large diameter metallurgical test holes totalling  m in  kennecott drilled an additional  core holes totalling  m to test for  extensions of the known arctic resource  grade and thickness continuity at arctic and  a nearby airborne geophysical anomaly drilling for all bcmckennecott campaigns in the arctic deposit area  to  totals  core holes for a combined  m   no drilling was performed on the project between  and  novagold took control of the project in    arctic project  historical geochemistry   historic geochemistry for the district compiled in the  kennecott database includes  soil samples  stream silt samples  rock samples and  panned concentrate samples data has been sourced from several companies including kennecott sunshine mining resource associates of alaska and nana sourcing of much of the data had been poorly documented in the database during  kennecott renewed its effort in the district and as a followup to the  em survey undertook directed soil and rock chip sampling in and around em anomalies generated in the geophysical targeting effort during this period kennecott collected  soils and  rocks and for the first time used extensive multielement inductively coupled plasma “icp” analysis   arctic project  geologic setting   regional geology   the ambler mining district occurs along the southern margin of brooks range within an eastwest trending zone of devonian to jurassic age submarine volcanic and sedimentary rocks the district covers both  vmslike deposits and prospects hosted in the devonian age ambler sequence or ambler schist belt a group of metamorphosed bimodal volcanic rocks with interbedded tuffaceous graphitic and calcareous volcaniclastic metasediments and  epigenetic carbonatehosted copper deposits occurring in devonian age carbonate and phyllitic rocks of the bornite carbonate sequence the ambler sequence occurs in the upper part of the anirak schist the thickest member of the schist belt or coldfoot subterrane vmslike stratabound mineralization can be found along the entire  km strike length of the district immediately south of the schist belt in the cosmos hills a time equivalent section of the anirak schist includes the approximately  km thick bornite carbonate sequence mineralization of both the vmslike deposits of the schist belt and the carbonatehosted deposits of the cosmos hills has been dated at  to  ma   in addition the ambler mining district is characterized by increasing metamorphic grade north perpendicular to the strike of the eastwest trending units the district shows isoclinal folding in the northern portion and thrust faulting to south schmidt  the devonian to mississippian age angayucham basalt and the triassic to jurassic age mafic volcanic rocks are in lowangle over thrust contact with various units of the ambler schist belt and bornite carbonate sequence along the northern edge of the ambler lowlands        localproperty geology   rocks that form the ambler sequence consist of a lithologically diverse sequence of lower paleozoic devonian age carbonate and siliciclastic strata with interlayered mafic lava flows and sills and felsic tuffs the clastic strata derived from terrigenous continental and volcanic sources were deposited primarily by massgravity flow into the subwavebase environment of an extending marginal basin   though the ambler sequence is exposed over  km of strike length descriptions and comments herein will refer to an area between the kogoluktuk river on the east and the shungnak river on the west where we have focused the majority of our exploration efforts over the last decade   the local base of the ambler sequence consists of variably metamorphosed carbonates historically referred to as the gnurgle gneiss we interpret these strata as calcturbidites perhaps deposited in a subwavebase environment adjacent to a carbonate bank calcareous schists overlie the gnurgle gneiss and host sporadically distributed mafic sills and pillowed lavas these finegrained clastic strata indicate a progressively quieter depositional environment up section and the presence of pillowed lavas indicates a rifting basinal environment   overlying these basal carbonates and pillowed basalts is a section of predominantly finegrained carbonaceous siliciclastic rocks which host a significant portion of the mineralization in the district including the arctic deposit this quiescent section indicates further isolation from a terrigenous source terrain   the section above the arctic deposit host stratigraphy contains voluminous reworked silicic volcanic strata with the button schist at its base the button schist is a regionally continuous and distinctive albite porphyroblastic unit that serves as an excellent marker above the main mineralized stratigraphy the paucity of volcanically derived strata below the arctic deposit host section and abundance above indicates that the basin and surrounding hinterlands underwent major tectonic reorganization during deposition of the arctic deposit section greywacke sands that we interpret as channeled highenergy turbidites occur throughout the section but concentrate high in the local stratigraphy   several rock units show substantial change in thickness and distribution in the vicinity of the arctic deposit that may have resulted from the basin architecture existing at the time of deposition between the arctic ridge geographically above the arctic deposit and the riley ridge to the west several significant differences have been documented including  the gnurgle gneiss which is thickest in exposures along the northern extension of arctic ridge and appears to thin to the west  mafic lavas and sills which thicken from east to west they show thick occurrences in upper subarctic creek and to the west but are sparsely distributed to the east  the quartzite section which within and above the arctic sulphide horizon does not occur in abundance east of arctic ridge it is thicker and occurs voluminously to the west  the button schist which thickens dramatically to the west from exposures on arctic ridge exposures to the east are virtually nonexistent and  greywacke sands which do not exist east of subarctic creek but occur in abundance as massive channeled accumulations to the west centered on riley ridge   these data are interpreted by us to define a generally northnorthwesttrending depocentre through the central ambler mining district diamictite occurrences described below in concert with these formational changes suggest that the depocentre had a faultcontrolled eastern margin with the basin deepening to the west this original basin architecture appears to have controlled mineralization of the sulphide systems at ambler and shungnak dead creek concentrating fluid flow along structures on the eastern basin margin   in addition to the underlying predeformational structural framework of the district suggested by the stratigraphic thickening of various facies around the arctic deposit the ambler sequence is deformed by two penetrative deformational events that significantly complicate the distribution and spatial arrangement of the local stratigraphy as described below   f deformation the earliest penetrative deformation event is associated with greenschist metamorphism and the development of regional schistosity true isoclinal folds are developed and fold noses typically are thickened the most notable f fold is the arctic antiform that defines the upper and lower limbs of the arctic deposit the fold closes along a northnortheast trending fold axis roughly mimicking the trace of subarctic creek and opening to the east importantly the overturned lower limb implies that the permissive stratigraphy should be repeated on a lower synformal isocline beneath the currently explored limbs and would connect with the permissive mineralized stratigraphy to the northwest at shungnak dead creek        f deformation the earlier f schistosity is in turn deformed by the f deformational event that resulted in the local development of an axial planar cleavage the deformational event is well defined throughout the schist belt and results in a series of south verging open to moderately overturned folds that define a series of eastwest trending folds of similar vergence across the entire schist belt stratigraphies this event is likely temporarily related to the emplacement of the devonian angayucham volcanics the obducted jurassic ophiolites and cretaceous sediments over the schist belt stratigraphies in addition to the earlier penetrative deformation events a series of poorly defined nonpenetrative deformation events likely as a consequence of cretaceous extension are seen as a series of warps or arches across the district the interplay between the complex local stratigraphy the isoclinal f event the overturned south verging f event and the series of postpenetrative deformational events makes district geological interpretation often extremely difficult at a local scale   recent work by us defines the arctic deposit as two or more discrete horizons of sulphide mineralization contained in a complexly deformed isoclinal fold with an upright upper limb and an overturned lower limb hosting the main mineral resources nearby drilling suggests a third limb an upright lower limb likely occurs beneath the currently explored stratigraphy    mineralization occurs as stratiform semimassive sulphide “sms” to massive sulphide “ms” beds within primarily graphitic chlorite schists and finegrained quartz sandstones the sulphide beds average four meters in thickness but vary from less than one meter up to as much as eighteen meters in thickness the bulk of the mineralization is within six modelled zones lying along the upper and lower limbs of the arctic isoclinal anticline all of the zones are within an area of roughly  km  with mineralization extending to a depth of approximately  m below the surface mineralization characteristically varies from ms to sms unlike more typical vms deposits mineralization is not characterized by steep metal zonation or massive pyritic zones mineralization is dominantly sheetlike zones of base metal sulphides with variable pyrite and only minor zonation usually on an extremely small scale no stockworks or stringer zones in association with the mineralization have been observed more importantly the mineralization in general exhibits characteristics and textures common to replacementstyle mineralization mineralization is predominately coarsegrained sulphides consisting mainly of chalcopyrite sphalerite galena tetrahedrite arsenopyrite pyrite and pyrrhotite trace amounts of electrum and enargite are also present gangue minerals associated with the mineralized horizons include quartz barite white mica black chlorite talc calcite dolomite and cymrite   talc and magnesium chlorite are the dominant alteration products associated with the sulphidebearing horizons talc alteration grades downward and outward to mixed talcmagnesium chlorite with minor phlogopite into zones of dominantly magnesium chlorite then into mixed magnesium chloritephengite with outer phengitealbite zones of alteration thickness of alteration zones vary with stratigraphic interpretation but tens of meters for the outer zones is likely as seen in phengitealbite exposures on the east side of arctic ridge stratigraphically above the sulphidebearing horizons significant muscovite as paragonite is developed and results in a marked shift in sodiummagnesium ratios across the sulphide bearing horizons of particular note are the barium “ba” species including barite cymrite a highpressure ba phyllosilicate and babearing muscovite phlogopite and biotite these species associated with both alteration and mineralization has also been strongly remobilized during metamorphism   historic interpretation of the genesis of the ambler schist belt deposits have called for a syngenetic vms origin with steep thermal gradients in and around seafloor hydrothermal vents resulting in metal deposition due to the rapid cooling of chloride bound base metals a variety of vms types have been well documented in the literature franklin et al  with the ambler schist belt deposits most similar to deposits associated with a bimodal mafic dominant volcanism related to incipient rifting the majority of field observations broadly support such a scenario at the arctic deposit and include  the tectonic setting with devonian volcanism in an evolving continental rift  the geologic setting with bimodal volcanics including pillow basalts and limited felsic volcanic tuffs  an alteration assemblage with welldefined magnesiumrich footwall alteration and sodiumrich hanging wall alteration and  typical polymetallic basemetal mineralization with massive and semimassive sulphides although the majority of field observations support a vms genesis to the deposits of the schist belt a series of other observations and characteristics suggest a more direct genetic link with that of the carbonatehosted bornite deposit in the devonian bornite carbonate sequence both deposit types have been dated at  to  ma suggesting a clear temporal link   the principal lithologic units captured in logging and mapping by us in broad chronological order from oldest to youngest are as follows greenstone chlorite schist talc schist grey to black schists metarhyolites most notably the socalled button schist which serves as an important stratigraphic marker quartz muscovite schists diamictites and greywackes        arctic project  exploration   novagold began exploration of the arctic deposit and surrounding lands of the schist belt in  after optioning the

by kennecott and trilogynovagold at the arctic deposit during kennecott’s tenure on the property sprague and henwood a pennsylvaniabased drilling company was the principal contractor sprague and henwood utilized company manufactured drill rigs during their tenure on the property many of their rigs remain at the bornite deposit and constitute a historical inventory of s and s exploration artifacts tonto drilling provided services to kennecott during kennecott’s short return to the district in the late s we and novagold have utilized boart longyear as our only contractor the  to  trilogynovagold drill programs used a single skidmounted lf core rig drilling hq or nq core wireframes were updated in  to incorporate interpretation of all drill results to date and have been included in the resource estimate   arctic project  sampling methodology and analysis   the data for the arctic deposit resource was generated over three primary drilling campaigns  to  when bcmc a subsidiary of kennecott copper corporation was the primary operator  when kennecott minerals resumed work after a long hiatus and  to  with novagold and now us as the operators   sampling of drill core prior to  by bcmc focused primarily on the mineralized zones numerous intervals of weak to moderate mineralization were not sampled during this period during the  campaign kennecott did sample some broad zones of alteration and weak mineralization but much of the unaltered and unmineralized drill core was left unsampled little documentation on historic sampling procedures is available   between  and  novagold conducted a systematic drill core relogging and resampling campaign of kennecott and bcmc era drill holes ar to ar novagold either took  to  m samples every  m or sampled entire lengths of previously unsampled core within a minimum of  m and a maximum of  m intervals the objective of the sampling was to generate a full icp geochemistry dataset for the arctic deposit and ensure continuous sampling throughout the deposit sample preparation procedures for novagold era work are described below        all drill core was transported by helicopter in secure core “baskets” to either the dahl creek camp or the bornite camp for logging and sampling sample intervals were determined by the geologist during the geological logging process sample intervals were labelled with white paper tags and butter aluminum tags which were stapled to the core box each tag had a unique number which corresponded to that sample interval sample intervals were determined by the geological relationships observed in the core and limited to a three meter maximum length and one meter minimum length an attempt was made to terminate sample intervals at lithological and mineralization boundaries sampling was generally continuous from the top to the bottom of the drill hole when the hole was in unmineralized rock the sample length was generally three meters whereas in mineralized units the sample length was shortened to one to two meters geological and geotechnical parameters were recorded based on defined sample intervals andor drill run intervals defined by the placement of a wooden block at the end of a core run logged parameters were reviewed annually and slight modifications have been made between campaigns but generally include rock type mineral abundance major structures specific gravity “sg” point load testing recovery and rock quality designation measurements drill logs were converted to a digital format and forwarded to the database manager who imported them into the master database core was photographed and then brought into the saw shack where it was split in half by the rock saw divided into sample intervals and bagged by the core cutters not all drill core was oriented however core that had been oriented was identified to samplers by a line drawn down the core stick if core was not competent it was split by using a spoon to transfer half of the core into the sample bag once the core was sawed half was sent to als chemex laboratories “als chemex” in vancouver for analysis and the other half was stored at the dahl creek camp but since has been consolidated at the storage facility at the bornite camp facilities or at our warehouse in fairbanks shipment of core samples from the dahl creek camp occurred on a drill hole by drill hole basis rice bags containing two to four polybagged core samples each were marked and labelled with the als chemex address project and hole number bag number and sample numbers enclosed rice bags were secured with a prenumbered plastic security tie and a twist wire tie and then assembled into sling loads for transport by chartered flights on a commercial airline to fairbanks where they were met by a contracted expeditor for delivery directly to the als minerals preparation facility in fairbanks in addition to the core control samples were inserted into the shipments at the approximate rate of one standard one blank and one duplicate per  core samples   · standards four standards were used at the arctic deposit the core cutter inserted a sachet of the appropriate standard as well as the sample tag into the sample bag · blanks were composed of an unmineralized landscape aggregate the core cutter inserted about  g of blank as well as the sample tag into the sample bag · duplicates the assay laboratory split the sample and ran both splits the core cutter inserted a sample tag into an empty sample bag   samples were logged into a tracking system on arrival at als chemex and weighed samples were then crushed dried and a  g split pulverized to greater than  passing  μm   gold assays were determined using fire analysis followed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy finish the lower detection limit was  ppm gold the upper limit was  ppm gold an additional element suite was assayed by inductively coupled plasmaatomic emission spectroscopy “icpaes” methodology following nitric acid aqua regia digestion the copper analyses were completed by atomic absorption “aa” following a triple acid digest   the accreditations of primary and secondary assay laboratories used during the  –  campaigns are not known als analytical lab fairbanks alaska was the primary assay lab between  – present als chemex has attained international organization for standardization “iso”  registration in addition the als chemex laboratory in vancouver is accredited to iso  by standards council of canada for a number of specific test procedures including fire assay of gold by aa icp and gravimetric finish multielement icp and aa assays for silver copper lead and zinc trilogy has no relationship with any assay labs   during  we conducted a  audit of the novagold era assay database fields sample interval au ag cu zn and pb this audit is documented in a series of memos our staff did not identify andor correct any transcription andor coding errors in the database prior to resource estimation we also retained independent consultant caroline vallat pgeo of geospark consulting inc to  reload  of the historical assay certificates  conduct a qaqc review of paired historical assays and novagold era reassays  monitor an independent check assay program for the  to  and  drill campaigns and  generate qaqc reports for the  to  and  drill campaigns        arctic – security of samples   security measures taken during historical kennecott and bcmc programs are unknown to novagold or us we are not aware of any reason to suspect that any of these samples have been tampered with the  to  samples were either in the custody of novagold personnel contractors or the assay laboratories at all times as discussed above and the chain of custody of the samples is well documented   arctic project  mineral resource estimate   the mineral resource estimate was prepared by tetra tech with an effective date of the resource estimate as of july   mineral resources are classified in accordance with the  cim definition standards for mineral resources and mineral reserves   the mineral resource model prepared by tetra tech considers diamond drill holes drilled by different operators during the period  to  the majority of the assaying has been completed in recent years by us and our previous parent company novagold the mineral resource for the arctic project is supported by  core holes

arctic project – mining operations   the arctic project is not currently in production for contemplated exploration or development activities see below   arctic project – exploration and development   as noted in the summary arctic project – technical report above we engaged tetra tech to prepare a pea for the arctic project the following summary describes the main results and assumptions of the pea not previously discussed above see “ arctic project – current activities ” below for a description of the company’s current and contemplated exploration   the pea is based on a conventional truckandshovel openpit mine design at a single pit the mining schedule was developed based on a maximum mill capacity of  td the arctic project’s total mine life is  years including  year of prestripping followed by  years of production the pit uses four pushbacks and a minimum mining width of  m over the year life the pit is producing  mt of mineralized material and  mt of waste rock the lifeofmine “lom” stripping ratio is  and the stripping ratio excluding the prestripping waste rock is  the mining schedule does not currently consider a lowgrade stockpiling option but this can be assessed in more detail in future studies        mineral processing and metallurgical testing   since  metallurgical test work has been conducted to determine the flotation response of various samples extracted from the arctic deposit in general the samples tested produced similar metallurgical performances in  sgs mineral services “sgs” conducted a metallurgical test program to further study metallurgical responses of the samples produced from zones    and  of the arctic deposit the flotation test procedures used talc preflotation conventional copperlead bulk flotation and zinc flotation followed by copper and lead separation in general the  test results indicated that the samples responded well to the flowsheet tested below is a summary of average results of the locked cycle tests without copper and lead separation   · the copper recoveries to the bulk copperlead concentrates ranged from  to  excluding the zone    composite which produced a copper recovery of approximately  the copper grades of the bulk concentrates were  to    · approximately  to  of the lead was recovered to the bulk copperlead concentrates containing  to  lead   · the zinc recovery was  from composite zone     from composite zone  and  from composite zone  on average the zinc grades of the concentrates produced were higher than  excluding the concentrate generated from composite zone    which contained only  zinc   · gold and silver were predominantly recovered into the bulk copperlead concentrates gold recoveries to this concentrate ranged from  to  and silver recoveries ranged from  to    using an open circuit procedure the copper and lead separation tests on the bulk copperlead concentrate produced from the locked cycle tests generated reasonable copper and lead separation the copper concentrates produced contained approximately  to  copper while the grades of the lead concentrates were in the range of  to  lead also it appears that most of the gold reported to the copper concentrate and on average the silver was equally recovered into the copper and lead concentrates   the  grindability test results showed that the bond ball millwork index tests ranged from  to  kwht and abrasion index tests fluctuated from  to  g for the mineralized samples the data indicates that the samples are neither resistant nor abrasive to ball mill grinding the materials are considered to be soft or very soft in terms of grinding requirements   recovery methods   a  td process plant has been designed to process the massive and semimassive sulphide mineralization of the arctic property the main economic elements found in the deposit are copper zinc lead and associated gold and silver the process plant will operate two twelve hour shifts per day  days per year with an overall plant availability of  the process plant will produce three concentrates  copper concentrate  zinc concentrate and  lead concentrate gold and silver are expected to be payable at a smelter and are recovered in both the copper and lead concentrates the process plant feed will be supplied from the arctic open pit mine   the mill feed will be hauled from the open pit to a primary crushing facility where the material will be crushed by a jaw crusher to a particle size of  passing  mm   the crushed material will be ground by two stages of grinding consisting of one sag mill and one ball mill in closed circuit with hydrocyclones sab circuit the hydrocyclone overflow with a grind size of approximately  passing  µm will first undergo pretalc flotation and then be processed by conventional bulk flotation to recover copper lead and associated gold and silver followed by zinc flotation the rougher bulk concentrate will be cleaned and followed by copper and lead separation to produce a lead concentrate and a copper concentrate the final tailings from the zinc flotation circuit will be pumped to the tsf copper lead and zinc concentrates will be thickened and pressurefiltered before being transported by truck to a port and shipped to smelters   the lom average mill feed is expected to contain  copper  lead  zinc  gt gold and  gt silver according to the mine plan developed for the pea study and metallurgical test results the lom average metal recoveries and concentrate grades are projected below   · copper concentrate recovery  copper  gold  silver copper grade         · lead concentrate recovery  lead  gold  silver lead grade    · zinc concentrate recovery  zinc zinc grade    tailings and storage facility   the codisposal tsf will be a fully lined facility consisting of rockfill embankment constructed across the subarctic creek drainage creating an impoundment that will extend up the drainage the rockfill embankment will be constructed to an ultimate crest elevation of  masl with the embankment being raised in stages to minimize the initial capital construction cost during operations potential acid generating “pag” waste rock will be placed at the bottom and sides of the basin forming layers with consecutive disposal on tailings that will be filling the voids the tailings has the potential to generate acid and therefore the tailings and the pag waste rock will be placed under water and remain permanently submerged in order to reduce the potential for acid generation additional studies will be required to determine the most suitable method of codisposal and potential requirements for acid rock drainage “ard” management and mitigation programs will need to be part of the design of the tsf   the tsf will be required to contain  mm  total over the year lom with  mm  to accommodate the tailings at an assumed stored dry density of  tm  and  mm  of pag waste rock at an assumed stored dry density of  tm   the tsf will be sited as a staged rockfill embankment with an upstream geomembrane liner the starter embankment will have a crest elevation of  m and impound  year of mining production which is approximately  m  of tailings and  mm  of waste rock   arctic project  environmental considerations   environmental baseline data collection was initiated in  including surface water quality sampling wetlands mapping stream flow monitoring aquatic life surveys subsistence meteorological monitoring and acid base accounting sampling additional baseline environmental data in the ambler lowlands the subarctic creek drainage the shungnak river drainage and downstream receiving environments will be required to support future mine design development of an environmental impact statement permitting construction and operations   the arctic project has the potential to significantly improve work opportunities for local and regional residents in october  we signed an agreement with nana which in addition to consolidating landholdings in the ambler district has language establishing native hiring preferences and preferential use of nana subsidiaries for contract work furthermore the agreement formalized an oversight committee with equal representation from nana and us to regularly review project plans and activities in addition a subsistence subcommittee has been formed to protect subsistence and the iñupiaq way of life and a workforce development subcommittee is also in place to address current and future employment needs we meet monthly during summer months with the residents of kobuk shungnak and ambler the three villages closest to the project area we also meet annually with eight other nana region villages including noatak kivalina kotzebue kiana deering buckland selawik and noorvik for the purpose of updating residents on project plans and fielding their questions and concerns we have also developed a good working relationship with the nwab government   the arctic project will be subject to a mine permitting process which will include compliance with the national environmental policy act and will require a number of major mine permits from state and federal agencies as well as a significant number of minor permits although a number of federal conservation units are located in the general vicinity of the arctic project including but not limited to the gates of the arctic national parks kobuk preserve selawik national wildlife refuge and kobuk valley and selawik wilderness areas there presence does not change the permitting process nor add to the number of permits required for the arctic project   we will be required to develop a formal project description and detailed reclamation and closure plan to support a successful permit application strategy the mine plan will embrace the concept of “design for closure” in order to reduce any lasting risk of environmental impacts the plan will minimize surface disturbances during operations and promote longterm stability of the site after closure   no assurance can be given that new laws and regulations will not be enacted or that existing laws and regulations will not be applied in a manner that could limit or curtail the arctic project amendments to current laws regulations licenses and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation thereof could have a material adverse impact on the arctic project and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production or abandonment or delays in the development of the business        arctic project  current activities      the focus of work on the arctic project in  was drilling surficial field investigations and desktop studies to support prefeasibility trilogy completed fourteen diamond drill holes for a total of  m of core including twelve infill drill holes representing  m designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the highgrade polymetallic copper gold silver lead and zinc mineralization and support upgrading of inferred resources to measured and indicated resource classification within the area of the proposed arctic openpit as outlined in the pea and two drill holes representing  m specifically targeting geotechnical and hydrogeological information based on a cutoff grade of  copper all fourteen drill holes intersected significant intervals defined as a minimum of  meter copper interval with average grade  copper   the  drill program sampling protocol and data verification were managed and overseen by qualified persons employed by trilogy the twelve infill diamond drill holes were drilled at nq diameter drill core and the two geotechnical drill holes were drilled at hq diameter drill core by boart longyear of south jordan utah samples in mineralized core were collected using a meter minimum length meter maximum length and meter average sample length samples in unmineralized core were collected using meter minimum length meter maximum length and meter average sample length drill core recovery averaged  without overburden three quality control samples one blank one standard and one duplicate were inserted into each batch of  samples the drill core was either sawn or shipped as whole core with samples sent to als minerals fairbanks alaska for sample preparation and the sample pulps forwarded to als’s north vancouver facility for analysis als minerals in north vancouver bc canada is a facility certified as iso  and accredited to iso  iec  from the standards council of canada   in addition to the drill program trilogy contracted srk consulting of vancouver canada srk to conduct a dedicated field investigation comprised of drill logging mapping laboratory test work and downhole installations a summary report detailing a gap analysis desktop study findings and field investigation recommendations was issued prior to the drill program two dual purpose drill holes were completed for geotechnical soil and rock and hydrogeological data acquisition additionally srk hydrogeologists revisited previously installed vibrating wire piezometers to ensure data loggers were operational and to download pore pressure measurement data a civil geotechnical site visit was conducted to investigate surface conditions and provide comment on potential infrastructure and waste management facilities layout furthermore structural mapping of exposed rock faces along the arctic ridge along with downhole televiewer and structural logging of newly acquired drill core were consolidated with prior work to support a d structural model   under the guidance of srk trilogy initiated acidbaseaccounting kinetic test work at arctic in  both onsite barrel testing and parallel laboratory humidity cells in addition trilogy collected samples from the  drill program to increase static testing coverage over the arctic deposit   environmental baseline data collection continued in  including  acres of wetlands delineation within the project area which was completed by whpacific of anchorage alaska seventy percent of a lidar survey over the ukmp was completed by whpacific and quantum spatial before weather conditions became unfavorable      site investigation activities continued at the ukmp projects in  and were mainly focused on advancing the arctic project towards prefeasibility we completed thirteen diamond drill holes for a total of  meters of core the  drill program was designed to collect data for geotechnical hydrological waste rock characterization and metallurgical studies as well as further resource definition   three drill holes representing  meters drilled were designed to collect geotechnical and hydrological data within the proposed arctic openpit data collected from the geotechnicalhydrological drill program and outcropseeps mapping was used to update a d structure model rock mass model and hydrogeology model and these results have been integrated into a combined geotechnical model that will be used for characterization of geotechnical domains and slope stability evaluation in a future prefeasibility study        four drill holes representing  meters drilled were designed to collect metallurgical samples specifically targeting material within the initial production years of the arctic openpit a metallurgical test work program is currently underway and expected to be complete in q   six drill holes representing  meters drilled were designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the high grade polymetallic copper gold silver lead and zinc mineralization and support upgrading of inferred resources to measured and indicated resource classification within the area of the proposed arctic openpit we are pleased to announce that all six infill holes encountered mineralized intervals consistent with previous drilling conducted within the resource area on the property data collected from the drill program was used to update the d geology model the updated geology domains and drill data will be incorporated into an updated resource estimate that will support a future prefeasibility study   the drill program sampling protocol and data verification were managed and overseen by qualified persons employed by trilogy metals thirteen diamond drill holes were drilled at hq and nq diameter drill core by boart

addition to the drill program we conducted an aquatics survey avian survey habitat survey archaeological survey and wetlands delineation survey and continued ongoing baseline environmental data collection in    an aquatics survey of rivers and creeks over the ukmp projects included identification of fish species present and tissues metals testing an avian survey over the ukmp projects was conducted in may to identify bird nest locations with a followup survey in july to measure fledging success a habitat survey was completed in conjunction with the wetlands survey and will be used to

to the western arctic herd that migrates twice a year – south in august from their summer range north of the brooks range and north in march from their winter range along the buckland river   bornite project  history   kennecott and bear creek mining tenure   regional exploration began in the early s when gold prospectors noted copper occurrences in the hills north of kobuk alaska in  local prospector rhinehart “rhiny” berg along with various partners traversing in the area located outcropping mineralization along ruby creek bornite on the north side of the cosmos hills they subsequently staked claims over the ruby creek showings and constructed an airstrip for access in  bcmc kennecotts exploration subsidiary optioned the property from berg exploration drilling in  and  culminated in the discovery of the “no ore body” where drill hole rc cut  m of  copper the “no ore body” is a historic term used by bcmc that does not connote economic viability in the present context it is convenient to continue to use the term to describe exploration work and historic resource estimation in a specific area of what is now generally known as ruby creek upper reef the discovery of the “no ore body” led to the development of an exploration shaft in  the shaft which reached a depth of  m encountered a significant watercourse and was flooded near completion depth the shaft was subsequently dewatered and an exploration drift was developed to provide access for sampling and mapping and to accommodate underground drilling to further delineate mineralization a total of  underground holes were drilled and after the program the shaft was allowed to reflood the discovery of the arctic project in  prompted a hiatus in exploration at bornite and only limited drilling occurred up until    in the late s kennecott resumed its evaluation of the bornite deposit and the mineralization in the cosmos hills with an intensive soil stream and rock chip geochemical sampling program using  element icp analyses grid soil sampling yielded  samples ridge and spur sampling resulted in an additional  soil samples in the following year skeletonized core samples  samples from key historic drill holes were also analyzed using  element icp analytical methods geochemical sampling identified multiple areas of elevated copper and zinc in the bornite region   kennecott completed numerous geophysical surveys as an integral part of exploration throughout their tenure on the property various reports notes figures and data files stored in kennecott’s salt lake city exploration office indicated that geophysical work included but was not limited to the following   · airborne magnetic and em surveys fixedwing input s   · gravity single point “sp” audiofrequency magnetotelluric “amt” em borehole and surface ipresistivity surveys s   · gravity airborne magnetic and csamt surveys s   we have little information or documentation associated with these geophysical surveys conducted prior to the s where data are available in these earlier surveys the lack of details in data acquisition coordinate systems and data reduction procedures limit their usefulness the only complete geophysical report available concerns downhole ipresistivity results most notable is the  bouger gravity survey from the bornite deposit into the ambler lowlands the bornite deposit itself is seen as a significant  milligal anomaly numerous  milligal to   milligal anomalies occur under cover in the ambler lowlands and near the aurora mountain and pardner hill occurrences in addition to the geophysical surveys conducted by kennecott the adnr completed an aeromagnetic survey of portions of the ambler mining district in         several studies have been undertaken reviewing the geology and geochemistry of the bornite deposit most notable is murray hitzman’s phd dissertation at stanford university and don runnel’s phd dissertation at harvard university bernstein and cox reported on mineralization of the “no  ore body” in a  paper in economic geology in addition to the historical work ty connor at the colorado school of mines recently completed a master’s thesis which reported on the timing of alteration and mineralization at the bornite deposit   kennecott conducted two technical reviews of the groundwater conditions and a summary of the findings related to the flooding of the exploration shaft in  kennecott collected  coarse reject samples from five drill holes to support preliminary metallurgical test work at bornite samples targeted highgrade   copper mineralization from the upper reef at ruby creek   bornite project  geological setting and mineralization   the bornite project is located within the arctic alaska terrane a sequence of mostly paleozoic continental margin rocks that make up the brooks range and north slope of alaska it is within the phyllite belt geologic subdivision which together with the highergrade schist belt stretches almost the entire length of the brooks range and is considered to represent the hinterland of the jurassic brooks range orogeny the southern margin of the phyllite belt is marked by mélange and low angle faults associated with the kobuk river fault zone while the northern boundary is thought to be gradational with the highergrade metamorphic rocks of the schist belt   the geology of the bornite resource area is composed of alternating beds of carbonate rocks limestone and dolostone and calcareous phyllite limestone transitions laterally into dolostone which hosts the majority of the mineralization and is considered to be hydrothermal in origin spatial relationships and petrographic work establish dolomitization as genetically related to early stages of the copper mineralizing system   work by trilogy in  focused on furthering the understanding of the distribution and nature of the various lithologic units and their context in a sedimentary depositional model the updated model based on lithogeochemical signatures of the various units along with their historical visual logging shows stacked debris flows composed of basal nonargillaceous channelized debris flows breccias with a fining upward sequence of increasingly argillaceousrich breccias capped by high calcium ca phyllites confined laterally in channels between either massive or thinbedded platform carbonates two stacked debris flow sequences are apparent the lower and upper reefs the upper reef grades vertically into capping argillaceous limestones instead of discrete high ca phyllites indicating a shallowing upward or filling of the debris flow channels based on this updated interpretation a series individual debris flow cycles have been modeled low calcium ca phyllites such as the anirak schist qp and the beaver creek phyllite respectively underlie and cap the local stratigraphy suggesting different sourcing than the locally derived high ca phyllites of the debris flow dominated bornite carbonate sequence stratigraphy the beaver creek is in structural contact with the bornite carbonate sequence while the contact with the underlying anirak schist is an unconformity in addition to the stacked sedimentary stratigraphy a crosscutting breccia dubbed the pbreccia has been identified in and around the recently discovered south reef mineralization though poorly defined by the overall lack of drilling in the area the body which contains excellent copper grade lies at or near the iron mountain discontinuity it remains unclear whether the p breccia is a postdepositional structural hydrothermal or solutioncollapse induced breccia   structural fabrics observed on the property include bedding and two separate foliations bedding s can be measured only rarely where phyllite and carbonate are interbedded and it is unclear to what extent it is transposed the pervasive foliation s is easily measured in phyllites and may be reflected by colour banding andor stylolamination flaggy habit in outcrop of the carbonates core logging shows that s is folded gently on the  m scale and locally tightly folded at the decimetre scale s axial planar cleavage is locally developed in decimetre scale folds of s both s and s foliations are considered to be jurassic in age owing to their greater strength bodies of secondary dolostone have resisted strain and foliation development whereas the surrounding limestone and calcphyllite appear in places to have been attenuated during deformation this deformation presumably jurassic complicates sedimentological interpretations potentially the earliest and most prominent structural feature in the resource area is the northeasttrending iron mountain discontinuity which is still problematic in its interpretation        mineralization at bornite occurs as tabular mineralized zones that coalesce into crudely stratiform bodies hosted in secondary dolomite two significant dolomitic horizons that host mineralization have been mapped by drilling and include  the lower reef a thick  to  m thick dolomitized zone lying immediately above the basal quartz phyllite unit of the anirak schist and  the upper reef a  to  m thick dolomite horizon roughly  m higher in section   the lower reef dolomite outcrops along the southern margin of the ruby creek zone and is spatially extensive throughout the deposit area it hosts a significant portion of the shallow resources in the ruby creek zone as well as higher grade resources down dip and to the northeast in the south reef the upper reef zone hosts relatively highgrade resources to the north in the ruby creek zone the upper reef zone appears to lie at an important ne trending facies transition to the nw of the main drilled area and locally appears to be at least partially thrust over the lower reef stratigraphy to the southeast   drill results from  show dolomitization and copper mineralization in the upper and lower reefs coalescing into a single horizon along the northern limits of current exploration the ne trending ruby creek and south reef zones also coalesce into a roughly  m wide zone of  m thick dolomite containing significant copper mineralization dipping north at roughly  degrees   bornite project – mineralization   copper mineralization at bornite is comprised of chalcopyrite bornite and chalcocite distributed in stacked roughly stratiform zones exploiting favourable stratigraphy within the dolomitized limestone package mineralization occurs in order of increasing grade as disseminations irregular and discontinuous stringerstyle veining breccia matrix replacement and stratiform massive sulphides the distribution of copper mineral species is zoned around the bottomcentre of each zone with bornitechalcocitechalcopyrite at the core and progressing outward to chalcopyritepyrite additional volumetrically minor copper species include carrollite digenite tennantitetetrahedrite and covellite stringer pyrite and locally significant sphalerite occur above and around the copper zones while locally massive pyrite and sparse pyrrhotite occur in association with siderite alteration below copper mineralization in the lower reef   in addition to the copper mineralization significant cobalt mineralization is found accompanying bornitechalcocite mineralization cobalt occurs with highgrade copper as both carrollite cocus and as cobaltiferous rims on recrystallized pyrite grains   appreciable silver values are also found with borniterich mineralization in the south reef and ruby creek zones   bornite project – exploration   exploration in and around the bornite project by kennecott from  to  is summarized above in addition to the extensive drilling completed during the more than  year tenure of kennecott in the district kennecott completed widespread surface geochemical sampling regional and property scale mapping and numerous geophysical surveys employing a wide variety of techniques the majority of this data has been acquired by us and forms the basis for renewed exploration that targets bornitestyle mineralization in the bornite carbonate sequence   novagold as the precursor company to us began to actively pursue an agreement to explore the bornite project with nana in  resulting in an initial airborne geophysical survey in  negotiations on the consolidation and exploration of the entire ambler district continued for the next several years culminating in the nana agreement in october    with the nana agreement approaching completion novagold initiated work in  to begin to characterize the exploration potential and depositional controls by relogging and reanalyzing select drill holes with a niton portable xray fluorescence “xrf” to determine geochemical variability in  novagold began an initial drill program to verify the historical database and exploration potential and conducted additional geophysical surveys to provide better targeting tools for continued exploration in the district in  we expanded the ip geophysical coverage completing a major districtwide survey that targeted the prospective bornite carbonate sequence subsequent resource drilling between  and  based on the exploration targeting is discussed in the “ bornite project  mineral resource estimates” section below          novagold exploration   in  novagold contracted fugro airborne surveys to complete a detailed helicopter dighem magnetic em and radiometric survey of the cosmos hills the survey covered a rectangular block approximately  km by  km which totaled  line kilometres the survey was flown at  m line spacing with a line direction of ne the dighem helicopter survey system produced detailed profile data of magnetics em responses and radiometrics total count uranium thorium and potassium and was processed into maps of magnetics discrete em anomalies em apparent resistivity and radiometric responses    novagold exploration   in  in anticipation of completing the nana agreement nana granted novagold permission to begin low level exploration at bornite this consisted of relogging and reanalyzing select drill holes using a niton portable xrf in addition to the  relogging effort novagold contracted a consulting geophysicist lou oconnor to compile a unified airborne magnetic map for the ambler mining district from kennecott alaska dnr and novagold airborne geophysical surveys    novagold exploration   in  novagold contracted zonge international inc “zonge” to conduct both dipoledipole complex resistivity induced polarization “crip” and natural source audiomagnetotelluric “nsamt” surveys over the northern end of the prospect to develop tools for additional exploration targeting under cover to the north   nsamt data were acquired along two lines totaling  linekm with one line oriented generally northsouth through the centre of the survey area and one being the southernmost eastwest line in the survey area crip data were acquired on five lines four eastwest lines and one northsouth line for a total coverage of  linekm and  collected crip stations the initial objective of the survey was to investigate geological structures and the distribution of sulphides possibly associated with copper mineralization   results from the paired surveys show that widespaced dipoledipole resistivity is the most effective technique to directly target the mineralization package broad low resistivity anomalies reflecting pyrite haloes and mineralization appear to define the limits of the fluid package welldefined and often very strong chargeability anomalies are also present but appear in part to be masked by phyllitic units which also have strong chargeability signatures the nsamt show similar resistivity features as the ip but are less well resolved    trilogy exploration   in light of the success of the  geophysical program we contracted zonge to conduct a major districtwide dipoledipole ip survey a downhole ip radial array survey in the south reef area and an extensive physical property characterization study of the various lithologies to better interpret the existing historical geophysical data   zonge completed  line km of  m dipoledipole ip during  infilling and expanding on the  survey and stretching across the most prospective part of the outcropping permissive bornite carbonate sequence the results show a welldefined low resistivity area associated with mineralization and variable ip signatures attributed both to mineralization and the overlying beaver creek phyllite numerous target areas occur in the immediate bornite area with lesser targets occurring in the aurora mountain and pardner hill areas and in the far east of the survey area during the  drill program at south reef a single drill hole was targeted on a low resistivity area approximately  m to  m southeast of the south reef mineralization trend although the drill hole intersected some dolomite alteration in the appropriate stratigraphy no significant sulphides were encountered   in addition to the extensive ground ip survey zonge also completed  km of downhole radial ip using an electrode placed in drill hole rc to further delineate the trend and potential in and around the south reef in addition to the  ground geophysical surveys extensive physical property data including resistivity chargeability specific gravity and magnetic susceptibility were captured for use in modelling the existing ground ip and gravity surveys and the airborne em and magnetic surveys   in addition to geophysical focused exploration a district wide geologic map was compiled integrating kennecott’s ’s mapping of the cosmos hills with selective trilogy mapping in          trilogy exploration   the emphasis of the  program was to further validate and refine the  geologic map of the cosmos hills a deep penetrating soil and vegetation geochemical orientation survey was completed over the south reef deposit utilizing various partial leaches and ph methods the initial approximately  km test lines suggest a good response for several of the partial leaches of the soils but little response in the vegetative samples further followup is warranted to the north of the deposit into the ambler lowlands    trilogy exploration   during  exploration work was limited to a relogging and resampling program of historical kennecott drill core    trilogy exploration   as a followup to the  field program a deep penetrating soil and vegetation geochemical survey was extended north of the deposit into the ambler lowlands trilogy geologists completed a lithogeochemical desktop study and a comprehensive update to the d lithology model the updated domains have been utilized in the most recent resource estimation   bornite project – drilling   a total of  surface core holes and  underground core holes totaling  m have been drilled targeting the bornite deposit during  different annual campaigns dating from  through  all of the drill campaigns with the exception of the  novagold campaign and the  and  trilogy campaigns were completed by kennecott or their exploration subsidiary bcmc all drill holes except rc and rc which have been reserved for metallurgical studies were utilized in the estimation of the current resource   sprague and henwood a pennsylvaniabased drilling company completed all of the kennecott drilling with the exception of the  program three drill holes completed by tonto drilling services inc a nanadynatech company the  thru  novagoldtrilogy programs used boart longyear company as the drill contractor   in the initial years of drilling at bornite kennecott relied on ax core  in or  mm diameter but as drilling migrated towards deeper targets a change to bx core  in or  mm diameter was implemented to help limit deviation from  to  drilling activity at bornite moved underground and ex diameter core  in or  mm diameter was implemented to define the ruby creek upper reef zone “no ore body” drilling activity moved back to the surface in  and from  to  bx core was most commonly drilled in later years core size increased to nx  in or  mm diameter and finally in  core size increased to nq  in or  mm diameter and hq  in or  mm diameter progressively larger diameter drill rods have been continually used over the years in an attempt to minimize drill hole deviations   there is only partial knowledge of specific drill core handling procedures used by kennecott during their tenure at the bornite deposit all of the drill data collected during the kennecott drilling programs  to  was logged on paper drill logs copies of which are stored in the kennecott office in salt lake city utah electronic scanned copies of the paper logs in pdf format are held by trilogy drill core was sawed or split with a splitter with half core submitted to various assay labs and the remainder stored in the kennecott core storage facility at the bornite deposit in  kennecott entered the drill assay data the geologic core logs and the down hole collar survey data into an electronic format in  novagold geologists verified the geologic data from the original paper logs against the kennecott electronic format and then merged the data into a microsoft™ sql database sampling of drill core by kennecott and bcmc focused primarily on the moderate to high grade mineralized zones intervals of visible sulphide mineralization containing roughly  to  copper were selected for analysis by union assay office inc of salt lake city utah this approach left numerous intervals containing weak to moderate copper mineralization unsampled in the historic drill core during the  exploration program we began sampling a portion of this remaining drill core in select holes in the south reef area trilogy extended this sampling program to the ruby creek area in  and         throughout our tenure at bornite the following core handling procedures have been implemented core is slung by helicopter or transported by truck or atv from the drill rig to the corelogging facility upon delivery geologists and geotechnicians open and inspect the core boxes for any irregularities they first mark the location of each drilling block on the core box and then convert footages on the blocks into metric equivalents geotechnicians or geologists measure the intervals or “fromto” for each box of core and include this information together with the drill hole id and box number on a metal tag stapled to the end of each box geotechnicians then measure the core to calculate percent recovery and rock quality designation “rqd” rqd is the sum of the total length of all pieces of core over  cm in a run the total length of core in each run is measured and compared to the corresponding run length to determine percent recovery core is then logged with lithology and visual alteration features captured on observed interval breaks mineralization data including total sulphide recorded as percent sulphide type recorded as a relative amount and gangue and vein mineralogy are collected for each sample interval with an average interval of approximately  m structural data is collected as point data geologists then mark sample intervals to capture each lithology or other geologically appropriate intervals sample intervals of core are typically between  m and  m in length but are not to exceed  m in length occasionally if warranted by the need for better resolution of geology or mineralization smaller sample intervals have been employed geologists staple sample tags on the core boxes at the start of each sample interval and mark the core itself with a wax pencil to designate sample intervals this sampling approach is considered sound and appropriate for this style of mineralization and alteration drill core is digitally photographed prior to sampling drill core is cut in half using diamond core saws specific attention to core orientation is maintained during core sawing to ensure that representative samples are obtained onehalf of the core is retained in the core box for storage on site or at our fairbanks warehouse and the other half bagged and labeled for analysis samples are selected for specific gravity measurements   in   historic drill holes in the ruby creek area and in   historic drill holes in the ruby creek area were relogged resampled and reassayed as these holes had previously only been selectively sampled by kennecott entire holes were relogged utilizing trilogy protocols discussed above samples were submitted either as halfcore where previously sampled or whole core where unsampled this was done to ensure that a sufficient volume of material was provided for analysis sample intervals were matched to historic intervals whenever possible or selected to reflect trilogy sampling procedures described above the objectives of the reassayrelogging program were threefold  to implement a qaqc program on intervals previously sampled by kennecott in order to confirm the validity of their results  to identify additional lowergrade  copper which was not previously sampled and  to provide additional multielement icp data to assist in the geologic interpretation of the deposit   bornite project  sample preparation analyses and security   sample preparation analytical lab accreditation and security measures taken during historical kennecott and bcmc programs are unknown to us however we are not aware of any reason to suspect that any of these samples have been tampered with the  to  samples were either in the custody of novagold or trilogy personnel or the assay laboratories at all times and the chain of custody of the samples is well documented   once drill core was sawed one half was retained for future reference and the other half was sent to als minerals formerly als chemex in vancouver for analyses shipment of core samples from the bornite camp occurred whenever backhaul capacity was available on the chartered aircraft which was generally  to  days a week rice bags containing two to four individual polybagged core samples were marked and labeled with the als minerals address project name bornite drill hole number bag number and sample numbers enclosed rice bags were secured with a prenumbered plastic security tie assembled into loads for transport by chartered flights on a commercial airline to fairbanks and directly delivered by a contracted expeditor to the als minerals preparation facility in fairbanks in addition to the core samples control samples were inserted into the shipments at the approximate rate of one standard one blank and one duplicate per  core samples samples were logged into a tracking system on arrival at als minerals and weighed samples were then crushed dried and a  g split was pulverized to greater than  passing  μm   gold assays in  and  were determined using fire analysis followed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy “aas” finish gold was not analyzed in  or  the lower detection limit was  ppm gold the upper limit was  ppm gold an additional element suite was assayed by inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry “icpms” and icpaes methodologies following a four acid digest over limit  copper and zinc analyses were completed by aa following a four acid digest   als minerals has attained international organization for standardization iso  registration in addition the als minerals laboratory in vancouver is accredited to iso  by standards council of canada for a number of specific test procedures including fire assay of gold by aa icp and gravimetric finish multielement icp and aa assays for silver copper lead and zinc trilogy has no relationship with any primary or check assay labs utilized        during   and  trilogy staff performed continuous validation of the drill data both while logging was in progress and after the field program was complete trilogy also retained independent consultant caroline vallat pgeo of geospark consulting inc to  import digital drill data to the master database and conduct qaqc checks upon import  conduct a qaqc review of paired historical assays and trilogy   and  reassays  monitor an independent check assay program for the   and  campaigns and  generate a qaqc report for the   and  campaigns   bornite project  mineral resource estimates   the mineral resource estimate has been prepared by bruce m davis fausimm bd resource consulting and robert sim pgeo sim geological inc both “independent qualified persons” as defined in ni  we have filed three previous ni  technical reports on the bornite project dated march   february   and july   the effective date of this resource is april     the bornite project database comprises a total of  diamond drill core holes totaling  m  holes target the ruby creek zone and  holes target the south reef zone the remaining  holes in the database are exploratory in nature and test for satellite mineralization proximal to the bornite deposit the database contains a total of  samples that have been analyzed for copper content during  trilogy geologists relogged and sampled  kennecott drill holes comprising approximately  meters with partial or no assays the new resource estimate incorporates the results from the  field program as well as advancements to the d geological model completed during    mineralization in the ruby creek zone occurs as two discrete strata bound lenses a lower reef which outcrops and dips approximately  degrees to the northeast and an upper reef lying roughly  meters above the lower reef stratigraphy and which includes a small highgrade zone historically referred to as the no orebody by kennecott mineralization is hosted by a devonian age carbonate sequence containing broad zones of dolomite alteration and associated sulfide mineralization including bornite chalcopyrite and chalcocite occurring as disseminations and vein stockworks as well as crackle and mosaic breccia fillings and locally massive to semimassive replacement bodies the geological and assay database have been reviewed and audited by bdrc and sgi it is of the opinion of bdrc and sgi that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence the boundaries for copper mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support mineral resource estimation that estimation utilizes twometer compositing of assays from  drill holes completed between  and  estimated blocks were  x  x  meters on a side   sixty domains were established for the estimation all of which were treated as hard boundaries with no mixing of data between the domains a series of carbonate and phyllite lithology domains together with grade probability shells at  copper and  copper thresholds were used to constrain the estimates visual inspections of the probability shells show that they fit well with observed levels of bornite chalcocite and chalcopyrite mineralization   based on the interpreted local highgrade nature of the mineralization both capping and outlier restriction strategies were implemented to control the influence of highgrade mineralization in the resource model this methodology removed approximately  of the contained copper in the ruby creek area and  of the contained copper in the south reef area   a total of  samples containing specific gravity measurements were utilized to estimate densities in the block model specific gravity values were estimated into model blocks using inverse distance squared moving averages using the domains described previously   copper grades in model blocks were estimated using ordinary kriging a dynamic search orientation strategy was utilized during both grade and specific gravity interpolations which is controlled by the interpreted trends of mineralization in the upper lower and south reef zones the block model has been validated through a combination of visual and statistical methods to ensure that the grade and density estimates are an appropriate representation of the underlying sample data        the bornite deposit comprises several zones of relatively continuous moderate to highgrade copper mineralization that extends from surface to depths of more than  m below surface the deposit is potentially amenable to a combination of open pit and underground extraction methods it is important to recognize that these discussions of underground and surface mining parameters are used solely for the purpose of testing the “reasonable prospects for economic extraction” and do not represent an attempt to estimate mineral reserves no mineral reserves have been calculated for the bornite project   indicated mineral resources includes blocks in the model that are potentially amenable to open pit extraction methods and are delineated by drilling with holes spaced at a maximum distance of  meters and exhibit a relatively high degree of confidence in the grade and continuity of mineralization resources in the inferred category require a minimum of one drill hole within a maximum distance of  m and exhibit reasonable confidence in the grade and continuity of mineralization   in the opinion of the qualified persons the level of understanding of the geologic controls that influence the distribution of copper mineralization at the bornite deposit is relatively good the drilling sampling and validation practices utilized by trilogy during the various campaigns have been conducted in a professional manner and adhere to accepted industry standards the confidence in older historic drilling conducted by kennecott has been demonstrated through a series of validation checks and overall the underlying database is considered sufficient for the estimation of indicated and inferred mineral resources the mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted cim estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves best practices guidelines and are reported in accordance with the canadian securities administrators’ ni  mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability there is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve the

standard grinding and flotation methods to produce copper concentrates initial testing indicates copper recoveries of approximately  resulting in concentrate grades of approximately  copper with very low potential penalty elements further metallurgical testwork is warranted to test these assumptions   bornite project – environmental considerations   the bornite project area includes nana’s bornite and ancsa lands the ruby creek drainage a tributary of the shungnak river the shungnak river drainage and portions of the ambler lowlands since  baseline environmental data collection has occurred in the area including archaeology aquatic life surveys sediment sampling wetlands mapping surface water quality sampling hydrology meteorological monitoring and subsistence additional baseline environmental data in nana’s bornite and ancsa lands the ruby creek drainage the shungnak river drainage portions of the ambler lowlands and downstream receiving environments will be required to support future mine design development of an eis permitting construction and operations        bornite project – mining operations   the bornite project is not currently in production for contemplated exploration or development activities see below   bornite project – exploration and development permitting   development of the bornite project will require a significant number of permits and authorizations from state federal and regional organizations much of the groundwork to support a successful permitting effort must be undertaken prior to submission of permit applications so that issues can be identified and resolved baseline data can be acquired and regulators and stakeholders can become familiar with the proposed project the comprehensive permitting process for the bornite project can be divided into three categories    exploration stateregional permitting required to obtain approval for drilling camp operations engineering and environmental baseline studies    preapplication phase conducted in conjunction with engineering feasibility studies this stage includes the collection of environmental baseline data and interaction with stakeholders and regulators to facilitate the development of a project that can be successfully permitted    the national environmental policy act phase formal agency review of the federal and state requirements for public and agency participation to determine if and how the bornite project can be done in an acceptable manner   the permit review process will determine the number of management plans required to address all aspects of the project to ensure compliance with environmental design and permit criteria each plan will describe the appropriate environmental engineering standard and the applicable operations requirements maintenance protocols and response actions   bornite project – current activities   following the release in the spring of  of the bornite report we focused field investigations and drilling activities on advancing our arctic project towards prefeasibility field work at the bornite project consisted of continued environmental baseline data collection and the completion of the lidar survey over the greater project area initiated in  we continue to evaluate geological and hydrogeological data to support internal desktop evaluations and planning of future field investigations

such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust   nonus holders   for purposes of this summary a “nonus holder” is a beneficial owner of common shares that is neither a us holder nor a us partnership or other “passthrough” entity this summary does not address the us federal income tax considerations applicable to nonus holders relating to the acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares accordingly nonus holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the us federal us state and local and foreign tax consequences

own tax advisors regarding the us federal income tax consequences relating to the acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares   tax consequences other than us federal income tax consequences not addressed   this summary does not address the us state and local us estate and gift us alternative minimum tax or foreign tax consequences to us holders relating to the acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares each us holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the us state and local us estate and gift us federal alternative minimum tax and foreign tax consequences relating to the acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares   us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares   distributions on common shares   subject to the pfic rules discussed below a us holder that receives a distribution including a constructive distribution with respect to a common share will be required to include the amount of such distribution in gross income as a dividend without reduction for any canadian income tax withheld from such distribution to the extent of the current or accumulated “earnings and profits” of the company as computed for us federal income tax purposes to the extent that a distribution exceeds the current and accumulated “earnings and profits” of the company such distribution will be treated first as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of a us holder’s tax basis in the common shares and thereafter as a gain from the sale or exchange of such common shares see “ sale or other taxable disposition of common shares ” below however the company does not intend to maintain the calculations of earnings and profits in accordance with us federal income tax principles and each us holder should therefore assume that any distribution by the company with respect to the common shares will constitute ordinary dividend income subject to applicable limitations dividends paid by the company to noncorporate us holders including individuals generally will be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to longterm capital gains for dividends provided certain holding period and other conditions are satisfied including that the company not be classified as a pfic as discussed below in the tax year of distribution or in the preceding tax year dividends received on common shares by corporate us holders will not be eligible for the “dividends received deduction” the dividend rules are complex and each us holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of such rules   sale or other taxable disposition of common shares   subject to the pfic rules discussed below upon the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares a us holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between a the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received and b its tax basis in such common shares sold or otherwise disposed of such gain generally will be treated as “us source” for purposes of applying the us foreign tax credit rules unless the gain is subject to tax in canada and is resourced as “foreign source” under the convention and such us holder elects to treat such gain or loss as “foreign source” see a more detailed discussion at “ foreign tax credit ” below any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss which will be longterm capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale or other disposition such common shares are held for more than one year preferential tax rates apply to longterm capital gains of a us holder that is an individual estate or trust there are currently no preferential tax rates for longterm capital gains of a us holder that is a corporation deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations under the code   foreign tax credit   a us holder who pays whether directly or through withholding canadian income tax with respect to dividends paid on the common shares generally may elect to deduct or credit such tax this election is made on a yearbyyear basis and applies to all foreign taxes paid whether directly or through withholding by a us holder during a year        complex limitations apply to the foreign tax credit including the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a us holder’s us federal income tax liability that such us holder’s “foreign source” taxable income bears to such us holder’s worldwide taxable income in applying this limitation a us holder’s various items of income and deduction must be classified under complex rules as either “foreign source” or “us source” in addition this limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific categories of income dividends paid by the company generally will constitute “foreign source” income and generally will be categorized as “passive category income” however and subject to certain exceptions a portion of the dividends paid by a foreign corporation will be treated as us source income for united states foreign tax credit purposes in proportion to its us source earnings and profits if united states persons own directly or indirectly  percent or more of the voting power or value of the foreign corporation’s shares a portion of any dividends paid with respect to the common shares may be treated as us source income under these rules which may limit the ability of a us holder to claim a foreign tax credit for any canadian withholding taxes payable in respect of such amount because the foreign tax credit rules are complex us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the foreign tax credit rules including the source of any dividends paid to us holders   subject to certain specific rules foreign income and withholding taxes paid with respect to any distribution in respect of stock in a pfic should qualify for the foreign tax credit the rules relating to distributions by a pfic are complex and a us holder should consult with its own tax advisor with respect to any distribution received from a pfic   receipt of foreign currency   the amount of any distribution paid in foreign currency to a us holder in connection with the ownership of common shares or on the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of common shares generally will be equal to the us dollar value of such foreign currency based on the exchange rate applicable on the date of actual or constructive receipt regardless of whether such foreign currency is converted into us dollars at that time if the foreign currency received is not converted into us dollars on the date of receipt a us holder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its us dollar value on the date of receipt a us holder that receives foreign currency and converts such foreign currency into us dollars at a conversion rate other than the rate in effect on the date of receipt may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss which generally would be treated as us source ordinary income or loss for foreign tax credit purposes different rules apply to us holders who use the accrual method of tax accounting us holders should consult their own us tax advisors regarding the us federal income tax consequences of receiving owning and disposing of foreign currency    additional tax on passive income   individuals estates and certain trusts whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a  medicare surtax on “net investment income” including among other things dividends and net gain from disposition of property other than property held in certain trades or businesses us holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect if any of this tax on their ownership and disposition of common shares   passive foreign investment company rules   if the company is considered a pfic within the meaning of section  of the code at any time during a us holder’s holding period then certain different and potentially adverse tax consequences would apply to such us holder’s acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares   pfic status of the company   the company generally will be a pfic if for a given tax year a  or more of the gross income of the company for such tax year is passive income or b  or more of the assets held by the company either produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income based on the fair market value of such assets “gross income” generally includes all revenues less the cost of goods sold plus income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources and “passive income” includes for example dividends interest certain rents and royalties certain gains from the sale of stock and securities and certain gains from commodities transactions active business gains arising from the sale of commodities generally are excluded from passive income if substantially all  or more of a foreign corporation’s commodities are stock in trade or inventory depreciable property used in a trade or business or supplies regularly used or consumed in a trade or business and certain other requirements are satisfied        for purposes of the pfic income test and asset test described above if the company owns directly or indirectly  or more of the total value of the outstanding shares of another corporation the company will be treated as if it a held a proportionate share of the assets of such other corporation and b received directly a proportionate share of the income of such other corporation in addition for purposes of the pfic income test and asset test described above “passive income” does not include any interest dividends rents or royalties that are received or accrued by the company from a “related person” as defined in section d of the code to the extent such items are properly allocable to the income of such related person that is not passive income   under certain attribution rules if the company is a pfic us holders will be deemed to own their proportionate share of any subsidiary of the company which is also a pfic a “subsidiary pfic” and will be subject to us federal income tax on a a distribution on the shares of a subsidiary pfic and b a disposition of shares of a subsidiary pfic both as if the us holder directly held the shares of such subsidiary pfic    the company believes that it was not a pfic for the tax years ended november    and  but may be a pfic in future tax years no opinion of legal counsel or ruling from the irs concerning the status of the company as a pfic has been obtained or is currently planned to be requested the determination of whether the company or a subsidiary of the company was or will be a pfic for a tax year depends in part on the application of complex us federal income tax rules which are subject to differing interpretations in addition whether the company or subsidiary will be a pfic for any tax year depends on the assets and income of the company and each such subsidiary over the course of each such tax year and as a result cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this document accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge any determination made by the company or subsidiary concerning its pfic status or that the company and any subsidiary was not or will not be a pfic for any tax year us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the pfic status of the company and any subsidiary of the company    default pfic rules under section  of the code   if the company is a pfic the us federal income tax consequences to a us holder of the acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares will depend on whether such us holder makes a qef election or makes a marktomarket election under section  of the code a “marktomarket election” with respect to common shares a us holder that does not make either a qef election or a marktomarket election will be referred to in this summary as a “nonelecting us holder”   a nonelecting us holder will be subject to the rules of section  of the code with respect to a any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares and b any excess distribution paid on the common shares a distribution generally will be an “excess distribution” to the extent that such distribution together with all other distributions received in the current tax year exceeds  of the average distributions received during the three preceding tax years or during a us holder’s holding period for the common shares if shorter   if the company is a pfic under section  of the code any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares including an indirect disposition of shares of a subsidiary pfic and any excess distribution paid on common shares or a distribution by a subsidiary pfic to its shareholder that is deemed to be received by a us holder must be ratably allocated to each day of a nonelecting us holder’s holding period for the common shares the amount of any such gain or excess distribution allocated to the tax year of disposition or excess distribution and to years before the company became a pfic if any would be taxed as ordinary income the amounts allocated to any other tax year would be subject to us federal income tax at the highest tax applicable to ordinary income in each such year and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax liability for each such year calculated as if such tax liability had been due in each such year a nonelecting us holder that is not a corporation must treat any such interest paid as “personal interest” which is not deductible   if the company is a pfic for any tax year during which a nonelecting us holder holds common shares the company will continue to be treated as a pfic with respect to such nonelecting us holder regardless of whether the company ceases to be a pfic in one or more subsequent years if the company ceases to be a pfic a nonelecting us holder may terminate this deemed pfic status with respect to common shares by electing to recognize gain which will be taxed under the rules of section  of the code discussed above as if such common shares were sold on the last day of the last tax year for which the company was a pfic        under proposed treasury regulations if a us holder has an option warrant or other right to acquire stock of a pfic such option warrant or right is considered to be pfic stock subject to the default rules of section  of the code under rules described below if the company was a pfic the holding period for the option warrant or other right would begin on the day after the date a us holder acquired the option warrant or other right this would impact the availability of the qef election and marktomarket election with respect to an option warrant or other right thus a us holder would have to account for an option warrant or other right and common shares under the pfic rules and the applicable elections differently see discussion below under “ qef election ” and “ markettomarket election ”   qef election   in the event the company is a pfic and a us holder makes a qef election for the first tax year in which its holding period of its common shares begins such us holder generally will not be subject to the rules of section  of the code discussed above with respect to its common shares however a us holder that makes a qef election will be subject to us federal income tax on such us holder’s pro rata share of a the net capital gain of the company which will be taxed as longterm capital gain to such us holder and b the ordinary earnings of the company which will be taxed as ordinary income to such us holder generally “net capital gain” is the excess of a net longterm capital gain over b net shortterm capital gain and “ordinary earnings” are the excess of a “earnings and profits” over b net capital gain a us holder that makes a qef election will be subject to us federal income tax on such amounts for each tax year in which the company is a pfic regardless of whether such amounts are actually distributed to such us holder by the company however a us holder that makes a qef election may subject to certain limitations elect to defer payment of current us federal income tax on such amounts subject to an interest charge if such us holder is not a corporation any such interest paid will be treated as “personal interest” which is not deductible   a us holder that makes a qef election generally a may receive a taxfree distribution from the company to the extent that such distribution represents “earnings and profits” of the company that were previously included in income by the us holder because of such qef election and b will adjust such us holder’s tax basis in the common shares to reflect the amount included in income or allowed as a taxfree distribution because of such qef election in addition a us holder that makes a qef election generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares   the procedure for making a qef election and the us federal income tax consequences of making a qef election will depend on whether such qef election is timely a qef election will be treated as “timely” if it is made for the first year in the us holder’s holding period for the common shares in which the company was a pfic a us holder may make a timely qef election by filing the appropriate qef election documents at the time such us holder files a us federal income tax return for such year   a qef election will apply to the tax year for which such qef election is made and to all subsequent tax years unless such qef election is invalidated or terminated or the irs consents to revocation of such qef election if a us holder makes a qef election and in a subsequent tax year the company ceases to be a pfic the qef election will remain in effect although it will not be applicable during those tax years in which the company is not a pfic accordingly if the company becomes a pfic in a subsequent tax year the qef election will be effective and the us holder will be subject to the qef rules described above during a subsequent tax year in which the company qualifies as a pfic   as discussed above under proposed treasury regulations if a us holder has an option warrant or other right to acquire stock of a pfic such option warrant or right is considered to be pfic stock subject to the default rules of section  of the code on its disposition however a holder of an option warrant or other right to acquire stock of a pfic may not make a qef election that will apply to the option warrant or other right to acquire pfic stock in addition under proposed treasury regulations if a us holder holds an option warrant or other right to acquire stock of a pfic the holding period with respect to shares of stock of the pfic acquired upon exercise of such option warrant or other right will include the period that the option warrant or other right was held us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the pfic rules to common shares        the company will make available to us holders upon their written request timely and accurate information as to its status as a pfic and will provide to a us holder all information and documentation that a us holder making a qef election with respect to the company and any subsidiary pfic in which the company owns directly or indirectly more than  of such subsidiary pfic’s total aggregate voting power is required to obtain for us federal income tax purposes in the event it is a pfic however us holders should be aware that the company can provide no assurances that it will provide any such information relating to any subsidiary pfic in which the company owns directly or indirectly  or less of such subsidiary pfic’s aggregate voting power because the company may own shares in one or more subsidiary pfics and may acquire shares in one or more subsidiary pfics in the future they will continue to be subject to the rules discussed above with respect to the taxation of gains and excess distributions with respect to any subsidiary pfic for which the us holders do not obtain the required information us holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the availability of and procedure for making a qef election with respect to the company and any subsidiary pfic   marktomarket election   a us holder may make a marktomarket election only if the common shares are marketable stock the common shares generally will be “marketable stock” if they are regularly traded on a a national securities exchange that is registered with the sec b the national market system established pursuant to section a of the securities and exchange act of  or c a foreign securities exchange that is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located provided that i such foreign exchange has trading volume listing financial disclosure and other requirements and the laws of the country in which such foreign exchange is located together with the rules of such foreign exchange ensure that such requirements are actually enforced and ii the rules of such foreign exchange ensure active trading of listed stocks if such stock is traded on such a qualified exchange or other market such stock generally will be “regularly traded” for any calendar year during which such stock is traded other than in de minimis quantities on at least  days during each calendar quarter each us holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding whether the common shares constitute marketable stock   a us holder that makes a marktomarket election with respect to its common shares generally will not be subject to the rules of section  of the code discussed above however if a us holder does not make a marktomarket election beginning in the first tax year of such us holder’s holding period for common shares or such us holder has not made a timely qef election the rules of section  of the code discussed above will apply to certain dispositions of and distributions on the common shares   a us holder that makes a marktomarket election will include in ordinary income for each tax year in which the company is a pfic an amount equal to the excess if any of a the fair market value of the common shares as of the close of such tax year over b such us holder’s tax basis in such common shares a us holder that makes a marktomarket election will be allowed a deduction in an amount equal to the excess if any of i such us holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares over ii the fair market value of such common shares but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the marktomarket election for prior tax years   us holders that make a marktomarket election generally also will adjust their tax basis in the common shares to reflect the amount included in gross income or allowed as a deduction because of such marktomarket election in addition upon a sale or other taxable disposition of common shares a us holder that makes a marktomarket election will recognize ordinary income or loss not to exceed the excess if any of a the amount included in ordinary income because of such marktomarket election for prior tax years over b the amount allowed as a deduction because of such marktomarket election for prior tax years   a marktomarket election applies to the tax year in which such marktomarket election is made and to each subsequent tax year unless the common shares cease to be “marketable stock” or the irs consents to revocation of such election us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of and procedure for making a marktomarket election   although a us holder may be eligible to make a marktomarket election with respect to common shares no such election may be made with respect to the stock of any subsidiary pfic that a us holder is treated as owning because such stock is not marketable hence the marktomarket election will not be effective to eliminate the interest charge described above with respect to deemed dispositions of subsidiary pfic stock or distributions from a subsidiary pfic        other pfic rules   under section f of the code the irs has issued proposed treasury regulations that subject to certain exceptions would cause a us holder that had not made a timely qef election to recognize gain but not loss upon certain transfers of common shares that would otherwise be taxdeferred eg gifts and exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganizations in the event the company is a pfic during such us holder’s holding period for the relevant shares however the specific us federal income tax consequences to a us holder may vary based on the manner in which common shares are transferred   certain additional adverse rules will apply with respect to a us holder if the company is a pfic regardless of whether such us holder makes a qef election for example under section b of the code a us holder that uses common shares as security for a loan will except as may be provided in treasury regulations be treated as having made a taxable disposition of such common shares   in any year in which the company is classified as a pfic a us holder will be required to file an annual report with the irs containing such information as treasury regulations andor other irs guidance may require us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the requirements of filing such information returns under these rules including the requirement to file an irs form    in addition a us holder who acquires common shares from a decedent will not receive a “step up” in tax basis of such common shares to fair market value unless such decedent had a timely and effective qef election in place   special rules also apply to the amount of foreign tax credit that a us holder may claim on a distribution from a pfic   the pfic rules are complex and us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the pfic rules and how they may affect the us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of common shares in the event the company is a pfic at any time during such holding period for such common shares   information reporting backup withholding tax   certain us holders are required to report information relating to an interest in common shares subject to certain exceptions including an exception for common shares held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions by attaching a completed irs form  statement of specified foreign financial assets with their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in common shares us holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to their ownership of common shares   payments made within the united states or by a us payor or us middleman of dividends on common shares and proceeds arising from certain sales or other taxable dispositions of common shares may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax at the rate of  if a us holder a fails to furnish such us holder’s correct us social security or other taxpayer identification number generally on form w b furnishes an incorrect us taxpayer identification number c is notified by the irs that such us holder has previously failed to properly report items subject to backup withholding tax or d fails under certain circumstances to certify under penalty of perjury that such us holder has furnished its correct us taxpayer identification number and that the irs has not notified such us holder that it is subject to backup withholding tax however us holders that are corporations generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup withholding tax rules any amounts withheld under the us backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a credit against a us holder’s us federal income tax liability if any or will be refunded if such us holder timely furnishes the required information to the irs us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the information reporting and backup

metals exploration company focused on exploring and developing our mineral holdings in the ambler mining district located in alaska usa we conduct our operations through a whollyowned subsidiary novacopper us inc which is doing business as trilogy metals us “novacopper us” our upper kobuk mineral projects “ukmp” or “ukmp projects” consist of i the  owned ambler lands which host the arctic copperzincleadgoldsilver project and ii the bornite lands being explored under a collaborative longterm agreement with nana regional corporation inc “nana” a regional alaska native corporation which host the bornite carbonatehosted copper project   property review   our principal assets the ukmp projects are located in the ambler mining district in northwest alaska our ukmp projects comprise approximately  acres  hectares consisting of the ambler and bornite lands   arctic project   the ambler lands which host a number of deposits including the highgrade copperzincleadgoldsilver arctic project and other mineralized targets within a  kilometer long volcanogenic massive sulfide “vms” belt are owned by novacopper us the ambler lands are located in northwestern alaska and consist of  acres  hectares of federal patented mining claims and state of alaska mining claims within which vms mineralization has been found   we have recorded the ambler lands as a mineral property with acquisition costs capitalized and exploration costs expensed in accordance with our accounting policies as a result of the spinout of trilogy from n ovagold resources inc “novagold” in  the consolidated financial statements have been presented under the continuity of interest basis of accounting whereby the amounts are based on the amounts originally recorded by n ovagold as if we had held the property from inception        bornite project   on october   novacopper us and nana signed a collaborative agreement to explore and develop the ambler mining district under the exploration agreement and option to lease the “nana agreement” we acquired the exclusive right to explore the bornite property and lands deeded to nana through the alaska native claims settlement act “ancsa” located adjacent to the arctic project and the nonexclusive right to access and entry onto nana’s lands the agreement establishes a framework for any future development of either the bornite project or the arctic project both projects are included as part of a larger area of interest set forth in the nana agreement the agreement with nana created a total land package incorporating our ambler lands with the adjacent bornite and ancsa lands with a total area of approximately  acres  hectares   as consideration  million was paid to nana upon signing the nana agreement and we gave nana the right to appoint a member to trilogy’s board of directors before april  nana has not exercised their right to appoint a board member at this time upon the decision to proceed with development of a mine within the area of interest nana maintains the right to purchase an ownership interest in the mine equal to between  or retain a  net proceeds royalty which is payable after we have recovered certain historical costs including capital and cost of capital should nana elect to purchase an ownership interest in the mine consideration will be payable based on the elected percentage purchased and all the costs incurred on the properties less  million not to be less than zero the parties would form a joint venture and be responsible for all future costs incurred in connection with the mine including capital costs of the mine based on each party’s prorata share   nana would also be granted a net smelter return royalty between  and  upon the execution of a mining lease or a surface use agreement the amount of which is determined by the particular area of land from which production originates   we have accounted for the bornite property as a mineral property with acquisition costs capitalized and exploration costs expensed in accordance with our accounting policies   titiribi project   on june   trilogy completed an arrangement to acquire sunward resources ltd “sunward” as a result trilogy through whollyowned subsidiaries sunward investments ltd “sunward investments” owned  of the titiribi goldcopper exploration project located approximately  kilometers southwest of the city of medellin in antioquia department colombia the titiribi project’s principal mining title is concession  which was created by the consolidation of five concessions and four exploration licenses this concession comprising of an area of  hectares was registered with the national mining registry on april   and expires in    following the announcement of the sale of sunward investments see “corporate developments – sale of sunward investments ltd” and its ownership of the titiribi project we have accounted for it as a discontinued operation the financial results have been adjusted retrospectively for the treatment as a discontinued operation   corporate developments   name change    in september  we changed our name to trilogy metals inc to better reflect our company’s naturally diversified resource base the ukmp is located in the ambler mining district in northwest alaska a region known to host deposits rich in copper zinc lead gold and silver the company controls the mineral rights to approximately  acres of land containing two known mineral belts the ambler schist belt and the bornite carbonate sequence the ambler schist belt hosts vms type mineralization occurring as a series of highgrade polymetallic copperleadzincgoldsilver deposits along the entire  kilometer  mile long belt the bornite carbonate sequence hosts several copper replacement targets around the aurora and pardner hill prospects in addition to an established resource identified at bornite mineralization at bornite is open to further exploration upon opening of the markets on september   our shares began trading on the tsx and the nysemkt under the symbol “tmq” shareholders approved the name change to trilogy at our annual and special meeting of shareholders held on may        sale of sunward investments   on september   trilogy completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding shares of sunward investments to brazil resources inc “bri” for consideration of  common shares of bri of which  common shares are subject to a six month holding period and  bri warrants with each warrant exercisable into one common share of bri for a period of two years from the completion date at an exercise price of cdn the total consideration was valued at approximately  million sunward investments through a subsidiary owns  of the titiribi goldcopper exploration project on december   bri changed its name to goldmining inc   the company reclassified the operations of sunward investments as a discontinued operation retrospectively and recognized a gain on the sale of  million in the fourth quarter of    longterm incentives   during the year ended november   the board of directors approved the granting of  stock options to employees consultants and directors with various vesting terms over two years and  restricted share units “rsus” to officers vesting equally in thirds on the grant date the first anniversary of the grant date and the second anniversary of the grant date   project activities   in the spring of  we announced the release of an updated resource estimate and national instrument  technical report on the bornite project the update incorporated a new d lithology alteration and structural model for the bornite deposit as well as results from previously unsampled or partially sampled historical kennecott drill core a positive update with contained copper in indicated resources increasing from  to  million pounds constituting a  increase in contained metal total contained copper in inferred resources decreased from  to  billion pounds blbs inpit and blbs belowpit which constitutes a  decrease in contained metal due principally to moving inpit inferred resources to the indicated category we continue to evaluate geological and hydrogeological data to support internal desktop evaluations and planning of future field investigations at the bornite project   in fiscal  we expended  million on the ukmp projects mainly at arctic consisting of  million in wages and benefits  million in drilling  million in engineering expenses  million in project support expenses  million in land maintenance and permit expenses and  million in environmental studies the company completed another successful field season in  advancing the arctic deposit towards prefeasibility we accomplished a  meter drill program at the arctic project significant baseline environmental data collection and furthered the engineering of the project the summer field season was completed on time and  under budget with a total spend of  million in  the  drill program was designed to collect data for geotechnical hydrological waste rock characterization and metallurgical studies as well as further resource definition   three drill holes representing  meters drilled were designed to collect geotechnical and hydrological data within the proposed arctic openpit data collected from the geotechnicalhydrological drill program was used to update a d structure model rock mass model and hydrogeology model and these results have been integrated into a combined geotechnical model that will be used for characterization of geotechnical domains and slope stability evaluation in a future prefeasibility study   four drill holes representing  meters drilled were designed to collect metallurgical samples specifically targeting material within the initial production years of the arctic openpit a metallurgical test work program is currently underway and expected to be complete in q   six drill holes representing  meters drilled were designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the high grade polymetallic copper gold silver lead and zinc mineralization and support upgrading of inferred resources to measured and indicated resource classification within the area of the proposed arctic openpit we are pleased to announce that all six infill holes encountered mineralized intervals consistent with previous drilling conducted within the resource area on the property data collected from the drill program was used to update the d geology model the updated geology domains and drill data will be incorporated into an updated resource estimate that will support a future prefeasibility study      substantial field work was also completed to support the continuation of baseline environmental data collection during the course of the field season data collection was completed to support an aquatic survey an avian and large mammal habitat survey an archaeological survey and expansion of the wetlands delineation and surface quality work an aquatics survey of rivers and creeks over the ukmp included identification of fish species present and tissues metals testing an avian survey over the ukmp was conducted in may to identify bird nest locations with a followup survey in july to measure fledging success a habitat survey was completed in conjunction with the wetlands survey and will be used to inform future biological surveys approximately  acres were surveyed for archaeological resources in or around the potential arctic openpit and facilities locations approximately  acres of wetlands were delineated using techniques approved by the army corps of engineers ongoing baseline environmental data collection included maintenance of three hydrologic gauging stations and one meteorological station surface water quality samples were taken from sixteen surface water locations and analyzed for a full suite of parameters including total and dissolved metals   we continue to advance the acidbaseaccounting static and kinetic test work at arctic continuous downhole samples were collected from this year’s drill program to support static testing coverage over the arctic deposit onsite barrel sampling was successfully completed in the spring and fall of  to support the kinetics program and in august we achieved the week milestone for the parallel laboratory humidity cells maintenance and monitoring of all kinetic tests will continue into    the lidar survey that was incomplete last year due to weather conditions was also completed during the summer final deliverables were received this fall has have already proven helpful in supporting ongoing engineering design and geological modeling   we continued our efforts on supporting the alaska industrial development export authority aidea” throughout  towards drafting an environmental impact statement “eis” as prescribed under the national environmental policy act process to permit the ambler mining district industrial access project “amdiap” the amdiap is anticipated to provide surface access to the ambler mining district and our ukmp projects – arctic and bornite the project design is modeled on aidea’s successful delong mountain transportation system “dmts” which includes an industrial access road from the red dog mine to the dmts port aidea worked with private industry to develop the dmts industrial access road and the costs of road construction were paid back through tolls on road use amdiap once complete will provide access to the ambler mining district through gates of the arctic national preserve this access is guaranteed in the alaska national interest lands conservation act “anilca”     on october   alaska’s governor authorized aidea to begin the eis process and shortly thereafter the consolidated sf anilca applications were submitted by aidea to the relevant federal agencies including the national park service “nps” the us army corp of engineers “usace” bureau of land management “blm” us coast guard “uscg” and the us federal highway administration “fhwa” nps usace blm and fhwa have accepted the application to move forward and have determined that blm will be the lead federal agency for the eis along with nps taking the lead on the environmental and economic analysis “eea” per anilca section d a project kickoff meeting with state of alaska and federal agencies was held in early december  to discuss next steps which include the scope of work for the third party eis contractor anticipated timing of blm issuance of the notice of intent between march  and may  and nps and fhwa working on the eea more information on the amdiap and the anilca permitting process is available on aidea’s website at wwwambleraccessorg which website is not incorporated by reference   outlook   in  we will continue to advance the development of our ukmp projects we are currently working on incorporating new surface mapping a lidar survey and drill hole information into an updated d geology model for the arctic deposit the new d geology model will update structural lithology mineralization and alteration domains into an integrated geology model that can support prefeasibility level resource evaluations and mine planning in the first quarter of  we expect to complete a resource model update for the arctic project that will include new assays collected from  and  drill core specific gravity determinations collected from waste and mineralized material and aba static analyses collected from the hanging wall of the arctic deposit – these data will support upgrading of inferred resources to measured and indicated resource classification as well as future prefeasibility level mine planning and openpit design during summer  five drill holes were completed at the arctic project to support a prefeasibility level metallurgical test program we retained als metallurgy of kamloops british columbia to complete the test work the study will include confirmation of the metallurgical response of a master composite of approximately  kilograms assessment of the variance in metallurgical responses across the deposit and completion of copperlead separation testing – work is ongoing and expected to continue into the second quarter of  we continue to advance our understanding of abaml waste characterization at the arctic project in support of this task we plan to continue monthly sampling of laboratory humidity cell tests through the end of       during summer  two drill holes were completed in the openpittable ruby creek zone of the bornite deposit the core was logged as per company standard logging procedures sampled and shipped to the fairbanks warehouse where samples remained in cold storage pending processing in september  we retained sgs minerals services of burnaby british columbia to perform a mineralogical and metallurgical test program for the retained samples of the open pit zone of the bornite deposit the study will include mineralogical characterization through quantitative analysis qemscan and optimization of the metallurgical parameters to best recover the base and precious metal values in the mineralized material – work is ongoing and expected to continue into the second quarter of  in november  we retained srk consulting of vancouver british columbia to review hydrogeological conditions at the bornite property update the hydrogeological conceptual model and provide recommendations for future data collection – work is ongoing and expected to continue into the second quarter of    in the first half of  we expect to complete a number of standalone and district tradeoff studies that will include updated information on the arctic and bornite projects these tradeoff studies will guide planning of future site investigations to support prefeasibility   we continue to work with nana on workforce development within nana’s region through the oversight committee and the workforce development subcommittee nana and the company jointly work on programs to facilitate local hiring of nana shareholders the company has contributed a total of  to a scholarship fund which grants awards to nana shareholders for either i the recipient’s student expenses directly related to education ie academic education at an accredited institution or ii the recipient’s student expenses directly related to vocational or technical schooling or training at a recognized institution intended to qualify the recipient for enhanced employment opportunities the workforce development subcommittee which consists of equal representation from nana and the company will review all applications for  and will select recipients for grant awards we are committed to training and hiring locally we have been very successful in hiring nana shareholders at the ukmp projects achieving over  local hire each year over the past  years in  our field season employees consisted of  nana shareholders and in  we are committed to the continuation of hiring locally at the project   we are also working closely with aidea to amend the memorandum of understanding “mou”  originally signed in  as the industrial road route has been selected and permitting documents have been submitted to the relevant us federal agencies we will work with aidea as the proponent for the amdiap to have a direct input into the permitting process for the road and have the ability to attend meetings with the blm as the lead federal agency for the eis process        summary of results   in thousands of dollars except for per

the year ended november   we reported a net loss of  million or  basic and diluted loss per common share compared to a net loss for the corresponding period in  of  million or  basic and diluted loss per common share and a net loss of  million for the corresponding period in  or  basic and diluted loss per common share this variance was primarily due to a onetime gain on the sale of sunward investments additionally there were decreases in annual professional fees and stockbased compensation expense offset against an increase in mineral properties expenses in     the significant variance in  relates to the gain recognized on the sale of sunward investments and the titiribi project of  million pretax this was a onetime event for which there is no comparable gain in prior years additionally as a result of the sale the operations of sunward investments were reclassified as a discontinued operation retrospectively expenses of  million for the year ended november   and  million for the year ended november   related to the sunward investments operations were reclassified to discontinued operations as sunward was purchased by the company in june  there are no amounts prior to june  included in the consolidated results in addition to the gain recognized on the sale we also realized  million in gains on the sale of investments received as consideration for the year ended november     professional fees for the year ended november   were  million a reduction of  million from the  million incurred for the year ended november   and a reduction from the  million incurred for the year ended november   expenses in  were down significantly due to less corporate transaction activity as well as  million in costs related to the sale of sunward recorded in discontinued operations in  expenses were incurred for legal and technical due diligence and regulatory approvals associated with the acquisition of sunward and in  legal costs associated with private placement financing were incurred for which there is no comparable amount in the current year   the variance in the mineral properties expense was primarily due to the differing magnitude of the field programs at our ukmp project in   and  in  we completed a similarsized drill program consisting of  meters at the arctic project however we significantly increased the environmental baseline data collection and engineering site investigations compared to the  program in  we completed fourteen diamond drill holes amounting to  meters at the arctic project as well as engineering and environmental site investigations in  we completed a resampling and reassaying program of approximately  meters of historical drill core from bornite mineral property expenses consist of direct drilling personnel community resource reporting and other exploration expenses as well as indirect project support expenses such as fixed wing charters helicopter support fuel and other camp operation costs   the other reduction in expenses is from a charge of  million in stockbased compensation in  compared to  million in  and  million in  the expense recognized for the current year includes  million in expense relating to stock options and  million in expense relating to rsus and deferred share units “dsus” the  expense included  million in expense relating to stock options and  million in expense relating to dsus issued to nonexecutive directors in lieu of cash remuneration the expense recognized for  included  million in expense relating to stock options and  million in expense relating to previously granted rsus and dsus        other important variances for the year ended november   compared to the same period in  and  are as follows a  million in general and administrative expenses in  and  compared to  million in due to cost reduction efforts as well as a favorable foreign exchange movement and b  million in salaries in  compared to  million in  and  million in  primarily related to cost reduction initiatives implemented in the third quarter of  that reduced the number of employees in the corporate office the salaries in  also included a onetime severance cost of  million paid to former employees offset by a recovery of  million due to a reversal of accrued bonuses from  to employees no longer eligible to receive payment   the comparable basic and diluted loss per common share for  is lower than  and  due to the gain on the sale of sunward investments the  basic and diluted loss per common share is lower than  mainly as a result of the additional shares issued during  as a result of the sunward acquisition completed in june  as well as a lower loss figure   fourth quarter results   during the fourth quarter of  we earned income of  million compared to a net loss of  million for the comparable period in  the earnings in the fourth quarter of  were due to the gain on sale of sunward investments of  million offsetting net expenses of  million we incurred  million of mineral property expenses in the fourth quarter of  compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  for fairly comparable expenses including assaying costs from the summer drill program and engineering costs for the arctic deposit we recognized  million in foreign exchange losses in the fourth quarter of  mainly due to the movement of the canadian dollar as a result of holding the investments in bri

                                  factors that can cause fluctuations in our quarterly results include the length of the exploration field season at the properties the type of program conducted stock option vesting and issuance of shares other factors that have caused fluctuations in the quarterly results that would not be expected to reoccur include the acquisition and disposition of sunward and financing activities   our loss for the first quarter ended february   was significantly reduced in comparison to previous first quarter periods due to the company’s cost cutting efforts to reduce professional fees salaries and mineral property expenses during the first quarter of  we incurred mineral property expense of  million mainly on community support and project staff salaries as our field season this year did not commence until early in the third quarter during the second quarter of  we incurred  million in mineral property expenses the same level of activities as the first quarter of  we also incurred  million in professional fees during the second quarter of  mainly due to the acquisition of sunward during the third quarter of  we incurred mineral property expenses of  million as we completed our drilling program we also incurred  million of discontinued operation costs operating sunward as a result our loss for the third quarter ended august   is higher compared to previous quarter losses our net loss for the fourth quarter of  of  million consists of  million in mineral property expenses incurred for assay costs and engineering studies conducted in the fall as well as  million in discontinued operation costs from sunward   our loss for the first quarter ended february   is slightly increased compared to the first quarter ended february   due to increased mineral property expenses relating to engineering studies completed in advance of the  field program as well as costs related to operating sunward during the second quarter of  we incurred  million in mineral property expenses due to field season starting up in the last month of the second quarter and  million in discontinued operations relating to sunward during the third quarter of  we incurred

period in  and expenditures of  million for operating activities for the same period in  a majority of cash spent on operating activities during all periods was expended on mineral property expenses professional fees salaries and general and administrative expenses the increase in cash spent in the year ended november   is mainly due to increased mineral property expenses of  million increased discontinued operations expense of  million expended on sunward offset by decreased professional fees of  million as at november   the company continues to manage its cash expenditures and management believes that the working capital available is sufficient to meet its operational requirements for the next year future financings are anticipated through equity financing debt financing the sale of investments convertible debt or other means   during the year ended november   we raised  million in proceeds from the completion of a private placement in july  there was no comparable amount from

exercise price of  and  novagold dsus for which the holder is entitled to receive one common share for every six novagold shares received for additional information on novagold arrangement options and novagold dsus please refer to note  in our november   audited consolidated financial statements upon exercising all of forgoing convertible securities the company would be required to issue an aggregate of  common shares   financial instruments   our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deposits investments and accounts payable and accrued liabilities the fair value of the financial instruments approximates their carrying value due to the shortterm nature of their maturity our financial instruments initially measured at fair value and then held at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deposits and accounts payable and accrued liabilities our investments are held for trading and are markedtomarket at each period end with changes in fair value recorded to the statement of loss   a currency risk   currency risk is the risk of a fluctuation in financial asset and liability settlement amounts due to a change in foreign exchange rates we operate in the united states canada and previously operated in colombia with some expenses incurred in canadian dollars and colombian pesos our exposure to currency risk at november   is limited to the canadian dollar consisting of cash of cdn accounts receivable of cdn deposits amounts of cdn investments of cdn and accounts payable of cdn based on a  change in the uscanadian exchange rate assuming all other variables remain constant the company’s net loss would change by approximately    b credit risk   credit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations the company holds cash and cash equivalents with canadian chartered financial institutions the company’s accounts receivable consist of gst receivable from the federal government of canada and other receivables for recoverable expenses the company’s exposure to credit risk is equal to the balance of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable as recorded in the financial statements   c liquidity risk   liquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter difficulties raising funds to meet our financial obligations as they fall due the company does not have cash inflows from operations therefore the company manages liquidity risk through the management of our capital structure and financial leverage future financings may be obtained through debt financing equity financing sales of investments convertible debt exercise of options or other means continued operations are dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing or to generate future cash flows our contractually obligated cash flow is disclosed under the section titled “liquidity and capital resources”        d interest rate risk   interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents based on balances as at november   a  change in interest rates would result in a change in net loss of  million assuming all other variables remain constant   as we are currently in the exploration phase none of our financial instruments are exposed to commodity price risk however our ability to obtain longterm financing and its economic viability could be affected by commodity price volatility   new accounting pronouncements   certain recent accounting pronouncements have been included under note  in our november   audited consolidated financial statements   critical accounting estimates   the most critical accounting estimates upon which our financial status depends are those requiring estimates of the recoverability of our capitalized mineral properties impairment of longlived assets accounting for business combinations income taxes and valuation of stockbased compensation   mineral properties and development costs   all direct costs related to the acquisition of mineral property interests are capitalized the acquisition of title to mineral properties is a complicated and uncertain process the company has taken steps in accordance with industry standards to verify the title to mineral properties in which it has an interest although the company has made efforts to ensure that legal title to its mining assets is properly recorded there can be no assurance that such title will be secured indefinitely   impairment of longlived assets   management assesses the possibility of impairment in the carrying value of its longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable significant judgments are made in assessing the possibility of impairment management considers several factors in considering if an indicator of impairment has occurred including but not limited to indications of value from external sources significant changes in the legal business or regulatory environment and adverse changes in the use of physical condition of the asset these factors are subjective and require consideration at each period end if an indicator of impairment is determined to exist management calculates the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows relating to the asset or asset group using estimated future prices mineral resources and operating capital and reclamation costs when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value which is usually determined using discounted future cash flows management’s estimates of mineral prices mineral resources foreign exchange rates production levels and operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to risk and uncertainties that may affect the determination of the recoverability of the longlived asset   income taxes   we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties we are subject to income tax law in the united states canada and previously in colombia the evaluation of tax liabilities involving uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law new audit activity and effectively settled issues the evaluation of an uncertain tax position requires significant judgment and a change in such recognition would result in an additional charge to the income tax expense and liability   stockbased compensation   compensation expense for options granted to employees directors and certain service providers is determined based on estimated fair values of the options at the time of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model which takes into account as of the grant date the fair market value of the shares expected volatility expected life expected forfeiture rate expected dividend yield and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option the use of the blackscholes option pricing model requires input estimation of the expected life of the option volatility and forfeiture rate which can have a significant impact on the valuation model and resulting expense recorded        disclosure controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted by the company under us and

titiribi project   all figures are in united states dollars unless otherwise noted references to cdn refer to amounts in canadian dollars   these financial statements were approved by the company’s board of directors for issue on february     cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents comprise of highly liquid investments maturing less than  days from date of initial investment cash and cash equivalents are designated as loans and receivables   plant and equipment   plant and equipment are recorded at cost and amortization begins when the asset is put into service amortization is calculated on a straightline basis over the respective assets’ estimated useful lives amortization periods by asset class are   computer hardware and software  years machinery and equipment  years office furniture and equipment  years vehicles  years leasehold improvements lease term   mineral properties and development costs   all direct costs related to the acquisition of mineral property interests are capitalized mineral property exploration expenditures are expensed when incurred when it has been established that a mineral deposit is commercially mineable an economic analysis has been completed in accordance with sec industry guide  and permits are obtained the costs subsequently incurred to develop a mine on the property prior to the start of mining operations are capitalized capitalized costs will be amortized following commencement of production using the unit of production method over the estimated life of proven and probable reserves        the acquisition of title to mineral properties is a complicated and uncertain process the company has taken steps in accordance with industry standards to verify the title to mineral properties in which it has an interest although the company has made efforts to ensure that legal titles to its mining assets are properly recorded there can be no assurance that such title will be secured indefinitely   impairment of longlived assets   management assesses the possibility of impairment in the carrying value of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable management calculates the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows relating to the asset or asset group using estimated future prices proven and probable reserves and other mineral resources and operating capital and reclamation costs when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value which is usually determined using discounted future cash flows management’s estimates of mineral prices mineral resources foreign exchange rates production levels and operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to risk and uncertainties that may affect the determination of the recoverability of the longlived asset it is possible that material changes could occur that may adversely affect management’s estimates   income taxes   the liability method of accounting for income taxes is used and is based on differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting basis of assets and liabilities as well as for the benefit of losses available to be carried forward to future years for tax purposes using enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred income tax assets are evaluated and if realization is not considered more likely than not a valuation allowance is provided   uncertainty in income tax positions   the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position any tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities related interest and penalties if any are recorded as tax expense in the tax provision   financial instruments   heldfortrading financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as determined by active market prices or valuation models as appropriate valuation models require the use of assumptions which may include the expected life of the instrument the expected volatility dividend payouts and interest rates in determining these assumptions management uses readily observable market inputs where available or where not available inputs generated by management changes in fair value of heldfortrading financial instruments are recorded in income or loss for the period heldfortrading financial assets consist of common share and warrant investments in a publiclyheld mining company   availableforsale financial assets are recorded at fair value as determined by active market prices unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments are recognized in other comprehensive income if a decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary the unrealized loss is recognized in net earnings investments in equity instruments that do not have an active quoted market price are measured at cost the company has no availableforsale financial assets   loans and receivables are recorded initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method loans and receivables consist of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and deposits   other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method other financial liabilities include accounts payable and accrued liabilities   translation of foreign currencies   monetary assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollar at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect at the time of acquisition or issue income and expenses are translated at rates approximating the exchange rate in effect at the time of transactions exchange gains or losses arising on translation are included in income or loss for the period   the functional currency of the company and its subsidiaries and the company’s reporting currency is the united states dollar        earnings and loss per share   earnings and loss per common share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year the company follows the treasury

accomplish the objectives of safeguarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to pursue the development of its mineral properties and maintain a capital structure which optimizes the costs of capital at an acceptable risk the company’s current capital consists of equity funding through capital markets cash acquired from the sunward arrangement and the sale of marketable securities   as the company is currently in the exploration phase none of its financial instruments are exposed to commodity price risk however the company’s ability to obtain longterm financing and its economic viability may be affected by commodity price volatility   to facilitate the management of its capital requirements the company prepares annual expenditure budgets that are updated as necessary depending on various factors including successful capital deployment and general industry conditions    financial instruments   the company is exposed to a variety of risks arising from financial instruments these risks and management’s objectives policies and procedures for managing these risks are disclosed as follows   the company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deposits investments and accounts payable and accrued liabilities the fair value of the company’s financial instruments approximates their carrying value due to the shortterm nature of their maturity the company’s financial instruments initially measured at fair value and then held at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deposits and accounts payable and accrued liabilities the company’s investments are held for trading and are markedtomarket at each period end with changes in fair value recorded to the statement of loss   financial risk management   the company’s activities expose them to certain financial risks including currency risk credit risk liquidity risk interest risk and price risk   e currency risk   currency risk is the risk of a fluctuation in financial asset and liability settlement amounts due to a change in foreign exchange rates the company operates in the united states canada and previously operated in colombia with some expenses incurred in canadian dollars and colombian pesos the company’s exposure to currency risk at november   is limited to the canadian dollar “cdn” consisting of cash of cdn accounts receivable of cdn deposit amounts of cdn investments of cdn and accounts payable of cdn based on a  change in the uscanadian exchange rate assuming all other variables remain constant the company’s net loss would change by approximately    f credit risk   credit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations the company holds cash and cash equivalents with canadian chartered financial institutions the company’s accounts receivable consist of gst receivable from the federal government of canada and other receivables for recoverable expenses the company’s exposure to credit risk is equal to the balance of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable as recorded in the financial statements   g liquidity risk   liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulties raising funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due the company is in the exploration stage and does not have cash inflows from operations therefore the company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure and financial leverage      contractually obligated cash flow requirements as at november   are as follows   in thousands of dollars     total        year      – years      – years      thereafter    accounts payable and accrued

the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents based on balances as at november   a  change in interest rates would result in a change in net loss of  million assuming all other variables remain constant   as we are currently in the exploration phase none of our financial instruments are exposed to commodity price risk however our ability to obtain longterm financing and its economic viability could be affected by commodity price volatility   fair value accounting   financial instruments measured at fair value are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level  — quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and level  — prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable supported by little or no market activity   the levels in the fair value hierarchy into which the company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis were categorized as follows in thousands of dollars     november        november          level      level      level      level      level      level    current investments – shares                                           investments – warrants                                             the company’s investments consist of shares and warrants in a publiclyheld mining company the share investments are recorded as current investments and are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified as a level  financial instrument the warrants are valued using a blackscholes pricing model and are considered a level  financial instrument because the valuation models have significant unobservable inputs    income taxes   income tax expense differs from the amount that would result from applying the canadian federal and provincial income tax rates to earnings before income taxes these differences result from the following items        in thousands of dollars     november        november        november      combined federal and provincial statutory tax rate                   income taxes at statutory rate                   difference in foreign tax rates

may be available for tax purposes certain of these losses occurred prior to the incorporation of the company and are accounted for in the financial statements as if they were incurred by the company as described in note  prior to the novagold arrangement the company undertook a tax reorganization in order to preserve the future deductibility of these losses for the company subject to the limitations below deferred tax assets have been recognized to the extent of future taxable income and the future taxable amounts related to taxable temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability is recognized can be offset a valuation allowance has been provided against deferred income tax assets where it is not more likely than not that the company will realize those benefits   the
