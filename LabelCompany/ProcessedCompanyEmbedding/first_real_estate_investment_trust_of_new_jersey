cautionary statement identifying important factors that could cause freits actual results to differ from those projected in forward looking statements readers of this discussion are advised that the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of freit including related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k certain statements in this discussion may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  forwardlooking statements reflect freits current expectations regarding future results of operations economic performance financial condition and achievements of freit and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts freit has tried wherever possible to identify these forwardlooking statements by using words such as believe expect anticipate intend  plan  estimate or words of similar meaning overview freit is an equity real estate investment trust reit that is selfadministered and externally managed freit owns a portfolio of residential apartment and commercial properties our revenues consist primarily of fixed rental income from our residential and commercial properties and additional rent in the form of expense reimbursements derived from our income producing commercial properties our properties are primarily located in northern new jersey and maryland we acquire existing properties for investment we also acquire properties that we feel have redevelopment potential and we make changes and capital improvements to these properties we develop and construct properties on our vacant land our policy is to acquire and develop real property for longterm investment the economic and financial environmentthe recovery in the us has finally gained traction a the housing market continues to improve b inflation is expected to remain in check c consumer spending is increasing modestly d private sector employment is growing steadily and e credit availability has improved these factors should continue to aid economic growth in the united states residential properties we have aggressively increased rental rates as a result our rental rates continue to show yearoveryear increases however this practice has increased the vacancies in some of our residential properties in the shortterm we expect this aggressive rental rate policy will more than offset shortterm rental revenue losses resulting from increased vacancies we expect increases in rental rates to taper however the increased rental rates that are in place should positively impact future revenues commercial properties the retail outlook has shown improvement because of increases in consumer spending over the past year and this improvement is expected to continue over the next couple of years development projects and capital expenditures we continue to make only those capital expenditures that are absolutely necessary as of november  the expansion and renovation of the damascus center was completed on july   the freit board of trustees approved revisions to the scope of the rotunda redevelopment project thereby reducing the complexity and projected cost of the project in order to avoid beginning construction during the winter months rotunda began construction on the parking lot areas in september  debt financing availabilityfinancing for development projects has become more available as a result on december   grande rotunda llc closed with wells fargo bank on a construction loan of up to  million to be used for the purpose of funding the major redevelopment and expansion project planned for the rotunda operating cash flow and dividend distributions we expect that cash provided by net operating income will be adequate to cover mandatory debt service payments excluding balloon payments necessary capital improvements and dividends necessary to retain qualification as a reit  of taxable income until the economic climate indicates that a change is appropriate it is freits intention to maintain its quarterly dividend at a level not less than that required to maintain its reit status for federal income tax purposes table of contents significant accounting policies and estimates pursuant to the sec disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of which takes into account estimates based on judgments and assumptions that affect certain amounts and disclosures accordingly actual results could differ from these estimates the accounting policies and estimates used which are outlined in note  to our consolidated financial statements which is presented elsewhere in this form k have been applied consistently as at october   and october   and for the years ended october    and  we believe that the following accounting policies or estimates require the application of managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments revenue recognition base rents additional rents based on tenants sales volume and reimbursement of the tenants share of certain operating expenses are generally recognized when due from tenants the straightline basis is used to recognize base rents under leases if they provide for varying rents over the lease terms straightline rents represent unbilled rents receivable to the extent straightline rents exceed current rents billed in accordance with lease agreements before freit can recognize revenue it is required to assess among other things its collectibility valuation of longlived assets we periodically assess the carrying value of longlived assets whenever we determine that events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable when freit determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may be impaired the measurement of any impairment is based on a projected discounted cash flow method determined by freits management while we believe that our discounted cash flow methods are reasonable different assumptions regarding such cash flows may significantly affect the measurement of impairment real estate development costs it is freits policy to capitalize predevelopment costs which generally include legal and professional fees and other directly related thirdparty costs real estate taxes and interest costs incurred during the development and construction phases are also capitalized freit ceases capitalization of these costs when the project or portion thereof becomes operational or when construction has been postponed capitalization of these costs will recommence once construction on the project resumes adopted and recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  property plant and equipment topic  derecognition of in substance real estatea scope clarification the purpose of this update is to resolve the diversity in practice about whether the guidance under fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  property plant and equipmentreal estate sales applies to a parent that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary as specified under asc subtopic  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no  that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiarys nonrecourse debt the new guidance is intended to emphasize that accounting for such transactions is based on their substance rather than their form specifically that the parent should only deconsolidate the real estate subsidiary when legal title to the real estate is transferred to the lender and the related nonrecourse debt has been extinguished the standard takes effect for public companies for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june   the adoption of this guidance in the year ended october   did not have any impact on our financial statements in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income which supersedes the presentation options in asc topic  reporting of comprehensive income the new standard provides guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements the new guidance only affects the presentation of comprehensive income and not the components that must be reported therein the standard takes effect for public companies effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   the company adopted this standard on november   and elected to present a separate consolidated statement of comprehensive income in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no  this update stated that the specific requirement in asu  to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this update requires companies to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the amount being reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles to be reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period asu  is effective prospectively for the company for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted the company has

is a single tenanted store in addition freit owns land in rockaway nj and rochelle park nj from which it receives monthly rental income from tenants who have built and operate bank branches on the land as indicated in the table above under the caption segment information total revenue and noi from freits commercial segment for fiscal  decreased by  and  respectively as compared to fiscal  the major contributing factors to the overall decline in revenue for fiscal  were the vacancy resulting from the termination of the giant lease for  square feet of space at the rotunda property in february  and  in nonrecurring easement income recognized by the franklin crossing shopping center in franklin lakes nj during the th quarter of fiscal  it is not anticipated that the giant space at the rotunda or a reconfiguration of this space will be leased until the redevelopment of the rotunda is completed see discussion below the decrease in rental revenue for the current year was slightly offset by a lower level of administrative expenses for fiscal  primarily due to a higher level of bad debt expense incurred in fiscal  same property operating results freits commercial segment
