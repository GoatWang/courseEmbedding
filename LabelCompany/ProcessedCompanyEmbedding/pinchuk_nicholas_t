provide an update on the environment and speak a bit about our trends aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials in the third quarter we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement and we saw those gains across our operating segments organic sales were up  from last year opco operating margin it reached  up  basis points when you add the  million in operating earnings from financial services up from  million in  the consolidated operating margin was  an increase of  basis points and eps eps was  up  or  from the  of last year our reported sales increase was  including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and in this quarter that total was  million about the same as the second quarter adding the incremental  million sales from our third quarter acquisition of ecotechnics the total reported sales for the period were  million for automotive repair businesses the environment continues to be favorable actually its been that way for a while and our tools group and repair systems  information our rsi group are both well positioned to take full advantage you can see it in the performance another quarter of solid gains for both groups advancing along our runways for growth clearly the tools group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network gains in all its markets continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet not only in the united states but in places like the uk and australia and rsi with strong sales across north america and parts of europe doubledigit growth in the us and modest gains in western europe offsetting the continuing softness in eastern europe and particularly in russia rsi progress achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers and with oem dealerships advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings for the commercial  industrial our ci group we overcame some increased headwinds with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies that said in the third quarter our european based hand tool businesses and our asia pacific operations recorded highsingledigit gains overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets now our industrial division did have some headwinds in the period impacted by weak us military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity weve consistently mentioned the uncertainty associated with the military in the third quarter that caution materialized and our results included a doubledigit decrease measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict within our natural resources segment volume in oil and gas was down substantially you see it in oil prices and you read about it in the newspapers and despite our small share and opportunities for penetration we were impacted but that said saying that there will always be headwinds theyve been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame because were well positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth enhancing the franchise network expanding the repair shop owners and managers extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets these do represent the avenues for advancement and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths at the same time those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of snapon value creation safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement or rci these are the processes the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation customer connection snapons continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals innovation taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technologies and in the quarter those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the corporation we were again honored with two motor magazine top  tool awards the winners this time are inch drive steering rack sockets and our solus edge diagnostic handheld lets talk about the steering rack socket the s was developed from a customer connection derived from direct observation of work and from conversations with multiple technicians this innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering orings without removing the whole steering assembly saving up to an hour of labor clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive in addition also created out of deep insight in the repair process the innovative solus edge coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems including hybrid tpms steering and clean diesel and it all comes loaded with our fasttrack troubleshooter database with its vehicle specific tips tests and time savers the solus edge is enhanced coverage for over  car makes without the cost or complexity of factory scan tools and for all its power for all its strength its easy to use the large inch touchscreen display is an aid to visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as  seconds quick i mention these awards because theyre just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages created by the observations of our franchisees and direct salespeople who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovations and that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter now lets focus on those individual groups starting with commercial  industrial organic sales were up  operating margins reached  up  basis points from last years  growth along with the benefits of snapon value creation now i said as we said there are headwinds but our industrial direct salesmen have been expanding their reach nevertheless into sectors like railroads up doubledigits growing our presence offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions weve spoken in the past about building our understanding of work in critical industries expanding our customer connections well one way thats happening is by using our experience in rci participating in customer lean events participating in the customer sponsored lean events our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations while at the same time gaining a better understanding of their work processes their product requirements their business needs and their overall industry direction all key customer connections gained through lean event participation one of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of tube wrenches great for heavyduty work on railroad cars and tracks made in our elizabethton tennessee plant these tube wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad applications allowing the operator better access eliminating the need for costly twoperson slugging procedures and making work easier safer and more productive lets speak about sna europe now eight quarters in a row of yearoveryear growth navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies sna europe activities continues to be encouraged – activity continues to be encouraging but its profits are even more positive now up significantly for  straight quarters and we believe theres much more room for further gains and related to our asia pacific operations the environments are mixed but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like thailand and indonesia and vietnam actually its nice to see progress in vietnam that emerging southeast asia nation so that provides a bit of color on ci now on to the tools group organic sales up   significant growth in the us and internationally operating income  million compared to  million in  operating income margins of  rose  basis points from last years  the additional volume as well as operating improvements from rci translated into significant margin improvement and that  basis point gain overcame  basis points of negative currency when you consider the tools groups success you see the power of snapon value creation and the benefits of our awardwinning innovative new products besides the motor top  award the tools group also received recognition from the readers of professional tool  equipment news gaining five peoples choice selections for new tool innovation products once again born at the intersection between customer connection insight and advanced technology wielded by our innovation teams products like the krl inch roll cab with its power tool organizer system the powerful and light ct volt cordless impact wrench our new brake caliper press our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability and our new eet full view welding helmet all selected by the readers of pten magazine and by our technician customers as great new products products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of snapon innovation you might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual snapon franchisees conference our sfc this year it was in washington dc with more than  attendees franchise and family members from over  routes three days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel to amplify the power of our van space and of our franchisees time and based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees it was a strong success and by the way orders were up once again beating the record level achieved in  when we speak of the van channel we also have to consider the very strategic contributions of snapon credit our financial services arm helps create opportunities across our organization but especially within the tools group and credit had a strong presence at the sfc supporting franchisees with unique programs enabling sales of those big ticket items which are so essential to franchisee success and in the third quarter financial services oi was up  million or  another period of powerful contribution to the organization lets move to rsi organic sales were up  the operating margin of  it increased  basis points from  just last year rsi was charged with expanding our presence to repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter it did just that we once again had growth in our businesses providing repair information and diagnostics to independents in fact we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions in automotive in medium and in heavy duty garages serving both oem dealerships as well as those independent shops all fueled by our expanding product offering and one of those great rsi product came from our diagnostics division demonstrating its continuing innovation our diagnostics team launched its new verus edge handheld an enhanced topoftheline offering thinner lighter including important features like fivesecond readytouse capability fivehour battery life a solid state hard drive for increased durability and of course access to our unique integrated suretrack realworld fixes based on masses of actual repair data all features guided by effective customer connection input in the verus edge we believe we have in it a winner advancing the stateoftheart and addressing the most serious of repair challenges and initial sales of breaking the records and exceeding our expectations also in the third quarter and with the focus on heavy duty shops rsi introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface the nexiq usblink  now with wifi connectivity it extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of nexiq heavy duty diagnostics product the usblink  is compatible with heavy duty diagnostic applications for engines transmission abs and instrument clusters and much more it supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol and nearly every software application in vehicle sectors like construction agriculture and of course heavy duty truck five times the speed of its predecessors with  times the memory the usblink  is perfect for dealership fleets and truck shops it speeds the repair times of these particularly mission critical vehicles and it improves technician productivity its a great upgrade to an already successful product of our rsi group also in the third quarter our equipment division registered high singledigit growth with strong volume in north america helping to offset the russian market which is our primary headwind in eastern europe overall undercar gains in the us were quite solid with especially impressive increase – sales increases at our challenger lifts division challenger has been a great addition to our snapon team and it improved again this quarter and we believe there is much more to come helping rsi to expand with repair shop owners and managers rsi great new product with demonstrated growth in diagnostics heavy duty and undercar equipment and all of that played out in the third quarter results well thats the highlights of our quarter organic sales up  gains across all groups clear progress along our runways for growth snapon value creation at the forefront of our activities customer connection leading to innovation creating powerful new products rci driving improvement and it all shows in the results oi margin to  up  basis points it was an encouraging quarter now ill turn the call over to aldo aldo aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer thanks nick our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six net sales of  million in the quarter were up  organically on a reported basis net sales including  million of unfavorable foreign currency increased to  as you know snapon has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations largely due to the strengthening of the us dollar foreign currency movements adversely impacted our q sales comparisons by  basis points net sales in the third quarter also included  million of sales from our july  acquisition of ecotechnics a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for oem dealerships and independent repair shops consolidated gross profit of  million increased  million from  levels primarily due to the higher sales and savings from rci initiatives

our segment results starting with the commercial  industrial or ci group on slide  sales of  million in the quarter were up  organically driven primarily by high singledigit gains in both the segments europeanbased hand tools business and asiapacific operations and a doubledigit increase in the segments power tools operations these sales increases were partially offset by a mid singledigit decline in sales to customers in critical industries primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector gross profit in the ci group of  million in the quarter

pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer thanks aldo snapon third quarter sales up organically  against some significant headwinds of course as we say often there will always be headwinds always be challenges but in the midst of that we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups ci in the center of the turbulence sales up  profits up  basis points rsi wielding software and hardware with repair shop owner and managers activity rising  and oi margin of  up  basis points tools an established and storied business reaching higher capturing more customers sales up  and a greater than  increase in  of the last  quarters oi margin up  basis points despite  basis points of unfavorable currency and beside that growth we see the effects of snapon value creation paving our runways for improving helping to drive our opco margin to  up  basis points including  basis points of currency headwinds and rolling all together with financial services our eps was  up  we believe that the third quarter results extending our positive trends continuing confirmation of the snapon possibilities for both growth and for improvement and we believe as demonstrated this past quarter we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward now before i turn the call over to the operator for questions i think its appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates i know many of you are listening in again the encouraging results of the third quarter and our positive trends are a direct reflection of your capability and your effort for the gains youve achieved you have my congratulations and for your commitment and your extraordinary contribution to our team you have my thanks now ill turn the call over to the operator operator questionandanswer session operator thank you well take our first question from bret jordan with jefferies your line is now open bret jordan  jefferies llc hi good morning guys nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer good morning aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer good morning bret jordan  jefferies llc a question on rsi you mentioned specific strength in undercar and service chain reported this morning it had an  comp in alignment is there something structurally going on in that space driving growth or is yours tied to new product introduction this row  deterioration is a secular shift or nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i think structurally – not something happened and i dont think this particular quarter but i think structurally the whole automotive repair business is – got a nice tailwind in terms of changes in vehicles and in fact as you have more vehicles that want to do more things automatically selfdriving and so on the precision of calibration becomes more and more important and therefore the more accuracy and speed – more accuracy – things like alignment become more important and therefore the speed of that alignment becomes important therefore the need for new products and so i think its nice times for automotive repair in general and in particular for undercar equipment and i think bret jordan  jefferies llc and i guess nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer ours being pushed by both at tailwind and some nice new product thats in place as well bret jordan  jefferies llc okay and i guess on that speed of change in technology – is sort of the next question the software upgrade cycle as you were looking in the handheld units and replacing software is that accelerating at all or is the new code basically at the same cadence nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i think its expanding i think were finding – i dont know if were introducing any faster necessarily upgrades but i think the upgrades are more attractive you hear me talk about suretrack and if i had a little more time to talk about verus edge i would talk about the fact that it has technical service bulletins involved and so those products are more attractive and theyre more liberating and theyre more productivity advancing to customers and so thats driving part of that you can see it you can see – and im sure youve looked at the trends and you can see that i think the numbers are something like somewhere under  of cars – we today require in all garages require diagnostics repairs and all garages require diagnostics units but something like  of  repairs in new cars require diagnostics units so you see a demand for that and our software is the best available one of the things you see in our – one of the things were really excited about in our business when we did independent surveys of technician preferences  said they preferred snapon diagnostics number two was  bret jordan  jefferies llc okay nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer does it help bret jordan  jefferies llc thanks and one question i guess specifically to ci on the us military you talked about it being particularly weak when they are weak are they buying less premium product or not buying at all i mean are they going to harbor freight for what they would have purchased for you or did they just step out nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer no no i dont think they are buying that stuff im not sure but im pretty sure that they are not buying the stuff because you know when the  caliber bullets are flying over head i think this is the ultimate critical application and i dont think anybody wants anybody being disadvantaged under those circumstances so what really has happened by and large is the fact that theres uncertainty in where to deploy budget around weve seen it before actually ci if you go back and look at the late – in late  the critical industries the critical industries again was bedeviled by a reduction associated with the military and that was directly associated with the word as sequestration and so youre starting to see those kinds of things now in washington people are talking about government shutdowns and so on and its making the military nervous and they are spending less we feel were pretty well positioned though to take full advantage when they are ready to spend bret jordan  jefferies llc okay great so its not trading down its just not spending nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer no no not any significant way bret jordan  jefferies llc okay great thank you nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from liam burke with wunderlich your line is now open liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc thank you good morning nick good morning aldo nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer good morning liam how are you liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc good thank you nick you talked about railroad as being an interesting growth segment in ci are there any other areas that saw particular strength during the quarter in the ci nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yeah look we were – amazingly were up pretty well in mining like i said were still starting to penetrate these things so you cant – were finding that were effective sometimes by – somewhat by the environment but not – we can overcome it at times and mining was one of those heavy truck was up fairly well in the quarter so that was a good entry general if you just look at general production the kinds of stuff the things that are associated with grinders and so on we had that kind of thing so i mean we had some fairly reasonable positive points the us aviation the aviation in us was okay that kind of thing liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc okay nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer so we had some positives and we had oil and gas international aviation and the military which were negative liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc okay and with your van channel being supported now with rock n roll vans are you seeing any step up in average ticket item per franchisee during the quarter nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer no big ticket was still reasonably strong but i think were not seeing any particular if the question is associated with the rise in the size of the – lets say the purchases the size of the purchases i would say no in the quarter necessarily not anything particularly big in the quarter nothing that would change the trend were still seeing a robust demand though for things like tool storage and of course our diagnostic units and other things that we would roll into big ticket liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc great thank you nick nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from gary prestopino with barrington your line is now open gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc hi good morning everyone nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer good morning gary gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc couple of the questions have been answered particularly on industrial but let me just ask in terms of seeing pretty good growth yearoveryear in the credit portfolio is that still indicative of that there is a healthy appetite for the tool boxes bigger ticket items nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yeah theres a healthy – i think theres a healthy attitude generally it directly reflects the motion of the tools group in general if you look back at originations and look at tools group growth over the last three quarters theyre sort of the same so thats pretty much whats driving it i think its not just tool boxes though you get – you will get things like – you get things like big diagnostics like the verus edge i mean the new verus edge is a product that will run in several thousands of dollars and that can be financed on that kind of things so you will see a number of things like that so its not just tool boxes but it is – the big ticket items were i think this quarter just slightly below somewhat below the tools group in general but over three quarters four quarters has been better than the tools group gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay and then in terms of the rock n roll vans and the techno vans are you at capacity where you want to be right now in the us nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont know i think rock n roll cab i think we added like maybe like five in the last quarter in the techno vans and we didnt add any rock n roll cabs rock n roll cabs have been solid for some time having said – been the same number for some time but you know i wouldnt necessarily sign up to the idea that i wouldnt add more going forward rock n roll cabs were introduced somewhere in  and i have to tell you gary weve been learning about how to use them better and how effective they are and where theyre most effective and how to do that each quarter but for now theyre pretty much where theyre going to be the techno is something else so weve added quite a few i think actually yearoveryear for techno weve added  techno vans and i think well be probably trying to see how that  plays out for a little while and then well make a decision whether we need more or not going forward but its a mistake to think that tool storage sales is directly proportional to the number of rock n roll cabs thats not true what we found is theyve gotten more and more and more productive more and more liberating every time every quarter and same thing for techno vans gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc all right well it basically expands your store for selling space right nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer correct it does but then we find out how to – then actually what we find out is how to amplify the rock n roll space i mean its kind of a multilayered thing it does help that though i mean in one sense it expands on a timesharing basis the space but the effect of that space i would say over the four years weve had it the ones that we installed first are helping a lot more than they did when they first occurred gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc and last question is this just the us phenomenon or is this in other countries where mechanics own the tools that you have these kind of vans nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer its in other countries i mean i think i guess we have seven international rock n roll cabs and so weve used them in different places things like the uk in canada and some in australia and weve just started to do that for the techno vans so its a phenomenon that can work in other places gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc thank you very much nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from david leiker with baird your line is now open david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker good morning everyone nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer good morning david aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer good morning david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker so a couple of things back on ci thats a business youve got three or four different buckets of businesses within there aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer we do david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker tends to be a little bit lumpy quartertoquarter its kind of a strange question but is there any way or anything that we from the outside should look at to try and get a better handle on what the quartertoquarter trends are going to be there nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont really have – the thing is that – the truth is sure what we know is the industry problems the economic environments create an overhang and then in places like for us and you see it in oil and gas this time you can see it in mining although mining was a contributory for us so its very difficult to look at any macro and say its going to affect us all you can say is look the general macro is going to create an overhang how well we do in offsetting it is another question but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time like in this quarter we felt we feel when we look at industrial when we look at critical industries we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter it was a drag on us this time because we can see the gains in railroad in places like mining and heavy duty so we can see the proofofconcept working through its hard for us to give you any guidance on that in asia pacific for example the turbulence around asia pacific did really create an overhang for us but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation in europe it seems like and i think whats worked for us in europe is we came from such a low position we kept investing we create new product that were growing even as the market is tepid so its kind of a cocktail of things that i cant quite give you any particular macro on which to trend david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah i figured that nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer all i can tell you is i think we feel progress in each of those places david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah i just figured that was the answer on asia pacific nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yeah yeah david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker that business over the years youve continued to see strong growth on the automotive equipment side of that business whats the makeup of that revenue today between equipment versus the critical industries versus other pieces nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont really have the percentages for you i will say that youre right in saying that equipment is probably the biggest piece of that and then youve got cutting tools which are another piece of it which are primarily industrial based industrial based tools are another piece and then whats after that it would be id say the critical – we call them – in that world  we call them premium tools like the snapon tools sold into the superpremium applications like thai airways and things like that we actually had a pretty good quarter with those in places like singapore and hong kong and the equipment actually was one of the things that drove us into vietnam were actually pretty pleased about vietnam ive been waiting for vietnam to give us some daylight for some time and this is the quarter which it kind of worked so it was an encouraging event david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker great and then one last item here on margins you guys did a great job of continuing to drive value and drive margins with the rci activity and the focus on execution are you doing anything beyond what you normally do cost cutting or pulling back on discretionary spending or anything along those lines belt tightening with some of the uncertainties going on around the world nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer no were not doing anything like that i mean i suppose its kind of dumb thing for a guy like me to say that but the fact our – we – okay people here are shaking their heads yes that is dumb but okay david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker so am i nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer its true we believe in our runways for growth and we continue to invest in them the profit improvements you are seeing the  basis points have nothing to do with restriction nothing david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker okay nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer because we dont see it that way of course there are headwinds and they might impact us and i never said we would keep going marching upward every quarter its almost impossible for anybody to do that although we have and so we just believe in the future of extending the critical industries enhancing the van channel expanding with repair shop owners and in emerging markets so we keep investing in it david leiker  robert w baird  co inc broker okay perfect great thank you very much nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer okay operator our next question comes from david macgregor with longbow research your line is now open david s macgregor  longbow research llc yeah good morning everyone and nick congratulations on a great quarter nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer thanks david s macgregor  longbow research llc let me start off with just continuing on the point we were just discussing and you talked about the fact that there wasnt a lot of belt tightening in this but then you cite rci progress in each of the individual segments so let me reconcile this it seems as though there has been some cost cutting im looking specifically at the ci segment where you had a negative  incremental margin in other words revenues were down but ebit was up and i know youve said repeatedly in the past that your rci would allow you to grow margins in a flat revenue environment help me understand the answer you just gave to the last question versus these points nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure first of all first of all we view  you may not like this either  but we view asreported sales as arithmetic organic sales are up for us so the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms we sell more of that were happy were encouraged by that so even in ci which was down that  organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain thats one two is is that what you see in this situation is when im talking about rci im talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively we reduce the setup times in the factory which is a big deal for us we find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper remember in ci for example last year in aviation we brought – last year in oil and gas i think we – for heavy truck lets say we brought out  new products and aviation was  and one of the things that allows us to make to do that better is new technology like d printing and finite element analysis and so on and that cuts cost in the design cycle and allows us to bring out those new products with lower cost than before those are the kinds of things we do david s macgregor  longbow research llc okay nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer and even if we have – so even if we have lower as reported revenues our cost gets driven down because of some of that and it doesnt happen every quarter if it happens – if i reduce the cost of one particular product well maybe that product sells well this quarter and i get some good benefit out of it that may not sell so well next quarter and i dont quite get the quote at the same benefit david s macgregor  longbow research llc okay i appreciate that clarification nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer okay david s macgregor  longbow research llc yeah i appreciate the clarification thanks on the originations its up  once again its kind of an up  number last quarter is that really just timing nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yeah its pretty much yeah theres a lot of timing flowing through remember that originations have to do with the franchisees selling the products david s macgregor  longbow research llc right nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer right and you also got an sfc that flows through this so in originations are things like loans that go through for the franchisees themselves like van loans and things like that that occur and so theres that noise in van originations in the month so when we have a particularly great sfc that can distort that as well but when you step back and you look at the trend of everything it really is – there is a lot of noise from quartertoquarter youve kind of got to look back and if you look at three quarters youll see its pretty close to the same between tools group growth and originations pretty close to the same and if you say that tools group will pick a group faster it makes sense david s macgregor  longbow research llc okay military and oil and gas is there any way you can size that up for us as a percentage of critical industries nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer okay  ill try this – how about this one we mentioned like five segments six segments in critical industries and the military is a big one its the biggest because we entered there first because it made sense just as i said before when the bullets are flying overhead  i can assure you this from personal experience when the bullets are flying overhead people kind of want to make sure things work and so we figured it was the most critical of industries we invested in it and it  warrants bigger so if you take our revenues which is somewhere north of  million or something like that lets say and you divide them by six and you take one of the bigger ones that would be the military and oil and gas would be more in the middle some place so that helps i think that should give you some ballpark view of this you got one big guy who is down strong double digits can put a little over hang on you david s macgregor  longbow research llc okay let me just ask one last question just relating to the call here and just kind of a big picture high level question but if you could just walk us through with some quick comments on each of the four segments you just discussed recessionary environment how much downside would you expect in revenues and also i guess with all the progress in rci initiatives and the new product introductions in the much richer portfolio how much better if at all would margins be in the trough than what we saw last time around nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer last time around we started at  and went to  the  if i remember  the oi percentage was like  and it went to  david s macgregor  longbow research llc yeah nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer and that was – the  was i would say artificially depressed by the fact that we had the credit company in transition somewhat not huge but thats a factor there a little bit and so you can say all right it impacted some but maybe not much but okay we had that transition going on in tools group and so on maybe arithmetically it didnt affect but down there we had some turbulence and so then the big difference there now is were starting at  all right so i mean i wouldnt expect it to be worse than that duration the other factor id offer is this is i believe – two factors one is i believe we are stronger in our market positions therefore even more resistant number one number two – number three and this is harder to predict last time our customer base which was principally the –  of the customer base the automotive repair technician i spent a lot of time talking about the fact that they were cash rich and confidence poor they were getting up every day and reading bad news for breakfast it was the worst recession of our lifetime people were talking about putting dollars in mattresses well im not sure – and so therefore they didnt buy big ticket items even though they had a lot of cash that would happen again but im not sure itd be the same extent i dont know thats a judgment call of course and one more experience at rci than we were and the other thing is were just better at rci and so we probably step that up if you cant you only have  hours in a day so if you cant – if you think the prospects for growth are less you turn more toward improvement david s macgregor  longbow research llc thats really helpful thanks a lot nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from tom hayes with northcoast research your line is now open tom l hayes  northcoast research partners llc thank you good morning gentlemen nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer good morning aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer good morning tom l hayes  northcoast research partners llc just as it relates to the tools group certainly positive results from both the domestic and international businesses nick i was wondering if you could maybe give a little additional color in regards to the contribution for the international franchise business in the tools group nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer the international franchise business is about is also up doubledigits the us is up strong doubledigits the us is up the international is up just about the same i would say that in order the strength australia and uk were actually up more than the us canada was up somewhat less so you put those together in a cocktail and i think it all came to about the same as the us tom l hayes  northcoast research partners llc okay and then i guess looking a little bit of bigger picture i think youve kind of tested on some components so far today clearly an opportunity for you is to get a larger percentage of the shop related spending just what are your thoughts on where you are on the penetration rates when you look at complete shop spending and some of your initiatives to expand that nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer well lets look at it this way i think i would say that we are less than half of where we are in terms of our position with tools and so if you think of it that way yes people respect our brand shop owners respect our brand as much as technicians so i would view that as kind of an – view of the opportunity we think we have runway in the tools itself for the technicians and were well behind that in terms of shop penetration so i think weve got quite a bit of runway there i would say if you want to use baseball terms were in the third or fourth inning tom l hayes  northcoast research partners llc great thank you operator and it appears we have no further questions at this time ill turn it back to leslie kratcoski for any closing remarks leslie h kratcoski  vice presidentinvestor relations thanks everyone for joining us this morning a replay and transcript of the call will be

now turn the call over to nick pinchuk nick nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer thanks leslie good morning everybody ill start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year as usual ill give you my perspective on the results on the environment and on our progress and after that aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials the snapon fourth quarter organic sales up and profits well above last year the period continued our positive trajectory of performance again this quarter we had opportunities and we had headwinds we took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds organic sales grew  if we include the impact of  million of unfavorable foreign currency translation overall sales in the quarter were  million a small decrease from last year our eps was  up  from  in  and that rise reflects an opco operating margin of  an increase of  basis points financial service earnings of  million in the quarter were also up leading to a consolidated operating margin including both financial services and opco of  an improvement of  basis points the results were encouraging our markets the automotive repairrelated segments they continue to be favorable changing technologies and aging vehicles are requiring new tools and more repairs our tools group and our repair systems  information or the rsi group took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers now for our commercial  industrial group or our ci group markets were mixed headwinds a bit more pronounced in the quarter impacted by few down sectors and macro economically challenged geographies leading to organic volume just under  a couple of those difficult environments were natural resources and the us military both substantially lower in the fourth quarter oil and gas a market weve identified as a longterm strategic growth opportunity for us and we continue to see it that way but in the quarter we experienced similar issues to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline the military sales ongoing troop drawdowns and budget restraints led to a substantial yearoveryear drop but we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and were poised to increase our position when the variability subsides cis also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe and some of the european markets and in parts of asia pacific that said ci progressed through the quarterly headwinds taking advantage of the opportunities in critical industries like aviation and in national markets like japan and germany and mexico and in emerging markets like india and indonesia so overall our businesses i would characterize – overall across our businesses i would characterize our markets as mixed we have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies having said that we believe that our businesses are wellpositioned to capitalize on the possibilities opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth enhancing the van network expanding with snapons presence with repair shop owners and managers extending into critical industries and building in emerging markets these are the strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future and well continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward and also looking ahead we also see clear runways for improvement snapon value creation processes safety quality customer connection innovation rapid continuous improvement or rci driving significant progress and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities lets speak about the full year snapons eps in  was  an increase of  driving those earnings was an opco earnings margin of  up  basis points for the full year and when we include the income from financial services of  million which rose  million the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was  up  basis points that performance came on sales for the year of  billion reflecting a  organic increase broad growth tools group up  rsi increasing  ci rising  all performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement now lets move to the groups and their fourth quarter results ci sales were down in the period  from  impacted by  basis points of unfavorable currency organic sales were slightly lower than last year with varied results across the group gains by sna europe our european hand tools business and the power tools operation and decreases at the industrial division from an earnings perspective ci operating income was  million that represents an operating margin of  a rise of  basis points encouragingly sna europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant european headwinds continuing its progress now nine quarters in a row of yearoveryear growth and the profits rising even higher now up  straight quarters reflecting rci and snapon value creation new products and new processes positive trends in some difficult geographies also in ci our power tools division advanced in the period bolstered by an array of new products innovations like our cdr v lithium cordless drill launched in the quarter its our latest in the successful line of cordless tools an oversized variable speed trigger less finger stress and more accurate torque control a heavyduty gearbox reducing operating wobble and runout important for power tools a precision single sleeve keyless chuck with carbide jaw increasing grip and torque and enabling onehanded bit changes a nice time saver for professionals and all those features contained in a powerful but compact design with the cdr we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it now the industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter as we mentioned and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas that said weve maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries even during this turbulence we remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by snapon value creation especially in customer connection and innovation authoring new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges one of those new products designed for the natural resource sector is the snapon gas meter wrench custom engineered for a safer and more efficient service of gas meters rugged and lightweight with an aviationgrade aluminum body five interchangeable heads for maximum versatility and a inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required over  gas meters are replaced annually in new york city area alone and  to  of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service this innovative new snapon wrench was guided by customer connection direct observation of the work and it includes an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress and of course it incorporates our snapon flank drive wrenching system eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job its more versatile it ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches and its safer and more effective we believe the snapon gas meter wrench will be a big seller a musthave for service technicians throughout the power generation industry its just another example another example of customer connection and innovation strengthening the ci position in critical industries now on to the tools group an  rise in organic sales an encouraging increase again this quarter the operating earnings of  million represented a margin rate of  up  basis points from last year and that gain included a basis point impact from negative currency we speak quite a bit about the runways for coherent growth strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network the tools group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway you can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and for the full year and its evident in the health metrics we monitor each period whether its franchise profitability turnover or delinquencies the measures of franchise health are all trending upward and that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage the widening advantage of our band network in the robust vehicle repair arena but beyond the numbers theres qualitative but clearly observable evidence of forward momentum i can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter national franchise advisory council and more recently at the  kickoff events held earlier this month demonstrated the enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the tools group from route to route for some time now and theres more evidence we continue to be recognized as a franchise of choice again this year snapon ranked among the top  in entrepreneurs magazines list of top  franchises and the franchise business review which collects franchisee satisfaction feedback listed snapon as a top  franchise in its latest ranking marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award it also goes without saying that the tools groups performance would not have been possible without the benefits of snapon value creation particularly innovation and customer connection creating an assortment of exciting new products born from our unique customer interactions and for the sixth straight year the tools group increased this number of hit products million dollar sellers developed from that direct customer observation from our onsite experience in the workplace lets consider our new spbs series of striking prybars an upgrade in performance in durability and most importantly in safety these nextgeneration tools include a precision ground blade with angle design for maximum lift it also features a new grip material which performs in extremely low temperatures in important place like chicago today and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals and it features a new ergonomic handle that not only offers a more comfortable grip but the flared design provides technician hands greatly improved protection from offcenter hits not a small feature its an exceptional design made possible from customer connection and it represents progress even in a long established product line finally id be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if i didnt mention snapon credit financing the networks big ticket items and as you would expect the credit operation was well represented at our kickoff meetings – at our recent kickoff meetings held in the first part of the year and they were working to increase the power of credit and making our finance operations an even greater strategic contributor snapon is wielding its tools network more effectively every day and the support of our credit company is a major element in that progress moving to rsi sales in the fourth quarter were  million with organic gains of  reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers a low single digit increase to oem dealerships and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment operating earnings of  million rose  million and the oi margin it was  up  basis points from last years  with rci paving the way rci advanced in the quarter expanding with repair shop owners and managers but particularly with the independents mitchell  offers independent shops leading shop management software innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere and based on customer connection it has thousands of customer contexts every year mitchell  keeps improving its advantage adding repair information for new vehicles improving the ease of navigating its prodemand system building on the millions of actual repair events it already catalogs making its unique suretrack big data repair base even more powerful and customers shop owners and managers have taken notice the quarter saw more fleet placements more attention to industry shows like apec and more penetration of shops across the country from our diagnostics division also selling to independents another solid quarter including positive results from our newest handheld unit the verus edge i mentioned it last quarter it was in the midst of its introduction while the enthusiasm continued from our customers and from our franchisees its our most successful launch customer satisfaction is high and we regularly receive testimonials when i go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians we receive testimonials like the verus edge it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable verus edge is quite a product faster easier smarter technical service bulletins at hand comprehensive diagnostics and the power of suretrack big repair data simply the best handheld in vehicle repair and is another winner with independent shops its clear and speaking of diagnostics this time in the heavy truck area we continue to expand our coverage more engines more power train combinations the prolink ultra already the goto diagnostics in truck shops across the nation got stronger again finally in the period rsi equipment division recorded essentially flat activity impacted particularly by eastern europe that said we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops with innovative new products like the bp wheel balancer system designed for more sophisticated independent shops with specialty or a dealerlike operation a series of customer connection with those locations help us highlight the need for features like fast runout measurement automatic data entry via scanners and smart sonar a pinpoint laser light for positioning the adhesive weights on the wheel and a highly intuitive and rapid touch screen interface the b faster and more accurate its now available in european markets and the north american introduction is scheduled for later this year so thats rsi using snapon value creation authoring innovative new products capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers and thats our fourth quarter organic sales rising  eps  in the quarter up  against the  of unfavorable currency progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement driving a  operating margin  basis points higher than last year it was an encouraging quarter now ill turn the call over to aldo aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer thanks nick our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six net sales of  million in the quarter were up  organically reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair notably the snapon tools group as well as our diagnostics and repair information business partially offset by some headwinds in our ci segment on a reported basis net sales which included  million of unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased  million or  from  levels as you know snapon has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations largely due to the strengthening of the us dollar foreign currency movements adversely impacted our q sales comparisons by  basis points consolidated gross margin of  in the quarter improved  basis points primarily due to higher organic sales and savings from rci initiatives partially offset by  basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects operating expenses of  million yielded an operating expense margin of  in the quarter an improvement of  basis points from last year primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from rci initiatives as well as lower performancebased and stockbased compensation expenses no restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter we incurred  million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year as a result of these factors operating earnings before financial services of  million in the quarter including  million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased  as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales improved  basis points to  financial services revenues of  million in the quarter increased  from  levels and operating earnings of  million increased  these increases primarily

share increased  million or  per share from  levels representing a  increase in diluted earnings per share now lets turn to our segment results starting with the commercial  industrial or ci group on slide seven sales of  million in the quarter decreased  organically primarily due to a high single digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector these organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single digit gain in the segments europeanbased hand tools business and a double digit increase in the segments power tool operation gross profit in the ci group was  million in the quarter the gross margin of  increased  basis points as savings from rci initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations operating expenses of  million in the quarter compared to  million last year the operating expense margin of  improved  basis points primarily due to a basis point gain

increased  and the operating margin of  improved  basis points from  last year turning to the repair systems  information or rsi group shown on slide nine fourth quarter sales of  million increased  organically the organic sales increase primarily reflects a midsingle digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single

basis points from  last year operating expenses totaled  million in the quarter and the operating expense margin of  improved  basis points primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings

delinquency trends these continue to be in line with our expectations now turning to slide  cash provided by operations of  million in the quarter increased  million from comparable  levels due in

finance receivables capital expenditures of  million in the quarter compared with  million last year for the full year capital expenditures totaled  million turning to slide  days sales outstanding for trade receivables of  days compared with  days at  yearend inventories increased  million from  yearend levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions as well as the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of ecotechnics on a trailing month basis inventory turns of  turns compared with  turns at  yearend our yearend cash position of  million decreased  million from  yearend levels the net decrease include the impacts of funding  million of new finance receivables dividend payments of  million the repurchase of  shares for  million  million for capital expenditures and  million for the acquisition of ecotechnics these cash decreases were largely offset by  million of cash from collections of finance receivables and  million of cash from operations our net debt to capital ratio of  compared with  at  yearend in addition to our  million of cash and expected cash flow from operations we have more than  million in available credit facilities and our current shortterm credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets at  yearend we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding this concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance now briefly review a few outlook items for  we anticipate that capital expenditures in  will be in the range of  million to  million we also expect that our full year  effective income tax rate will be comparable to our  full year rate of  with that ill now turn the call over to nick for his closing thoughts nick nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer thanks aldo snapons fourth quarter an encouraging period taking advantage of tailwinds overcoming headwinds growing organically improving performance significantly again there is turbulence deep decreases in the military and oil and gas and difficulties across the geographies but there are tailwinds the aging and changing of vehicles continue so vehicle repair remains robust in this environment we keep driving down our strategic runways for growth launching innovative new products and advancing our position and despite the difficulties we continue moving down our runways for improvement snapon value creation safety and quality customer connection and innovation working better and better we had more new hit products in  than ever before not just for the tools group but for the corporation overall runways growth and improvement authored  organic growth in the quarter against the wind eps of  up  over last years fourth quarter against  of unfavorable currency and a  opco operating margin a rise of  basis points all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time and we believe that the strength of our business model the power of our brand and the capabilities of our team position us well to continue that positive trend as we go forward before i turn the call over to the operator ill say a word to our franchisees and associates i know many of you are hearing this call the encouraging results of our fourth quarter and the year and our potential for continuing the encouraging trends reflect your capability and your dedication for the success youve achieved for your contribution to our future and for your commitment to our team you have my congratulations you have my admiration and you have my thanks now ill turn the call over to the operator for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you well go first to tom hayes of northcoast research thomas hayes  northcoast research partners llc hey good morning gentlemen aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer good morning nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer good morning thomas hayes  northcoast research partners llc yes nick i was just wondering maybe you could talk a little bit more or provide a little bit more detail on the critical industries side certainly military and oil and gas has been kind of a challenge in the year maybe talk about the cadence as it went through that quarter and then the outlook for  nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer well i mean i think were seeing deep declines in both of those places were talking multiple double digit declines in the military again and oil and gas in particular if youre talking about the outlook weve set for some time that military – those two businesses are driving ci in general if you look at ci beyond those businesses it grew by about just over  so you see how much they influence the situation so you say to yourself well whats going to happen with those businesses and weve said for the military for a long time that its uncertain and so you say to yourself well that uncertainty is dependent on the government situation and so were poised to take advantage and it could come back in a shortterm or it could continue for a while in terms of oil and gas i think were seeing a historic downturn  decline in the business i mean in the oil price just in the last – in a recent time and we havent – we saw that at the big recession in  we saw at the iraniraq war so its kind of an unusual situation when that comes back i expect oil and gas to come back thomas hayes  northcoast research partners llc okay and maybe just a little bit nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer on the other hand as we said in our release and our comments aviation was pretty good for us in the quarter so you see some goesins and goesouts but the dominant factor in those businesses are the oil and gas and the military thomas hayes  northcoast research partners llc okay and then maybe just a question on the expense line the operating expense was down meaningfully how much of the decline was tied to – you called out less stockbased comp how much of that was contributed to the decline nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont know aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer lets say about  basis points nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yes  basis points the big thing if youre looking at operating expenses theres quite a few goesins and goesouts but a lot of that is rci but also if you step back last year in the fourth quarter we talked about the – there was a rd week but rd week in general if i looked at it from the trajectory of the corporation it was kind of not significant it wasnt significant it shouldnt change your view of where were going but if you start to look at it on account by account it of course becomes an issue associated with the operating expenses because you have that extra week of operating expenses you start to look at accounts you had an extra week of sales  extra sales but last year so that wouldnt be an issue but if you step back and look at it we dont think the rd week was significant in general or would change your view of the corporation but if you look at it on account like operating expense it really is a factor and you have currency in operating expense as well so you have those things rolling through rci currency and things like the special events of last year thomas hayes  northcoast research partners llc great thank you operator up next from longbow research we go to david macgregor david s macgregor  longbow research llc yes good morning nick good morning everyone nick can you just talk about demand patterns in january and any deterioration that may be visible beyond critical industries nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer we almost traditionally never talk about the current quarter we never give guidance but i will say look i will say that i was just on a van out here in addison itaska  and i have to say that when i talked to the people in the field both our franchisees and the customers – you get out of a van and you go from – you know this you go from shop to shops they all seemed very positive and that might stop with the positiveness and the optimism that i saw at the kickoff meetings we have a lot of these around the country and i was at one of them and the rest of our staff was at others and they come back and certainly were seeing a qualitative view of optimism and so i can offer that david s macgregor  longbow research llc okay is there – just within that sga pullback notwithstanding it was  basis points in the ci business i guess i get that but how much of that was just attributable to the weaker military and oil and gas business versus what may have been in that number in terms of structural cost takeouts and i guess also can you say to what extent there may have been some cost items that were pushed forward into q or pulled back into last quarters nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont think we did that i think – look i think if you look at – if youre talking about – are you talking about the  basis points of margin improvement in ci david s macgregor  longbow research llc i was talking about the  million of sga drop which was great but im just trying to get a sense of what the nature of that was nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer thats overall though the  million is overall david s macgregor  longbow research llc right nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer right thats not just for ci david s macgregor  longbow research llc correct nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer and that didnt have much push or pull whats in there is like i said you had currency a big number of currency with the currency yearoveryear affects that sga and shrinks it you have rci youve got – as somebody mentioned before you have some goesins and goesouts in terms of pension going the other way compensation going one way and you also have the rd week last year which was an extra week of operating expenses like i said – and so therefore the comparison issue isnt favorable you get paid back at the sales line for that because the sales ends up being a little bit smaller but if you look at it – i dont want to – i want to focus that if you look at that one account you start to see the effect of the rd week if you look at it in total it wasnt much of an effect for us david s macgregor  longbow research llc okay last question just if you could talk about the trends youre seeing in tool storage and whether youre seeing a deceleration in demand patterns nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer no no our big ticket items in total we never talk particularly about tool storage but our big ticket items in total were up a little bit more than the tools did  in the quarter and i dont see that really i really dont see it we havent identified any particular cooling of that activity now from quartertoquarter these things always change but i dont see as a downturn like i said our big ticket items continued david s macgregor  longbow research llc great thanks very much nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator well go next to liam burke of wunderlich liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc thank you good morning nick good morning aldo nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer hey liam aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer good morning liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc nick can you give us a sense – you had a good year in new product introductions and hit products what can we look forward i mean are you continuing to see growth in that area with more new introductions to create more hit products nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yes i am but look i hate to pin myself to the rack of continual increases in milliondollar hit products im trying not to do that but thats our drive i can tell you this were getting better and better at customer connection and innovation and if you think about it a complex product line  plus skus is asymmetrically  enabled by new technology like d printing and finite element analysis and some of the other things like xray diffractometers which is new to us and electron microscopes and so on so from a design point of view were getting better so we dont have to put as much upfront into every product and from a callingtheairstrikes point of view in other words reacting to customer connection were getting better and that has authored the continual improvement of our hit products this year it was up again i would be aiming to bring it up next year but were not – its not something we always report about but i think every year our new products become more impactful and more effective i mean just look at the verus edge the verus edge is simply the best product available in diagnostics and diagnostics is a rising category its faster smarter easier to use and it gives you handheld access to our unique millions of records in – database of millions of records that allows technicians to shortcut the repair process this is revolutionary and thats just one thing we pointed out the prybar today in our – now we use the prybar for a reason the prybar is just – its a prybar yet customer connection and innovation showed us how to make that longstanding category so much better thats whats happening in snapon thats whats driving the business for us and it works in the tools group and were confident its going to work for critical industries although theres turbulence as you can see in critical industries with oil and gas i mean oil and gas i think we – oil and gas and military we never – we always said that our penetration was low and we wouldnt see an impact but we didnt contemplate going from  oil to  oil which is cataclysmic liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc okay and with the end markets in the automotive repair continuing to grow are you seeing any change in the competitive front nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont think so i listen to the same publicity that you would listen to and so people are – i think its a robust market so theres room for everybody to have some kind of good news in this market but when i go out – and i checked this the other day with our people when i go out to the franchisees around the vans they dont talk about the competitors they talk about our business and how we can make it better so i dont think were seeing any kind of change at present i rode on a van where the guy talks about the numbers of competitors that left his route in other words gave up the business and went out he keeps track of it but thats all i mean he doesnt worry about the competition he worries about himself he worries about well okay our – things like questions like our power tool is actually a lot better than our old power tool the one i replaced or maybe it isnt as good we need to make it a little bit better those are the kinds of things we talk about or how much our productivity advancements like providing – for the vans providing a mobile tablet for van drivers a couple of mobile tablets for a van  of our van drivers have assistance and the mobile tablet allows them to spread both the principal and the assistant out into different areas greatly increasing their reach they talk about that and the efficacy of that they dont talk about the competitors liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc great thank you nick nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator from barrington research well go to gary prestopino gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc hey good morning everyone nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer hi gary gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc couple of questions here i know somebody asked this about milliondollar products but nick could you maybe quantify what was the growth in millionplus products that you put out this year versus last year nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer im not going to actually quantify ive tried to avoid quantifying that and im not going to change that in this call but i would say it was up this year by a reasonable margin in fact you might even call it a substantial margin in terms of what was launched so we had a pretty good year in terms of new products and remember what i have said is that the number is now five times or six times what it was in  thats a pretty aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer good number nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer pretty good increase gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc thats helpful and you would anticipate that obviously youre going to continue to try and strive to put out more new products especially  nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure the whole point is yes im probably not going to slit my wrists if it doesnt increase as much next year you know what i mean but certainly we do target that and thats part of our plan we would expect that to happen we put the capabilities and the elements in place to make that happen and were getting – its simply gary were getting better at it were getting better at it you can see it in the tools group numbers gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc right nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer you know okay  against  or  gdps gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc right can you maybe – weve – at least we think that youve had a recovery here for  were going into year seven especially in the us and the automotive market is there anything different that youre experiencing in this recovery versus maybe prior recoveries in your experience with snapon nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer actually no i dont think so actually the recovery has been going on since  and so i dont think so i do think automotive repair which is  of our business – plus of our business  is relatively robust determined by the aging of the vehicles and the changing of the vehicles which isnt interrupted so much by economics and so i think automotive repair is in a good place and makes us resistant to these – not immune to these kinds of changes but resistant i dont see any change there look i think if you look at other geographies and industries they go up and down like you see in oil and gas and in military like in anybody else but i dont see anything different about those that i havent seen in a number of different ups and downs except that maybe the oil and gas  gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc hello oh jesus operator please stand by while we reconnect with our speakers one moment once again ladies and gentlemen please stay on the line music  –  please stand by as the speakers are joining give us just one moment and you have rejoined please continue nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer hello gary are you still there operator yes gary your line is open nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yes sorry what did you hear last sorry we got cut off here i guess gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc no that was fine i think we were talking about just maybe differences in the recovery what youre seeing nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yes i dont think that much i mean this is just – i mean certainly oil and gas is a bigger downturn than anybodys seen in a while its unusual right but other than that i dont think so this isnt our first rodeo so weve seen it and automotive repair seems to be chunking along i think gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay and then one last nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer doing pretty well sure gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc thats good to hear one last question for aldo in terms of your international sales they run what about  of your business right somewhere around there aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer yes thats a – i think you have europe is about  of the mix and emerging markets add another  gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc thats what im getting at in terms of currencies the currencies that really impact you would probably be the pound the euro and then what else aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer you have it pretty much right if youre looking at the sales line gary the most important currency that creates a headwind is the euro in addition to the euro you have the canadian dollar lot of people forget about that but the canadian dollar the british pound would be the next most significant ones when it comes to the bottom line we have more natural hedges throughout the continent of europe so the euro actually has less of an impact on the bottom line the biggest impact to our profitability is actually the canadian dollar the british pound gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay so the canadian dollar and the pound are on  aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer gee thats why you see most of the impact manifesting itself in the tools group if you think about the tools group is largely a sales footprint so they dont have a lot of cost that enjoy the benefit of the haircut in the weaker currencies in the united kingdom and in canada or australia for that matter so they dont enjoy the protection that you get where you have a eurobased organization theres a lot more cost that decrease in us dollar terms nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yes the tools group was up  – was up  basis points but that was against  basis points of negative currency so you can see where that affects okay gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay thanks a lot guys aldo j pagliari  senior vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer sure operator well go next to david leiker robert w baird joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker hi good morning this is joe vruwink in for david unknown speaker hi joe joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker the one slice of ci that i dont believe you commented on yet was asia any updates on growth rates or trends from the asia pacific region nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer it was mixed in the quarter china was weaker than weve seen in a while and so we had china being weak and we had some – whereas indonesia had been weak before indonesia was up india was up so we kind of had a balance there in terms of our mix in asia pacific china being more difficult in this quarter we see a lot of variation from quartertoquarter in asia pacific joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker and in china is it possible to determine – this will sound strange but if a slowdown in new vehicle demand which may actually cause the fleet to age a bit ultimately ends up being more beneficial to snapon nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont know i dont think so i mean i kind of think the cars that are there in the park theyre going to age anyway i dont think that the cars or the new cars that are being purchased are making the old cars go away thats what i think i dont think theyre shipping those overseas to any big extent now i could be wrong about that but thats our general impression about china its a lot of different markets and a lot of different areas i think the slowdown would probably help some but i dont think it would be as big a factor as you might think its usually the size of the park joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker and then one last one on ci is there any correlation in the military business for snapon to the wheeled vehicle programs getting rolled out so if jltv production starts ramping at oshkosh does snapon typically see a benefit in their defense business nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer well i dont know if weve tied to particularly oshkosh or something like that but certainly wheeling out of new programs help us a lot for example the f is a help to us the fighter vehicle the fighter because we have a lot of the business associated with supporting that for both production and for repair so that kind of program is an underlying program but across the programs in the defense department particularly around the projects around with those new products that business is very weak – was very weak this quarter if they launch new products like you say a wheeled vehicle product at oshkosh that provides an opportunity and were wellpositioned to take advantage of that so those kinds of programs new vehicles do help us but i dont know joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker and so nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer i dont know if you can just trace it to an oshkosh program joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker no no i was thinking more broadly on the programs that you commented on and so is it maybe fair to say the duration of this pullback in military spending might be shorter than whats snapon dealt with in   around the sequester nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yes gee i dont know i think the government business is kind of uncertain weve said the military business was up in the quarter – up in the first two quarters and we said we knew it was going to be uncertain and now when its down i still say the same thing certainly the things youre talking about new programs are going to help and would shorten the cycle thats true stabilization of the budget would help it may be not as chronic as the controller of the prior cycle but i cant really say for sure joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc broker okay i will leave it there thank you nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator from jefferies well hear from bret jordan david l kelley  jefferies llc good morning this is actually david kelley in for bret this morning thanks for taking my questions a couple of quick followups on rsi here and i guess first regarding the flat undercar sales you mentioned i know us service chain reported a fourth quarter comp decline and largely due to some mild winter weather conditions along the east coast just wondering if you saw some weatherrelated headwinds in the quarter and i guess how was domestic undercar performance and how do we think about that segment going forward given the robust auto repair market were talking about and really some of the significant miles driven gains weve seen over the last three months nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer yes look theres a lot of goesins and goesouts in the undercar equipment business first and foremost that flatness is impacted by eastern europe among all our businesses the undercar equipment business had the strongest position in eastern europe and russia so the dips in those places impacted that business as just squeezed down to a smaller place the most thats number one in terms of the other businesses of course weather can be a factor in undercar and that might have been – say it might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and some of that bad weather and then the other thing is it was up quite – our undercar business is a longer wave business it isnt just a quarter business when we have a good quarter like we had in the third quarter sometimes youll have resources devoted to installation of those new products flowing into the next quarter which will put a weight on the next quarter so you see those three things rolling through it i would expect – to your question about the longerterm i expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust vehicle repair market in the us and in europe as the cars get older and by the way as the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy the precision of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger so were very positive about the longterm future of that business and we have a major share of it david l kelley  jefferies llc all right great i appreciate the color and then just quickly if you can provide some maybe color around the  basis points margin expansion for rsi just wondering how much of that is basic blocking and tackling around these rci initiatives that continue to provide you guys tailwinds here nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer well rci is a big dollop of it and then of the  basis points i would say youve got a little bit of negative currency and you got about  basis points or so what i would call favorable mix as you follow us over time you will see that rsi has quite a variation from business to business in terms of operating margin it could be thousands of basis points and so what happened in this quarter is we had another strong quarter of diagnostics and mitchell the business to independents which are high margin business and a reduction of the hardware business which is equipment so that generated that  basis points or so of help from business mix so thats what youre seeing rci and business mix david l kelley  jefferies llc all right great thank you and then just a final one from me and this is more kind of a big picture thought question here youre mentioning sales to oem dealerships were up again single digits and i guess as we think about maybe being on the back end of a cyclical recovery in new vehicle sales do you think there might be a shift in dealership ordering patterns of equipment either theyre focusing more on parts than service retention or maybe theyre spending less due to a flat retail sales market how do you think about the dealership channel over the next nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer im not sure having worked in the auto industry for  years myself i would say thats a hard call i mean i dont think you can make a lot out of this i guess we were saying midsingle digits or low single digits in the oem dealership business this quarter but i dont think you can make a conclusion on one quarter some of that got driven by programs out of oem manufacturers the essential diagnostics and so on i do think you make a point that as new car sales attenuate dealerships tend to focus a little bit more on parts and service i think that is true to the extent that the time constants on which that rolls into our business im not sure david l kelley  jefferies llc all right great thanks for taking my question nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator david macgregor of longbow research has a followup question please go ahead david s macgregor  longbow research llc yes just a followup nick somewhere within your portfolio theres got to be a line of business or a product or some franchise that serves as a pretty reliable leading indicator for you and im just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where youre seeing leading indicators in your business and basically what theyre telling you theres obviously some concerns here about your ability to sustain growth in  i just wanted to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit about why youre feeling confident to – certainly in the first half of  nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer well our leading indicators are pretty much what we hear from our franchisees and what we see about the programs in terms of the changing of the vehicles and what we hear from our franchisees about their outlooks for the demand in their businesses you can go out and talk to them and the leading indicators are gee are we providing the kinds of tools that would solve the new problems that are coming on the horizons in the independent garages now this isnt a quantitative leading indicator but its been pretty reliable for us and so what we see is the optimism coming out from them saying boy i think things are good and the fact that we our new product portfolios our innovative new products are solving more problems than ever those are the kinds of things and that hasnt abated so i feel pretty good about that business and in terms of the other businesses i just think we also feel good about our growing strength in the critical industries its just that you see some very big headwinds in some of those critical industries and i cant predict where those are going to go david s macgregor  longbow research llc can you just remind us again what nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer on the other hand i will just offer that weve seen up and down before and weve been able to grow profitability against the winds not every quarter necessarily but in terms of a trend we view our situation as a trend if you go back and you look at our numbers from  onwards sales and profits the trend continued and even through the recession and the dip in the recession that trend continued david s macgregor  longbow research llc so you continue to see growth in your futuredated orders nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer we dont have futuredated orders really were not a futuredated order business so we dont have much of an order backlog david s macgregor  longbow research llc yes nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer we dont have that kind of thing we have to rely on the kinds of things ive talked about david s macgregor  longbow research llc all right okay and just last question can you just remind us what critical industries represents as a percentage of total ci nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer it represents about id say  david you can say given for government worth its  million business roughly right david s macgregor  longbow research llc right right nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer okay david s macgregor  longbow research llc thanks nick nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer sure operator and our final question today will come from richard hilgert of morningstar richard hilgert  morningstar research congratulations on a great quarter guys nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer thanks richard richard hilgert  morningstar research just wanted to get your feel for what youre seeing in terms of puts and takes with some of the issues that were facing right now on the new car side of the business were seeing diesel being a big issue right now were seeing hybrids being a big issue were seeing active safety coming into play over the next couple of years i would imagine that with more and more electronic control theres going to be more opportunities for diagnostics maybe but also im wondering on the tools side if theres any opportunities there whats some of the puts and takes that youre seeing with all these changes coming down the pike nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer actually richard all of those things are positive for our business when the vehicles change that requires new tool loads new electronics new undercar equipment to deal with the changes if you just take one and if you think about selfdriving vehicles and things like that i mean the more people rely on internal mechanisms inside the car the more precise calibration has to be and therefore the more careful and more detailed the mechanical job is the mechanics have to be and so if it gets more electronic theres opportunities for diagnostics if it gets more attended to onboard computers to control the car more equipment and more diagnostics and ironically during the time in which the cars have electrified its gone from – in the s it went from   engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine codes in that time demand for hand tools has only increased because the reparability of the car is so far down in terms of the design considerations that the cars have become more and more difficult to physically repair let alone diagnose associated with electronics so all of those things are good for us we see a very positive future and trend and were confident that continues the trend that you see in our numbers if you look at our numbers and you see over periods of time sales and oi margin continual trends in good times and challenged times richard hilgert  morningstar research great thank you very much nicholas t pinchuk  chairman  chief executive officer
