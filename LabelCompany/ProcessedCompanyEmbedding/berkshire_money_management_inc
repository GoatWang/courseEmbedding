personally grateful for the opportunity to share our financial knowledge to help make people’s lives better about berkshire money management in  berkshire money management bmm set up offices in pittsfield ma the firm grew quietly at least “quietly” outside the office walls but within the walls bmm was making a lot of noise growing its financial newsletter the navigator to upwards of  subscribers bmm’s investment management business grew as subscribers asked us to begin managing their investment portfolios the firm grew rapidly and in  bmm sold the newsletter business and for a few years closed the door to new clients in  in anticipation of the financial crisis we took action we began shorting the market ie made investments that could profit if the stock market fell while protecting our client’s money through defensive investments as a result there was a huge response from our current clients asking us if we would manage more of their money and the money of their friends and relatives in  we came to realize that there was a tremendous demand for investment managers who adjusted portfolios to reflect changing client needs and goals so we hired more people and opened our doors to new clients bmm gravitates away from the traditional agebased assetallocation recommendations of the financial industry ex “ minus your age equals the amount of equities you should own…” and we also gravitate away from the traditional theories of longterm investing ex “the stock market will always come back…” and diversification “own a little bit of everything but not too much…” first while age is important it is not the main factor while time is a leading risk measurement the marketplace better defines what is or what is not risky for example some might think that owning a shortterm treasurybond fund is “safe” or “conservative” – that is until the fed raises rates and the fund loses money second while bmm accepts the premise of longterm investing we believe that we add value to your portfolio by identifying potential market corrections and by making the necessary adjustments third while diversification is of the utmost importance there is no need to own something just for the sake of following an industry mantra of owning a little bit of everything why own something that is losing money and why not own more of something that is going up most importantly we apply our investment philosophies in a manner to accomplish your goals  at berkshire money management we’re not just investing for you we are investing for something for what you want to accomplish  the end result is a portfolio strategy that has led to longterm relationships with valued clients and at the same time reduced risk we invite you to explore this website to learn more and if you have

money management skip to content berkshire money management menu estate planning most people understand they should get tax advice and align legal structures to prepare assets for their heirs we go a step beyond and begin preparing your heirs for your assets estate planning part part  – legal issuespart  – health care prepare your heirs many families hire legal counsel to prepare the relevant documents and leave it at that often this isn’t enough and what remains is a major communication gap it has not been uncommon for families who “believed” they were wellprepared to find that they were not it isn’t always the documents and it isn’t always financial often times there are emotional connections that become more important than a monetarily equitable distribution of assets preparing heirs is a function of the estate planning process no matter how large or how modest everyone has an estate and wants to control how it is given to the people and organizations they care most about to ensure that your wishes and legacy are carried out you need to provide specific instructions stating whom you want to receive what and when in detail this ensures that the least amount is paid in taxes legal fees and court costs and also helps to avoid family interpretations of what is equitable and intended we are here and experienced in helping you connect your intentions with your other

the fear of missing out or fomo has supported the stock market averages this week although it appeared that the indexes simply marked time appearances can be deceiving   we made new record highs again

berkshire money management skip to content berkshire money management menu research  advice bmm articles  march  april   don’t flinch by bmm march   surprise ·         the heightened level of analyst optimism felt at the beginning of the year has proved to not be warranted ·         corporate earnings have disappointed this quarter ·         the direction of the us dollar was predicted but the pace of the ascent has been surprising click here to view pdf version the economic news this year hasn’t been that good but the stock market absorbed it with two tiny corrections five percent in january and three percent in march  the citi economic surprise index esi which essentially tracks expected economic numbers versus actual numbers keeps on showing us that the heightened level of analyst optimism felt at the beginning of the year was not warranted the esi recently reached its lowest level since july  we’re not too surprised at some of the surprises for example in our  economic outlook we wrote “bmm has found that analysts are not very good at predicting earnings per share but we are confident in our ability of figuring out how much consensus estimates will move… consensus estimates for sp  operating eps growth will grow from around  in  to  in …but we think that eps growth will probably be in the loweight’s to highnine’s for ”  so that earnings have been disappointing this quarter wasn’t news to us the good news is the potential for new upside surprises in regards to earnings  a calculation called the “guidance spread” measures the difference between the percentage of companies raising guidance and lowering guidance the spread for the most recent quarter has come in at its lowest since the final two quarters of  at the end of the financial crisis  admittedly we may be relying as much on hope as we are on data but the proverbial bar has now been set low enough for actual corporate earnings to begin hurdling over expectations in a quarter or two what was news to us was the pace of the dollar’s increase  in our  economic outlook we argued that “with much of the developed nation in an easing policy a normalization of us interest rates should continue to drive the us dollar higher due to interest rate divergences”  so the direction was obvious to us  the magnitude and pace however was outside of the range of any forecast we saw or considered  the strengthening dollar can be a blessing and it can be a curse  on the plusside a stronger dollar pushes down the price of oil and other commodities helps keep inflation in check and improves terms of international trade  on the minusside us corporate profit margins could be squeezed as they cut the price of their products abroad that list could get a lot longer for both pluses and minuses but they are also technical and we’ll spare you from that here the point is that arguments can be made for the desire of either a strong or a weak dollar however our analysis indicates that it is not only the value of the us dollar that matters for growth but also the pace of appreciation  against major currencies the dollar value has increased over thirteen percent over the past six months the most since february  historically such fast increases have been associated with belowtrend economic growth the bulk of the negative impact comes from exportoriented manufacturing which has actually contracted in the past when the dollar has appreciated so quickly the dollar’s strength comes from growth and interest rate differentials between the us and the rest of the world  given that we don’t expect those differences to abate we expect the strength to continue the strength of the us dollar will weigh on net exports this quarter  since  there have been eleven cases of the dollar appreciating by at least five percent over six months  on average net exports were not a big subtraction from gdp growth in the first two quarters but increasingly subtracted from growth in the third to sixth quarters    no recession means only shortduration corrections •             job gains span almost industries regions and pay scales •             neither households nor businesses are overleveraged •             the banking system is strong so far this year the price of oil has sunk earnings have disappointed the dollar has rocketed and it seems like the fed may raise interest rates sometime this year  in isolation any of these events could cause problems for the stock market  but they are not occurring in isolation – they’re all happening at the same time all while valuations could be argued as stretched not lofty but stretched and optimism has been increasing often a contrary indicator  given all of this as a backdrop the risks of the biggest correction since  seem more than plausible but don’t flinch – the market remains far from the bubble conditions that could be expected at the end of a secular ie longterm bull run  any correction that occurs – whether it is big or small – will only prove to be a cyclical occurrence that will reset valuations and ultimately refresh the secular bull  following the advice of “don’t flinch” will be hard for any of us if a stock market drop of any meaningful magnitude does occur that’s not a commentary on the next correction it’s a comment regarding any and all corrections and the human reaction  a drop in stock market prices often triggers an emotional response and that response is panic in the form of selling  but the more appropriate reaction might be to switch from bonds to stocks or to be more nuanced from one asset class or sector of stocks to another the point is that any pullback should be shortlived  like the fivepercent pullback in january and all the other pullbacks since march  the next correction of any magnitude will likely be forgotten merely months after an eventual bottom  corrections in nonrecessionary times happen in the matter of months often too quick to make a meaningful defensive change to a portfolio and typically bounce back in a time period that mirrors about twice the duration of the decline so not that long  however during a recession market declines grind on much longer and also take a lot more time to recover in price  a recession would make us flinch  but don’t flinch because we just can’t make the case for a recession at six years the current us economic expansion is already longer than the average expansion since world war ii and is yet to show signs of deterioration  in fact the likelihood is that this will be one of the longer economic expansions in history  the breadth of job growth is rarely ever as strong aside from the energy sector job gains are occurring in all industries regions and pay scales  but as robust as hiring has been the labor market still has slack  that slack is good news for now as expansions typically end when the economy overheats ie the labor market is at full employment and businesses are running beyond capacity inflation pressures develop and interest rates become high thus exposing overleveraged households and businesses  this expansion is far from that this expansion has room to run core inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi is rather flat and not likely to pick up given the drop in oil prices and the rising dollar  and although the fed will likely raise interest rates this year it is seen as more a process of “normalization” and it will be a long time before rates get back to anything looking familiar  not to mention that weakness in europe’s economy and their responding version of quantitative easing will pressure down us interest rates also there is no indication of households or businesses being overleveraged  households owe about  trillion less today or almost  less than they did at the peak of their indebtedness in   less debt combined with lower interest rates has significantly reduced household debt service burdens  in fact the share of disposable income that households must pay to make debt payments is as low as it has been since the federal reserve started tracking that measure in  as you would suspect as a result delinquency rates on household debts are about as low as they get in the best of economic times which in turn helps keep businesses flush with cash  now it is important to note that households are still borrowing and still spending which is important to keep the economy moving  but the borrowing is more cautious than it was prior to the great recession – for example auto and student lending is strong but credit card and home equity lending is softer  and corporate profitability has never been stronger and businesses’ capacity to service their debts is excellent  the quick ratio the ratio of liquid assets to shortterm liabilities is almost fifty percent about double its longterm average  and the interest coverage ratio the ratio of interest payments to corporate cash flow is still falling even though it’s already near record lows businesses are borrowing more aggressively than households and that’s a good sign  corporate bond issuance has been robust and commercial  industrial c  i lending by banks is expanding at a doubledigit pace  c  i lending is among the most reliable lagging indicators and while we obviously prefer leading indicators that amount of lending is proof that the economic expansion is solid bottom line  the pace and ascent of the us dollar’s rise is not something to disregard  an argument can be made for the desire of either a strong or a weak dollar however our analysis indicates that it is not only the value of the us dollar that matters for growth but also the pace of appreciation  historically such fast increases have been associated with belowtrend economic growth the bulk of the negative impact comes from exportoriented manufacturing which has actually contracted in the past when the dollar has appreciated so quickly for quite some time largecap stocks have been favored over small and midcapitalization stocks  this may be the trigger for some reallocation from largecaps to something a bit smaller so far this year the price of oil has sunk earnings have disappointed the dollar has rocketed and it seems like the fed may raise interest rates sometime this year  in isolation any of these events could cause problems for the stock market  but they are not occurring in isolation – they’re all happening at the same time all while valuations could be argued as stretched not lofty but stretched and optimism has been increasing often a contrary indicator  given all of this as a backdrop the risks of the biggest correction since  seem more than plausible  but given the likelihood of a continued us economic expansion any correction – no matter the size – should play out in the matter of a few months and be the proverbial pause that refreshes before the stock market continues its path of a secular bull market  given that when said correction does occur the appropriate reaction might be to switch from bonds to stocks or to be more nuanced from one asset class or sector of stocks to another     free retirement guide more articles all you need to know about medicare

to take the extra mile — berkshire money management skip to content berkshire money management menu the extra mile scott c little vice president i really do know my customers last thanksgiving a client emailed me asking to transfer funds to another account of hers—electronically but we can’t do that by email so i let her know i’d need to call her we verify some personal information but she’s in some kind of train or subway station and it’s too loud she says she’ll call me back but something in her voice sounded “off” to me so when i hang up—i call her work number and she’s there it wasn’t her i explain that someone has her information is trying to get into her accounts—walk her through who to call and what to do to protect herself right now and then i wait to see if the other woman will call me back—as she said she would she does and caller id not only shows my client’s cell phone number—but somehow she gives me all the information needed to make an electronic transfer—and more enough in fact that someone at a large financial firm could have easily and legitimately transferred her money my client would have been devastated but because i knew her well enough to recognize her voice it didn’t work i was so relieved that i stopped this from ruining her holiday season zack marcotte trust me i do this every day a client told me he had recently changed jobs and asked if i would roll over his k—into an existing roth account i asked if he knew whether his original k had been a traditional or a roth was he sure he was a little gruff at my complicating something so simple but i really encouraged him to call his k company and verify it first because i suspected it was most likely a traditional k—which would have rather large tax ramifications for him that he wasn’t considering wouldn’t you know it he called me—on my day off—he was obviously grateful that i had stopped him and asked the right questions it had indeed been a traditional k and i had just saved him a costly mistake i came into work and opened a traditional ira for him right then it was worth an afternoon of vacation time to garner that kind of appreciation bill schmick that’s why it’s called customer care a family client of mine led by an year old widow and grandmother gave me an opportunity to really reach out beyond just business over time i grew to know the family and this lady rather well and had come to appreciate our conversations as her health had been failing we’d naturally talked about her financial situation and plans but i also just checked in regularly—just to catch up over time she became housebound with limited mobility under hour nursing care one day she mentioned that being cooped up all day wasn’t so bad but she did miss playing her opera and classical music dvds apparently her caregiver wasn’t a fan and she just couldn’t manage loading or pressing the buttons by herself any longer when i hung up the phone i ordered alexa then i called her daughter knowing that her husband a computer guy would be able to hook it up in his motherlaw’s room this would allow her to listen to whatever she wanted whenever she wanted by voice command she called me in

are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by

budgeting refers to the process of determining how you are going to spend your money using software like quicken can help you track your spending so you can make sure youre on target for your financial goals and if you fall behind you can make changes to your budget and readjust your spending habits budgeting is a guide your budget for any particular time period is a guide for how you want to spend your money so that you can achieve your financial goals  both in the shortterm and the longterm when you set up a budget you can see where your money could go and then you get to decide in advance which options are most important for you for example if you dont have a budget that snazzy new outfit or topoftheline grill might catch your attention in the store and get you to buy it even though you should be putting your money elsewhere however if you have a budget and you know you want to prioritize saving for a new car or a house down payment you can turn down impulse purchases because you know the money is already earmarked for something more important gathering necessary information to make a budget you need to know your income and your expenses income includes not only your paycheck but also any other money you receive such as rent from a rental property or interest on a bank account your expenses include anything you spend money on such as housing food clothing insurance entertainment and travel to make an accurate budget it helps to have several months worth of your past spending documented so you can make realistic predictions about how much you spend in each category if you havent tracked your spending in the past just use your best estimate and adjust it as needed as you get more information budgets are for everyone budgeting is something that everyone regardless of income or net worth can benefit from no matter how much money you make you can always go bankrupt if you spend more than you bring in however budgets are also very personal in that you decide which goals are most important to you for example one person might put a high value on driving an expensive car and be willing to work an extra job or cut back on other expenses to have one while another person might be content to drive a used car into the ground to save up for a special vacation budgeting is a process as much as some people might prefer to set their budget and forget about it good financial planning requires you to reevaluate your spending over time and adjust your budget accordingly for example if you change jobs so that your commute is shorter each day you may be able to reduce the amount you have budgeted for gas costs and increase your retirement savings or if the cost of food goes up you may have to cut back on the amount of times you eat out

logo united statescanada cart sign inmy account investment portfolio you are here what is money management money management refers to how you handle all aspects of your finances from making a budget for where each paycheck goes to setting longterm goals to picking investments that will help you to reach those goals money management is not just about saying no to any purchase but developing a plan that allows you to say yes to the things that are most important to you any amount of money can prove to be too little if you dont have good money management skills knowing where youre at the start of good money management requires you to know where youre at in terms of assets things you own and liabilities amounts you owe your assets include your bank accounts investment accounts retirement accounts and property like your house and car your liabilities include your credit card balances student loans car loans mortgages and other debts when you subtract your assets from your liabilities you get your net worth if your liabilities are more than your assets your net worth is negative but with good money management you can change that setting your goals your goals dictate how you manage your money its easy to overlook your longterm goals in favor of just trying to figure out which bills get paid today however by setting goals you can give clarity to which expenses are necessary and which ones you can cut out there isnt a universal right and wrong when it comes to your spending goals but it takes effort to attain them if its your dream to have a car that costs  you have to make more spending cuts than someone who only wants to spend  on a car creating and adjusting your budget creating a budget helps you stay on top of managing your money because you earmark certain amounts for certain expenses for example you might limit yourself to  for entertainment each month after accounting for other basic necessities and debt payments however your budget can be a moving target over time if you realize you can buy groceries on sale and save  a month you might increase your entertainment budget to  and add  to your savings budget alternatively if you get a pay raise budget that raise into your savings rather than adding it to discretionary spending amounts managing multiple accounts as you save for different goals you will likely have money in multiple accounts for example you might keep your emergency fund in a separate savings account so you arent tempted to tap it for an impulse purchase also you can use an ira or k plan to keep your retirement nest egg separate from your other money youll also use different strategies for goals with different time horizons you might be able to be more aggressive investing in stocks and bonds with funds in your retirement account if you wont need the money for  years on the other hand you will want an account with out any risk such as a savings account for your emergency fund because you could need that money at any time a software program such as quicken can help you keep track of your various accounts to make sure youre staying on track with your spending and savings goals did this article help you

investment portfolio you are here what is retirement planning retirement planning is the process of setting goals for your retirement years and then creating a plan to fulfill those goals executing a retirement plan requires most people to put aside some of their current income for longterm savings and investment you can use taxsheltered vehicles such as traditional individual retirement accounts iras and employer pension plans to fund part of your retirement plan with pretax dollars living and working longer early in the process youll want to decide at what age youd like to retire it might be a rough estimate at this point subject to change as the years roll by many people today are living and working longer than those in previous generations the centers for disease control and prevention reported in  that the us populations average life expectancy rose to a record high of  years gallup polls show that in  the average american expects to retire at age  up from the  figure of age  actual retirement ages have also crept up during this period from  to  years of age setting goals youll need to make an educated guess about the percentage of your preretirement annual income to save for your postretirement years a figure known as the replacement rate a  research paper from morningstar investment management indicated that the usual replacement rate of  to  percent may be too high by as much as  percent your individual replacement rate depends on several factors including your earning power while working and your desired lifestyle after retirement lifetime planning armed with estimates of your retirement age and your replacement ratio you can start formulating a longterm plan that shows how much youll have to set aside each year to meet your retirement goals quickens lifetime planner tool helps you determine the size of your retirement nest egg and the amount you can withdraw each year so that the money lasts through your expected lifetime you can include other sources of retirement income such as social security and company pensions quicken lifetime planner provides longterm planning facilities that can help you organize the information in an easytounderstand format and track progress toward your goals explore your options you might want to explore different options when setting up your retirememt plan you can work out variations of your plan in which you change your income estimates the amount you save and invest each year your expected rate of return on your investments your retirement age or other factors for example you can experiment with the age at which you start receiving social security payments youre eligible for these payments at age  but the longer you postpone these the more youll eventually get each month you get the maximum payment if you wait until age  to begin drawing your social security payments another option is retiring in stages gradually shifting from fulltime employment to parttime work that you can do at home such as writing or consulting you might also need to adjust your assumptions about your postretirement lifestyle did this article help you yes it did no it didntim not sure why was this
