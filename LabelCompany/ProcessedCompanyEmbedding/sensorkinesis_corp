its position in the medical technology arena but also to the potential end beneficiary of its product solution we started with a logo design and the development of a style guide that would reflect a contemporary hightechnology company feel while using a color pallet associated with the patient care and healing the stylized “o” was developed to represent the company’s core technology of being able to pull in and contain pathogen samples for disease detection analysis from there we created a variety of communication tools including a corporate website printed and digital brochures as well as video and event services for the company’s growing communication needs creative services include website design logo design corporate brochure photography video live event services “idg consistently
