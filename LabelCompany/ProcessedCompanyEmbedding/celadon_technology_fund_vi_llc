where we currently have limited access due to financing constraints participate in the economics of the lease stream and residual value of the tractors and improve our return on invested capital compared with retaining the portfolio on the balance sheet  we look forward to accelerating the growth of our quality companies business unit with our new capital partner quality companies business will continued  over the past two fiscal years our quality companies unit has grown tractors under management to approximately  on june   from approximately  on june    substantially all of these tractors have been purchased by us on favorable terms through our consolidated buying power  the tractors are then sold to a third party financing company who then leases them to independent contractors who provide capacity to us and other trucking companies under the historical servicing arrangement with our financial partner quality companies provides driver recruiting lease payment remittance insurance maintenance and other services for a fee  celadon is not a guarantor of such financing or the leases and we do not share in the profit or loss from the lease revenue stream or the residual value of the tractor assets the assets and debt associated with these tractors are not included in our consolidated balance sheets  in addition quality currently has approximately  tractors on order from several different manufacturers scheduled to be delivered over the next three years we have identified the growth of quality companies as a strategic priority for several reasons  first we believe the market for tractors under management is growing faster than the general truckload freight market  second our consolidated buying power warranty plans maintenance experience and insurance expertise should provide a differentiated services suite to independent contractors and thirdparty fleets that may not have the capacity or desire to build these skill sets internally  third the quality companies business to the extent pursued offbalance sheet with financial partners has the prospect for more consistent margins lower capital expenditures and higher return on invested capital than our traditional truckload business  fourth we believe we are able to access an entrepreneurial and highperforming segment of the professional truck driving population that otherwise may go unserved generally or untapped by us the historical arrangement with our financial partner has been positive and we expect it to continue  however due to the significant growth of quality and with the additional capacity needed to grow fully with quality companies we believe it is in our best interest to diversify our sources of growth capital and encourage competitive terms  accordingly we have been seeking additional financial partners financing joint venture will commented on th capital group we are fortunate to do business again with larsen maccoll partners and its affiliates lmp  lmp was the controlling shareholder of as kinard before our acquisition of that successful business  after reviewing multiple proposals for financing the quality companies fleet business most of which would have required direct or indirect credit support from us and resulting balance sheet consolidation lmp proposed a similar joint venture but with additional economic opportunity for us  the joint venture called th capital group is controlled by lmp with a minority investment by celadon and celadon management  the structure is expected to allow us to account for the investment under the equity method of accounting  in addition with this investment we will record a share of the joint ventures profit or loss on the lease income stream and residual sale value of the tractors which we currently do not share in under the contract with our current financing partner  tractor portfolio sale will addressed the portfolio sale  we sold a portfolio to th capital group for approximately  million  in addition we agreed to provide certain driver recruiting lease payment remittance maintenance and insurance services under related agreements we anticipate additional sales to th capital group in the future  the services and terms of these services are similar to those provided to our current financing partner celadon group inc wwwceladongroupcom through its subsidiaries provides longhaul regional
