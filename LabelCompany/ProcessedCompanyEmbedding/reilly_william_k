protection agency search search william k reilly oral history interview foreword this publication is the fourth in a series of interviews of epa leaders that includes william ruckelshaus russell train and alvin alm the epa history program undertook this project to preserve distill and disseminate the main experiences and insights of the men and women who have led the agency epa decision makers and staff related government entities the environmental community scholars and the general public will all profit from these recollections separately each of the interviews will describe the perspectives of particular leaders collectively these reminiscences will illustrate the dynamic nature of epas historic mission the personalities and institutions which have shaped its outlook the context of the times in which it operated and some of the agencys principal achievements and shortcomings the techniques used to prepare the epa oral history series conform to the practices commonly observed by professional historians the questions submitted in advance are broad and openended and the answers are preserved on audio tape once transcripts of the recordings are completed the history program staff edits the manuscripts to improve clarity factual accuracy and logical progression the finished manuscripts are then returned to the interviewees who may alter the text to eliminate errors made during the transcription of the tapes or during the editorial phase of preparation a collaborative work such as this incurs many debts kathy petruccelli director of epas management and organization division provided the leadership to support the history program her superiors who have changed over the course of the period in which this interview has been produced john chamberlin director of the office of administration and jonathan z cannon assistant administrator for administration and resources management provided the funds susan denning and daphne williams performed invaluable proofreading and logistical services finally the crucial contributions of two epa administrators must be recognized carol browner who has seen fit to continue the epa history program in the face of tight budgetary times and william k reilly himself who not only has provided a candid and highly insightful interview but also was responsible for creating the epa history program epa administrator william k reilly biography   william k reilly b jan   served as the seventh senate confirmed epa administrator between february   and december   born in decatur illinois into a conservative deeply religious household reilly was strongly influenced by his father a highway construction steel merchant who impressed upon him an interest in land history especially that of abraham lincolns illinois days and justice through the example he set while young reilly accompanied him to state and county auctions to peddle his steel culverts and bridge materials reillys father then led his family from illinois to south texas when william reilly was  there reilly learned to appreciate the unique cultural and environmental problems associated with transnational environmental affairs from the rio grande valley the reillys moved to fall river massachusetts where he finished high school at durfee high school from durfee he went on to yale where he earned a ba in history during his yale years reilly took advantage of yales junior year abroad program to study in france reilly then earned a law degree from harvard completing a thesis on land reform in chile after law school reilly entered the army and served a tour of duty  in europe with an intelligence unit planning for the evacuation of us troops from france during that time he married elizabeth buxton after completing his military service reilly returned to school at columbia where he earned a masters degree in urban planning in  fresh from planning school and a four month project in turkey reilly went to work for urban america inc where he worked to integrate century old concerns for urban beautification with the concerns brought to the forefront of the american conscience by the civil rights movement  concerns which would grow into the environmental justice movement with which he dealt during his epa administration in  reilly became a senior staff member of the presidents council on environmental quality ceq under russell train who would later become the second epa administrator in  reilly moved from ceq to become president of the conservation foundation which merged with world wildlife fund wwf in  after the merger he served as president of world wildlife fund until taking over the helm at epa in  as the following interview will show the reilly administration accomplished several important tasks between  and  epa oversaw the crafting of new clean air act amendments in  it pushed for leadership in international environmental affairs in the face of global political changes by establishing liaisons in eastern europe participating in trade negotiations to ensure that the environment was considered during the north american free trade agreement nafta and the general agreement on trade and tariffs and encouraged the agency to play a larger role in working with mexico to address problems along the mexican border both in environmentally and socially responsible ways reilly also encouraged epa to continue to work with the regulated community to find voluntary ways to go beyond mandated emissions standards reilly also encouraged epa to address regional pollution problems which forced the agency to strive to design crossmedia regulatory strategies these strategies had been discussed but deemed too unmanageable and complex to devote vast amounts of energy in the face of more pressing needs by previous administrations perhaps the most significant failure of the reilly administration as reilly suggests below was that epa was unable to garner the unalloyed support of the bush administration during the second half of that administrations term this was largely due to the inability of the agency to muster the politically valuable praise of the administrations environmental efforts by environmental organizations as a result the bush administration chose to work more closely with elements of its constituency that would provide political support during the  election season as a result epa found its agenda stifled in the white house and its credibility compromised before congress after leaving the agency during the final days of  reilly returned to world wildlife fund from his office in that institutions headquarters reilly summed up his time at epa by saying i find myself introduced sometimes as the voice that cried in the wilderness as someone who tried to be the conscience of the bush administration on the environment i went into that job with no illusions i knew all of my predecessors i knew how much conflict there had been and how many disappointments some of them had had in their times in fact i had many more than my share of good days i remember bill ruckelshaus said as he announced his retirement his resignation from epa that an epa administrator gets two days in the sun the day hes announced and the day he leaves and everything in between is rain that was not true for me i had a lot of sunny days and i owe them to george bush and    it is thanks largely to the quality of the people who work at epa their zeal their commitment the fact that for them its not just a job they really believe in what theyre doing and that they are doing something fundamentally important that is what made our four years a very productive and exciting time its a time that epa professionals and the country beyond washington will look back on as a time of enormous creativity and energy and achievement in the environment so i was happy to have been along for that ride interview session  july   world wildlife fund headquarters washington dc early life q mr reilly would you please describe for me your upbringing your early life and your education mr reilly i was born in decatur illinois into a very closeknit very religious and very conservative family my father was in business for himself he sold steel  bridge materials reinforcing bars and metal culvert through his own highway supply company and my mother worked very closely with him she was his bookkeeper accountant and partner i had one older sister four and a half years older than i who is now a teacher outside of chicago i lived for  years in decatur illinois  downstate illinois  a city then of about  population its not too much more now i grew up surrounded by lincoln memorabilia and memories my father sort of rode the circuit just as lincoln did but for a different purpose he traveled to county lettings  auctions  and state lettings and township lettings to sell his materials whenever we would pass a lincoln marker we would stop the lincolndouglas debates took place in that area every single courthouse had its lincoln memorabilia because he typically argued cases in those courthouses or their predecessors its farm country and we had a farm i spent some time on that i went to parochial schools there catholic schools when i was ten we moved to texas southern texas largely because a big steel strike in  pretty much put my fathers business on hold for four or five months  he didnt have anything to sell we relocated to the rio grande valley my father was for a little while working for dow chemical then he went to work on his own as a contractor and did some construction i remember that was the time when i became familiar with some of the problems that we now call colonias  these unsewered communities without any services at all typically of undocumented aliens or firstgeneration mexicanamericans along the border my father employed some undocumented workers in fact he got in trouble with the local construction contractor establishment because he paid them too much i remember that we used to drive out in the country to pick them up in the morning and then drive them back out in the evening i saw the abject poverty that they lived in i got to know some one became a good friend neither of us had many friends then in texas he was in his twenties i was then probably  his name was dom juan garza whenever he was picked up by the bureau of immigration and taken to mexico he would reappear within a few days having walked all night if necessary and ready to do anything  pick grapefruit or work at the motel where i first met him and where he was a worker i developed some limited knowledge but a lot of affection and respect and sympathy for mexicans i think that affected my later priority on some of those issues at epa one of the proudest things i did was to help get  million for colonias in the last bush budget  and a lot of money for the border i worked hard on the north american free trade agreement too i lived in the rio grande valley for two years it didnt really work too well for my father economically there we finally then moved to northern illinois by that time he was quite ill he had serious ulcers after another two years when i lived in st charles illinois he had one of the first operations to remove most of his stomach to recuperate from that he went back to live with his sister in fall river massachusetts by that time my sister was off in college and my mother and i went with my father when he was finally recovered and ready to go back to illinois i just stayed behind because i had started high school and was doing well there he left me there in the care of my aunt so i went to a large public high school in massachusetts for four years durfee high id go out and work drive for him in illinois in the summertime when i finished high school i went to yale i spent my junior year in france and then after that went to harvard law school followed by half a year or so in law practice two years in the army and then another year and a half in school at columbia studying urban planning so ive had somewhat of a wandering upbringing in various parts of the country which i must say i never minded i always thought that the moves we made were pretty interesting the parts of the country i lived in the middle west and its prairie and farm country and the germanirish settlement influence and texas which was very heavily hispanic  even then the city i lived in harlingen was about  percent hispanic then up to the northeast to fall river which had the only french daily newspaper in the united states at that time had twentysome frenchspeaking catholic churches and another twentysome portuguesespeaking churches and a lot of italianspeaking churches a very large ethnic population  syrians lebanese jews a really fascinating melting pot to be exposed to  very different from the midwest where i had begun life so i thought each of those moves was enriching in one respect or another the fall river era was the time i came to love the sea and came to know cape cod and newport rhode island providence mount hope bay and some of those areas my family vacationed there and most of my aunts and uncles and cousins lived around there anyway after harvard i went to practice law for a little while in chicago but had a commitment to go in the army so i took the bar exam in both massachusetts and illinois and then went into the army i went to the infantry officers school in ft benning georgia intelligence officers school in baltimore maryland ft holabird and had orders to vietnam much of that time then at the last minute my orders were changed and i was sent to germany with a little group of sixteen or seventeen  the first intelligence officers class in two or three years to have been sent to europe because by that time we were depleting our intelligence officer numbers in nato with everyone going to vietnam my responsibility was to help plan the quick departure of our forces or at least the army intelligence component of them from france after de gaulle gave the us forces  days to get out my knowledge of french and being a lawyer had a very practical advantage it resulted in my being assigned very interesting work in europe i did that and then went to german language school as part of my army experience in europe when i had fewer than  months to serve less than the standard vietnam tour of duty and thus could no longer be sent there i came home to get married to elizabeth buxton a woman i had met at harvard we were married at st thomas more chapel at yale where her father was a professor and chairman of the psychology department after another year in germany i came back to a different country really in early  the place was very different from what it had been when i left the antiwar movement was going strong there was a lot of antiauthority feeling in the schools  in fact i was scarcely at columbia a few months when mark rudd and the students for a democratic society shut it down beginning with the school i was in the architecture school where i was an urban planning student for a few days i was annoyed about that but then i realized this was a marvelous education so i used to go up to the columbia campus every day and just listen to the speeches whether they were by mark rudd and his colleagues in sds or black panthers or whoever was holding forth that day i went to columbia because of charles abrams a really great man who had written mans struggle for shelter in an urbanizing world he was an architect of the  housing bill with senator percy and with the hud secretary i did three semesters there after which they awarded me a masters degree i spent a summer working on a regional planning project in turkey on which my wife accompanied me she had worked for the city planning department of new haven and had more experience than i had i thought at that time i wanted to be some kind of international urban planner and consultant but in turkey we experienced very strong antiamerican feeling our new ambassador was fresh from the vietnam pacification program ambassador komer and his car was turned over and burned on his first visit to the university with which we were affiliated middle east technical university that summers experience indicated to me that it wasnt a good time for americans to be going around the world telling other people how to behave so i came back and ended up going to work for something called urban america incorporated which i thought i would just do for a year or so before going back to my law practice in chicago as it turned out i never went back urban america inc merged with the national urban coalition then the presidents council on environmental quality which was setting up and looking for a land use lawyer went to my old law firm for advice about whom to pick they suggested me so i found myself one of the councils first staff members under russell train and was given the job of helping draft the regulations  they were then guidelines  implementing the national environmental policy act and the environmental impact statement procedures i also drafted a national land use policy act that was the only one of the big legislative proposals on which we worked in the early s that did not make it into law the coastal zone management act is essentially the same bill that i had drafted based on the american law institutes model land development code so we got a piece of it a grant incentive program for the coast but not for the whole country after two years there i was invited to direct a task force on land use for the presidents commission on environmental quality chaired by laurence s rockefeller we produced a report in  the use of land a citizens policy guide to urban growth which went through three printings and sold  copies i accepted an invitation then to become president of the conservation foundation in  it affiliated with world wildlife fund and later merged completely in  i became president of both institutions thats where i was when president bush asked me to become epa administrator thats probably more than you wanted to know interest in land use management q no that was very thorough it covered several questions i do want to go back just a second though you earned your juris doctorate and then returned from europe and earned a masters in urban planning reading your resume it seemed to me that there was a big jump there was there something that had happened before going into the military or during the time you were in the military that encouraged an interest in land use management can you explain that mr reilly well i was always interested in land and i have often tried to figure out why that was  whether it was because we had a farm early on and i spent a lot of time there or because my father was interested in land we used to look at land he used to think about buying it  he liked to think about buying a lot more property than he ever bought i can remember looking at beautiful oceanfront property with him near point judith in rhode island i honestly dont know where the motivation came from but i did my law school thesis on land reform in chile with charles harr i worked one summer on a book with a team of people headed by lawrence wylie who was then c douglas dillon professor of french civilization at harvard the book we wrote was called chanzeaux village danjou published by harvard university press in english and by gallimard in french basically my part of it was to write about land tenure agricultural law the passage of property to children credit systems how the french were trying to reassemble parcels that had been divided through generations of napoleonic law in fact i chose to go to work for ross hardies in chicago because they were the premier law firm dealing with land use issues certainly in chicago and probably in the country i found myself working on gas rate regulation which was also a large part of their practice later i decided to go to planning school partly to get reintroduced to the country having been away at a time of great social change and turmoil but partly also to help ensure that if i did or when i did go back to the law firm i would be used in the area of my interest because i would have a degree in urban planning urban america incorporated for which i worked following my studies at columbia was concerned with what seemed to me the two great themes in american city development one was race and civil rights and the other was planning the city beautiful movement  the frederick law omsted tradition and the parks and the rest very few of our institutions have been successful at bridging the divide between those two concerns social policy and development policy generally for the broader population they tried to do that i became an expert in how you prevent communities from using large lot zoning or minimum lot sizes to exclude minorities and poor people at that time i didnt think that i knew very much about conservation law or how to protect land i can recall saying to timothy atkeson who was my immediate boss at the council when i started there  he was general counsel and he later became my assistant administrator at epa for international activities in   i said to him i dont really know much about how you protect land from development im really an expert at breaking down restrictive procedures and laws he smiled and said well its really just the oher side of the same coin isnt it and of course it is i found myself then working on protection schemes  but not completely with the help of fred bosselman a ross hardies lawyer i drafted a federal legislative proposal to provide funds to communities to protect what we called areas of critical environmental concern and also to ensure that development of regional benefit be accommodated even against the wishes of localities that resisted it it was a balanced approach which i think we have to have in our land use and development law so i kind of sidled into the conservation side of law and cant say that this was a charted course or a direct route but it happened to be mine council on environmental quality q you told me a little bit about how you became involved in the council on environmental quality ceq was this the first encounter you had with russell train mr reilly yes i remember going to visit him at the interior department when he was undersecretary there just prior to his taking up his new position as ceq chairman and having an interview with him after i had been interviewed by timothy atkeson atkeson told me that i should tackle him as he came through the hallway there he came through a little out of breath  coming from the congress i think  and i immediately jumped up and started to speak to him in a minute in a minute he said let me catch my breath ill call for you in a few minutes i can remember in fact the first conversation i overheard with him someone said to him were going to have a phone installed in your car this week and he said good lord why do you want to do that its the only peace and quiet i ever get when i served at epa i discovered why he might not have wanted a phone in his car truly the only peace and quiet you get in public life is traveling in an airplane although now theyre getting phones in planes too he called for me and then interviewed me we had a very nice interview and always got on well i became not only a land use staff member at the council but i ended up writing a number of speeches on other issues for him as well he became a mentor to me i suppose if i have two in public life they are russell train and bill ruckelshaus in fact train has had most of the jobs that i have had for the last  years he preceded me as president of the conservation foundation as president of world wildlife fund as epa administrator ive not gone on the tax court and i dont intend to  not that they would have me but i have enormous respect for him and have learned a great deal from him other mentors q would you say that you had any other mentors mr reilly i certainly had another mentor in a man named john bross john adams bross who was a cia official and member of the conservation foundation board from  on he was thoughtful very modest and very cultivated in an unassuming way he had a wry twinkly humorous attitude towards a lot of things and particularly was able to be funny about the things that a lot of people would be pompous about  things that he knew and had experienced he knew shakespeare and he knew art and he knew government and politicians and he knew people hed known the important ones whod come through washington over the last  years or so i can recall many a fine lunch with him where i just soaked up the kind of wisdom he tossed off nonchalantly i remember in fact i went directly from my announcement as epa administrator at the white house with president bush to his hospital room and talked to him about everything hed seen it on television he had a bad case then of cancer it had him in the hospital but he recovered for another couple of years and died just about two years ago now my father of course has been a very important figure in my life too very strong very generous capable of being severe but also quite compassionate to people who need help very religious i often think how much easier ive had it than he had it he was a child of the depression as a teenager he worked on the fall river line on a boat that went back and forth from fall river to new york he was also a dining car steward on the pennsylvania railroad then he went out on his own to illinois very bravely without any health insurance or benefits or retirement or any security or clear prospects at all it took him two or three years before he made any money at all he pretty much was supported by his brother who was also in the business and would give him an advance for the week he finally had a big success at the illinois state fair where he sold a big pile of steel culvert several times over metal culverts to township commissioners responsible for country roads and drainage who were coming through he was able to make that the start of his success in business but he worked very very hard for what he got and paid the price in his health he later recovered that and has been a very successful man by any measure but i think he has the sort of divine discontent that characterizes a lot of artists and perfectionists he sees a lot of ways that things could have been better he gave me a great education and obviously valued that tremendously he also made great sacrifices not just financial but in allowing me to stay in massachusetts where he thought i was going to get a better high school education than if i had moved around with him which is certainly true what he and i did was always with the great support of my mother who is a very warm loving tolerant person and who has no rough edges she just communicated a great love and security to me that probably has a good deal to do with my sense that life would go on and it would unfold in ways that i would probably like  which it has successful confident men tend not to talk much about their mothers ive noticed though more than anyone its mothers who make for secure sons i think unlike my father my mother radiated a quiet reassuring faith in the future and a sunny optimism like my mother i dont worry a lot q what would you say youve learned from mr ruckelshaus mr reilly ruckelshaus had a very clear concept of the need not only to ensure integrity in public service in government as a government official but also to communicate to the country what a government agency was doing and why i saw my job in very large part in  as one of communication at that time and certainly now we had more diffuse anxieties in the country than we could ever craft policies and programs to address the public is very concerned about risk  particularly the involuntary kind the kind that they believe theyre subjected to by chemicals in their food or pollutants in the air or water they need to have all of that put in perspective and they need to embrace some sense of proportion people need to have some guidance from a trusted source about what matters and what doesnt or rather about what matters most and what matters less that is necessary for epa to do its job with respect and credibility we heard in  as we continue to hear that epa isnt doing this or that or its missing this or that milestone of course its always true its a consequence of so many responsibilities that have been given the agency without sufficient authority or resources to carry them out but ultimately government is accountable to people and its people who are causing their congressional representatives to write these bills and to continue to write them even though the money isnt there any longer in fact the epa budgets gone down this year very substantially from what the last bush budget was the only way to do that is to cause people to believe fundamentally that there is integrity in the process  those in government do know what theyre doing second of all some things pose much less risk to people than others and officials need to acknowledge that in their public representations to the congress and finally in the budgets and priorities that the agency proposes the only way that you arrive at that point is through constant communication i think that ruckelshaus had a clear sense of that certainly at the very beginning of epa he spent considerable time on it and when he came back in  he spent even more time on that i believe in that he was not excessively focused on the congress or on the internal workings of the bureaucracy which happens to so many agency leaders he recognized the broad country out there from which our mandate comes but also whose sense of priorities have shaped the program that needs reform international interests q you mentioned a bit earlier about going to europe and then turkey and experiencing those places would you say that was the origin of your keen interest in international work or would you say that came from something else mr reilly the truth is that i think i developed my international interests as a high school student in fall river massachusetts who was just fascinated by some of the french convent girls who were sheltered from us nonfrench folks i remember trying to crash the francoamerican dances and having people grill me at the door about whats your name whats your mothers name and then saying well sorry you cant come in here there were five convent schools i think then and i eventually succeeded in dating one of those girls i was very interested in french and in france when i applied to college i only applied to two schools georgetown and yale i made it very clear in my application that their junior year abroad programs were part of what i was applying for i was true to that i went on to study in france ive spent a lot of time abroad in the course of my life i worked a number of summers and then studied one full academic year in france i spent one summer in switzerland working for the united nations while i was in law school i spent one summer hitchhiking all over europe  i used to hitchhike whenever i went there in fact i hitchhiked one summer starting out in paris across england to wales to ireland and all around ireland back across england and then across belgium and to germany up to stockholm and back from stockholm almost down to vienna i learned a lot doing that  thats a good way to get to know a place i lived for a year and a quarter in germany and went to language school there when i was in the army i lived for four months in turkey in  when i went there on a regional planning project ive had about  summer vacations in italy a friend has a place there that our family often goes to i spent two weeks in spain and two weeks in mexico this past spring just working on language i like europe a lot and ive always thought it was very important i was a history major in college and believe with degaulle that america is the daughter of europe europe is obviously the cradle of our civilization our values and our institutions and i have become very interested in latin america when i was president of world wildlife fund that was my principal area of interest mexico and brazil were wwfs two biggest programs and central america was a large one i then set out to learn spanish and came to understand that part of the world much better im sure that the international interest was the reason why i gave such priority to some things at epa  like the border plan and the north american free trade agreement for which i testified six or seven times i discovered incidentally that as far as i could ascertain no environmental minister from any country had ever gotten involved in a trade treaty nor had an epa administrator testified on a trade treaty i thought that the nafta was very important to the environment but also very important to our mexicanamerican relationship and the stability of mexico i continue to give a high priority to that and one of the public lectures i deliver in the fall at stanford will be on international institutions another one will be on trade and the environment both of them very international in orientation we are part of a larger world and the environment of that world is one that cannot be managed successfully by one country it cannot be managed because the pollutants travel and dont respect borders it also cannot be managed because we are going to be in a web of trade relationships for which the environment can be misused for protectionist purposes to exclude goods by claiming their production harms the environment or to create a competitive advantage at the expense of the environment  by having lax controls that make your products cheaper ie by creating a pollution haven as we gradually relieve the tariff burdens on trade countries will pursue their economic interests through other means very often those other means will be by saying well were not clamping down on beef hormones to keep your beef out but rather because its environmentally unacceptable and so forth that will require people who are concerned about the environment to become much more knowledgeable about trade and to come to respect the need for free trade because it advances the environment aside from advancing other aspects of welfare but we need to advance trade interests with a sense of protection for those things that we value and dont want to see unraveled  which trade people often insensitive to environmental controls can unwittingly unravel i dont know how i got there your question didnt necessarily lead all over there did it the conservation foundation and world wildlife fund q it didnt necessarily but that was a good path what did you learn from your earlier experiences with the conservation foundation and world wildlife fund mr reilly the conservation foundations niche was to recognize those issues on which the country was stalemated or which were not being very successfully addressed but in which we saw an opportunity in the midseventies when the oil shocks hit and the economic crisis occurred there was a sense that we had bitten off quite a lot in the environment we had passed laws on air and water and strip mining and toxic substances and coastal zone management and endangered species  many of them quite ambitious and virtually all of them more expensive and in some cases more obstructive of other interests than had been understood the economic community which was capable of helping us refine and make efficient many of those laws had pretty much opted out of their early formulation they had fought them so bitterly that they werent really at the table in helping craft regulations yet it seemed to me that the environmental community could not take those laws much further alone and certainly couldnt ensure their successful efficient implementation without the involvement of business these laws were coming under heavy fire for their cost and bureaucracy particularly at a time of national economic difficulty the business community was being driven crazy by some of the early costs of regulation the demands being placed on them and also by the public image they were getting as obstructionists and yet any reasonable reading of the polls it seemed to me indicated that the nation was wedded to environmental values wanted to see those laws kept and in some cases wanted to see them strengthened the environment was entering the core values as the pollster bob teeter has put it of our people if you think of those two sets of interests  of environmentalists wanting to see the laws they had championed work and industrialists realizing that environmentalism was here to stay and therefore the realistic goal was to achieve more costeffective implementation  you realize there is a common basis for getting some agreements between business and environmental groups based upon that in  we developed a program in business and the environment which tried to get consensus on critical divisive issues such as on road building in national forests which environmentalists prefer to keep as little intrusive as possible and which the timber industry also doesnt want to have to build wider or more expensively than necessary toxic substances control and the early implementation of a new toxics law was another issue we took on then we sponsored a project on natural gas with the committee on economic development project participants advocated deregulating natural gas prices in order to bring on a fuel that would really help the environment and was in plentiful supply in the united states we had a program on groundwater chaired by governor babbitt that included business leaders environmentalists state and federal officials it designed measures that would protect groundwater and give some clarity and certainty to the development process babbitt had done that very well in arizona we followed that project up with a major task force on wetlands chaired by governor kean of new jersey and that was designed to try to bring people together on that very divisive subject out of that group came the recommendation for no net loss of wetlands the recommendation that president bush committed to in the  campaign and later became a priority of epa and the administration the groundwater report fed into policies that we implemented at epa also those reports had farreaching impact the conservation foundations operating style was relatively quiet very inclusive with a sense that we wanted to look for ways to bring people together around policies that would endure it always struck me as a conservationist that those policies will not endure that do not have the adherence of the economic sector we simply must embrace economics in our environmental formulation just as i think the economic sector has to factor in the environment and health now to a degree that it did not used to do if were to have a sustainable economy and also public support and acceptance of a lot of what the industrial sector does and wants to do so that was our philosophy world wildlife fund of course was almost exclusively an international institution it was active in latin america in africa and asia it too largely avoided stridency and confrontation we worked in some countries with rotten governments with undemocratic systems that we had to make peace with if we were going to continue to operate we worked through local institutions generally we tried to build up nongovernmental organizations and local pressure groups in many countries that lacked them we did not ourselves go in making noise to their public as americans but rather tried to get locals to study and to appreciate their environmental treasures in many cases their wildlife their flora and fauna we had access to decisionmakers to a degree that most environmental groups did not simply because the organization was a worldwide group with then   now i think   national organizations headed internationally by prince philip with significant people on most of the national organization boards so we had a good bit of influence for a conservation organization we also had a fair amount of money and resources but compared to the size of the problem or to what the economic sector deploys we didnt amount to a rounding error i gave again with that institution a priority to bringing economics and the environment together our flagship program there was something called wild lands and human needs recognizing that the traditional approach to protecting animals of punching a hole in the map or putting a fence around an area wasnt going to work hungry needy landpoor people cant be fenced out conservation must work for the people the culture in which it finds itself we had to find ways to accommodate the very legitimate development and economic demands of quite poor people who were multiplying in number who were often poaching in these parks or going in for resources  like cutting down the timber or gold mining in corcovado in costa rica people living near those great reserves had to gain by them had to see them as helpful to them very often we could do it  reconcile wildlife and human needs  with programs like ecotourism or agroforestry timber could be harvested in areas adjacent to important wildlife preserves and cut and marketed by cooperatives the object was to help people exploit the resources of their own environment but in a way that would allow them to continue to use and enjoy the environment over the long term while conserving a critical mass of species of flora and fauna i heard this concept put very well by president salinas of mexico a few weeks ago i accompanied him for three days as he was dedicating some new reserves in mexico in the yucatan deep in the jungle with the camposinos as his audience he said this forest is very valuable the ancient monuments here are valuable  not just because people pay good money which they do to come see the monuments and enjoy the jungle as important as the money is  not just for the wildlife which is also very valuable but its not as valuable as you are the reason to keep the forest is that out of the forest your ancestors and you have come it has sustained the groundwater under it it has created and made possible your culture and your society and only if you keep it will it continue to do so for the children of your children i dont think ive ever heard a head of government speak so simply and persuasively and eloquently to the natureculture relationship as he did people believe him and thats one reason hes still popular in mexico that essentially was my much less eloquently put vision for world wildlife fund when i was there and one that i think we did a good bit to advance at that time initial perception of the agency q before you came to epa what was your perception of the agency mr reilly you know i didnt have a terribly good impression of epa before i went there i think that i had been exposed to two kinds of criticism one is the stereotypical view held by much of the regulated sector which views epa as excessively concerned about small risks highly bureaucratic ludicrously protective sometimes always overestimating threats to health not very responsive to economic concerns and very insensitive to costeffectiveness i shared some of that view i think i partook also of the environmentalist critique of epa which is of a hidebound bureaucratic agency deeply scarred by the burford years riskaverse wrought up in its own systems in ways that cause decisions to take far longer than they should unwilling to embrace finality  partly for reasons of bureaucratic anxiety that if you keep the decision going you wont be subject to a nasty congressional hearing or to criticism i had lunch one day a couple of weeks before i was sworn in as epa administrator with a veteran journalist guy darst an associated press reporter he had been around forever and had covered a lot of agencies and said well youre going to the best really i said thats not the view on the street epa will make five decisions in the amount of time it would take interior or agriculture to make one and theyd still screw it up epa is at the intersection of science and public policy and economics and health he said and just has to keep turning out the decisions there is no place to hide thats the function and that has made the agency very good at what it does its very sophisticated i must say that was news to me at the time  that a very informed and quite objective observer would have that judgment thats the judgment i took away from the agencyof a group of highly motivated professionals with a great deal of élan one often hears people criticize that zeal and sometimes i suppose epa may be guilty of having a bit much of it but thats what makes it a joy to go to work there its one of those agencies where you get invigorated walking down the halls not one where the adrenaline flows out your shoes after about  feet  and we certainly have those in the federal establishment i remember a conversation with interior secretary manuel lujan one day he was talking about the difficulty that the secretary of the interior has dealing with the fish and wildlife service or the park service he said you give them an order and you have the feeling theyre not going to carry it out until they check with god whereas the bureau of reclamation or the bureau of mines salutes and performs then he laughed and he said oh for a moment i forgot who i was talking to all you have is people who take their orders from god you know what he means and thats true epa is a place with a moral fervor that sometimes can be excessive but it is a place with commitment and i think a great degree of professionalism i tried to broaden its perspective somewhat to make much more of economics of prevention of incentives rather than strictly holding people to account for doing bad i encouraged it to think about how to motivate regulated industry and about the whole larger world out there the international environment to which epa can be so helpful epas prestige rises almost directly in proportion to the distance one gets from washington in the rest of the world people do understand what many here at home dont which is epa is the place you go to for information about the environment for criteria documents for health information for the best science that we have on the health impact of pollutants and the way to set standards the best laboratory work on automobile pollution and increasingly on a number of other issues like indoor air pollution epa has more experience with remediation of toxic contamination than any other agency in the world these are all cuttingedge problems  they require so little relatively of the us government to be deeply lastingly helpful to south america to russia and eastern europe to china and taiwan i can recall having sent two or three people to latvia to deal with a spill in a river that provided their drinking water  a spill of some stuff that the russians dropped in the water inadvertently but hadnt bothered to warn the latvians about even though the age of glasnost had dawned the latvians detected an unfamiliar odor and figured out they had a problem and did not want russian experts we sent some professionals and i heard later from the latvian president that this was the most important american mission since lindberghs visit there we helped mexico when they had the big gas explosion and fire in guadalajara we sent a team to help morocco cope with a big oil spill we did those things and buried the costs in programs our professionals returned invigorated were animated energized by their encounter with a real need in another country whose environmental problems are so much more egregious than our own thus involvement with helping others was very useful to the agency and a very inexpensive way for the united states to express what is one of the most benign qualities of our culture our environmental aspirations and experience president bush   q you talked a bit earlier about the process by which you became epa administrator could you describe that in more detail and talk about what qualities president bush may have sought in an administrator and any particular sponsors you may have had mr reilly well you know that history  im not sure i understand it all i know that in the summer of  russell train who was then chairman of world wildlife fund hosted the ruckelshauses at his house in hobe sound florida i think in may or june not long after that he returned to say that he had had a conversation with bill ruckelshaus he quoted ruckelshaus as saying if our candidate george bush becomes president hes likely to turn to you and me for advice about who should be epa administrator and my advice would be reilly what would you think of that train who just three years before had initiated with me a big merger of the conservation foundation and world wildlife fund with me then taking over the organization as chief executive officer and him as board chairman obviously wasnt going to find it convenient to see me run off to government nevertheless he told ruckelshaus that he couldnt disagree upon returning from florida he told me of the conversation with ruckelshaus and he asked what would you do if that were offered to you i said id say no i said i hadnt really completed what i had set out to do with wwf there was a lot of continuing work necessary to make our two institutions mesh i really liked what i was doing i liked the international character of it and i just didnt know how serious george bush would be about the environment anyway so he said when a president asks you to do something its pretty hard to turn him down so id just like to ask you to think about your succession here how that would work should this invitation come i didnt hear anything more about it until the day after the election ruckelshaus called me up and said would you like to do something in this administration he mentioned epa administrator and interior secretary i said no he said well if people were to talk to you would you agree with me not to turn it down or say no until you get in front of the presidentelect because he doesnt talk to enough people like you if you have that encounter with him you can probably have some influence on his thinking early on whatever you do i think ruckelshaus figured that if i ever got that close to the president it would be pretty hard to say no to him my wife later told me that she decided the previous june when she heard of the conversation with train that i would do what the president wanted me to do she didnt see me saying no i remember a lot of our friends would say how was it that when hardly any of your colleagues in harvard law school ever ended up in the army you did she would point to me and say patriot it was true i thought you should serve i came out of the midwest and even though i didnt like the vietnam war much i thought one served the country in the military and when i finally did get in front of the presidentelect i found it impossible to say no to him someone had said to me in the transition  i guess bob teeter finally got in touch with me and talked with me about what they were looking for  and said very frankly that they were going to tilt one way at interior and another way at epa and that id come highly recommended by ruckelshaus i however went through that fall without any formal meetings other than the one ruckelshaus conversation where he said he thought they would be getting in touch with me they didnt call for at least a month or a month and a half then i began reading that i was one of the two hot candidates under consideration but still no one had talked to me my friend phil shabecoff called me one day he was the new york times environmental correspondent he said i have it on very good authority that you are on a short list of three do you know about this nothing more than i read in the newspapers i said thats very strange he said this comes from a good authority but he said there is something wrong with my epa list whats that i asked elizabeth dole is on this list and shes politically ambitious he said what does that mean i asked he said well youd never go to epa if you had any political aspirations it would be the graveyard for those hopes he talked about the position said it was an impossible job he said that it requires you to master more data and information than any job hed ever covered its a thankless job youll make enemies he said youll end up without any friends probably in your own community and you wont make anybody else happy he later changed his mind and said that he had reconsidered and that he should have encouraged me to go there i guess i was finally called in early december i had a meeting with teeter and then was to meet with craig fuller but he was ill finally then i was invited to meet with presidentelect bush i had about  minutes with him with craig fuller present at the end of that he did not offer me the job he said he wanted to check a few things first  although in the course of that conversation he had asked fuller where do we stand on this its ready to go or fuller said you can talk to someone else if you want to that wont be necessary bush said the next day he called me up hed been trying to hold the secret obviously about ten or eleven he called me up and asked me to be his epa administrator and invited me to come over about two and said he would announce it in public and introduce me to the white house press corps i told him i would work to make him a great environmental president i never really knew a lot about his thinking other than from one evening in the netherlands when mrs bush and the queen of the netherlands were talking at a state dinner in the netherlands and i was part of that conversation queen beatrice asked mrs bush where they had found me she said to the queen for epa george said i want the best nothing else no politics no partisanship just the best we can find everybody said well if thats what you want bill reillys the person you want to get that could have been very generous on mrs bushs part but thats the sum total of my exposure to their thinking about it all i remember train said that he thought i would get on very well with bush that our temperaments would mesh well and certainly they did he and mrs bush were very generous very kind to my wife libbie our children katherine and margaret and me through all of that they communicated even when we had difficulties with the white house staff he had a fundamental confidence in what i was doing and when things mattered a great deal to me he would take them seriously he always kept his promise to provide access when i needed it to talk to him and kept a promise to ensure that i didnt get anybody i didnt want in any of the key jobs as some of the current cabinet are discovering that is a very valuable commitment to have from the president and very few people get it but i got it he did say to me at our initial interview there wasnt any more money for epa and that the budget would not be going up he asked what that would do to my standing in the environmental community and whether i was prepared for that in fact we did a lot better than he had led me to expect we would because we increased epas operating funds by  percent on our watch and the overall budget by about  percent thats a measure of bushs support for which he didnt get much credit during his term though the league of conservation voters later wrote approvingly of our budget performance q during that one hour meeting and subsequently did he or any of the white house staff give you specific advice on what he expected you to do or not to do at epa mr reilly no and its interesting that you dont necessarily get that in top jobs i dont believe my predecessors ever got a clear sense from their president of that bush expressed his own philosophy he said im not a rapeandruin developer and im not for locking everything up either he said he believed in balance thats really my philosophy its one of integration and reconciliation of priorities thats a philosophy i can subscribe to its really very close to my own im sure thats the way ruckelshaus had characterized me to him he seemed very open to ideas when i talked to him i remember that i thought well i dont know if im going to talk to him again or if im going to be offered or accept this job but im sure going to use my time well so i told him about debt for nature which i had been working on for two or three years the concept of forgiving debt or writing down debt in hard currencies dollars and having some portion of the forgiven amount being applied to conservation in local soft currencies in the debtor country he said well thats a hell of an idea i remember thinking ive been working for three years on that and if id just gotten the president of the united states to think that it was a good idea id really advanced the ball of course it did reveal to me the enormous potential power in access to the president and in the kind of job he was talking about my taking that certainly had an impact on me we talked about cabinet status for the agency he was very frank and direct and said he didnt support it he said that he thought there were too many in the cabinet and he wanted a lean cabinet a small cabinet but he was open on the question at one point he said well if we could do that in lieu of putting out millions of dollars in new budget outlays that might be a good trade it was a very congenial conversation july   top epa personnel q mr reilly the last time we spoke you described your onehour meeting with president bush as you were deliberating whether or not to take the job at epa can you describe now your top personnel mr reilly i can recall that bill ruckelshaus had indicated to me early on that there were two problems endemic to the white houseepa relationship one was the omb regulatory review relationship and the other was personnel i found that the promise that president bush had made to me that there would be no one i didnt want at the agency which obviously meant that we both had a veto was kept it was hard slogging there was a lot of negotiation my first nominee was terry davies as assistant administrator for policy he was i think the lone democrat in the crowd and he was the last one agreed to by the white house white house personnel simply held hostage terry davies until they made sure the rest of the complement was to their liking i think that was a big mistake and they came to regret it it meant that the office of policy planning and evaluation had no champion and was not effectively represented in the formulation of the clean air act it might have been a somewhat different act had they been included the staff there was somewhat critical of parts of it but as counsel to the president boyden gray used to complain about not having oppe involved in it he was quick and generous in acknowledging that it was his and the white houses fault they hadnt given me terry davies until the clean air act had been forwarded to congress bill rosenberg a michigan developer and former energy official in the ford administration came to me with the very strong endorsement of bob teeter whod been central in the presidents election rosenberg wanted to be deputy as i recall clearly his energy and aggressiveness and imagination would be valuable to the new organization but his lack of epa and environmental experience did not in my view fit him so obviously for deputy as it did for assistant administrator for air which is where we put him i thought his relationship with teeter would bode very well for our working with the white house and his obvious energy would be a wonderful asset in seeing through the first major legislative program that we wanted that proved correct even though there later was considerable anxiety and handwringing about him in the white house he did the job the president and i asked him to do and the presidents domestic policy would have been much poorer without bill rosenberg but he drew the lightning of resentment about our very strong clean air bill we chose lajuana wilcher for assistant administrator for water i can remember she came to me with the highest endorsement of senator mitch mcconnell from kentucky who called to say that probably the senator from new york or california or illinois frequently had candidates of great quality and distinction to press upon a government agency head but he had never had one as senator from kentucky of the likes of lajuana wilcher that got my attention so i agreed to see her even though i had all but decided on a different candidate a congressional aide i remember i asked her what she thought of my having begun the process to review for possible veto the two forks dam a huge project in colorado she looked very serious and paused and said i think it was a mistake well you can imagine that was one of the most controversial decisions i had made there was a very heated debate at that time within the administration and in congress about what i had done and a great concern about it in some quarters in denver and other parts of the west for the prospective assistant administrator for water to tell me to my face that she didnt agree with it i thought was very brave and interesting i respected her independence and obvious integrity clearing her was no problem because senator mcconnell had been one of the two senators who had endorsed president bush before the convention tim atkeson the assistant administrator for international activities was a name whom the white house had already cleared on a list for the job he was an old friend and colleague much admired of mine id worked for him on the council on environmental quality in the early s so that was an easy choice for general counsel i can recall it came down to two candidates one was a lawyer with a new york city firm who no doubt wouldve done fine but to me lacked drive didnt look particularly imaginative or energetic the other was don elliott who was a very creative positive cando law professor from yale an expert on administrative law and very much interested in economic incentives and pollution prevention and innovative new directions in environmental law he was someone that colleagues found sometimes abrasive and professorial he gave good service to me and i never regretted that choice i thought he did an outstanding job don clay was a career figure he was about my fourth choice frankly for assistant administrator for waste i was never confident that i could get him through the white house in the end white house chief of staff sununu agreed to his appointment reluctantly late one evening sununu called me the next morning to say that he had changed his mind i was able to say i had already offered the job to clay i remember sununu said well hes part and parcel of that gang over there and im going to be watching him very closely hes on probation as far as im concerned if he steps out of line over the next six months were going to yank him in fact clay had built that marvelous air staff that rosenberg wielded so effectively he deserved a great deal of credit for that he had the respect of people inside the agency and i thought would immediately be perceived in the congress as a nonpolitical figure a professional which the waste office badly needed given the history of scandals in the early s i thought he also understood the need for reform of some of those laws he hadnt grown up with them he wasnt wedded to them and he could rethink them he also was a very good manager and thats one of the most difficult offices in the place to manage linda fisher was chief of staff to my predecessor lee thomas she also had been assistant administrator for policy planning and evaluation she had been very heavily involved in the reauthorization of the superfund law and had made some enemies in that as anybody who is effective will she was interested in international activities at the time but i frankly thought that i wanted a new face there  someone not identified with the previous administration speaking for me internationally but i concluded that she would be very good at pesticides and toxic substances i think she is outstanding and is qualified to be a future administrator she knew the agency well and was very effective she won the trust of everybody who dealt with her she gave me some of the most objective and rational and clear briefings of anyone she was a key negotiator on the environmental provisions of the north american free trade agreement she is a star the deputy is a slot that the white house paid a good deal of attention to and we actually had some arguments over it there were a couple of candidates that the white house pressed on me whom i did not find suitable one ill tell you a story about i didnt know the candidate personally and so i called al alm former deputy administrator of epa to ask if he knew this person he was in boston at the time in his office he paused upon hearing the name and said i have in front of me the boston telephone directory if i open it at random and select a name i will do a better job for you at finding a deputy than the one youve mentioned so that took care of that i had interviewed hank habicht and thought that i wanted to find a place for him at the agency i had known him somewhat previously  had come in contact with him when he was assistant attorney general and then when clean sites inc was looking for a new president he very much wanted to be deputy and i thought we had a very consistent understanding of the needs facing the agency and the role of the deputy that i envisioned i told the white house i didnt want their candidate considered him weak and unqualified the individual had some political support but i wanted a real deputy they said look just take this person and keep him out on the road and have your chief of staff run the agency i said i dont want to do that i want a genuine deputy who knows the place who does the job who is mr inside who is effective and respected and who will work with me as a colleague thats what i got in hank habicht beyond even my high expectations habicht proved outstanding i think the agency came to see him having had some reservations at first because of his history as assistant attorney general in the reagan years as a thoroughgoing professional  insightful sensitive a very good manager and a very bright prodder toward total quality management and toward reform of some of our laws he also proved to be extremely good at negotiating with the white house he has a very attractive even temperament and an obvious knowledge of the issues he does his homework and speaks with quiet authority that is compelling there have been a number of good administratordeputy relationships going all the way back to bill ruckelshaus and bob fri and then ruckelshaus and al alm this is in that league and i like to think is even better than that terrific record hank obviously is a future administrator or equivalent also the unsung hero of my administration at epa was gordon binder my chief of staff gordon missed nothing spotted problems and quietly fixed them shaped up personnel alerted me to various agency weaknesses or threats and faithfully communicated my views he was always objective could tell me unpleasant news and had a masterly control of the paper flow he had been with me for  years and knew i liked a taut congenial team with no backbiting no friction costs owing to petty competitive games no one was more helpful to me or to the agency in the bush administration than gordon binder conflicts with the white house q what was your relationship to the white house mr reilly the conflicts with the white house on policy matters started early budget director dick darman at the very first informational briefing that i gave on the clean air act went ballistic and indicated that ruckelshaus as epa administrator had brought an acid rain proposal over to the white house in which fish from the adirondacks were going to be valued at something like  a fish now reilly if anything has brought over something that is going to cost twice that much he said i said there are a lot fewer fish you should have taken the deal ruckelshaus offered you that was the tone of our exchanges for that period he startled me because his opposition seemed so fundamental i had rather assumed that  given the presidents very public commitments to a clean air act with three parts an acid rain title an ozonesmog title and an air toxics title  we would all get behind that get in harness and produce such a bill the budget director philosophically disagreed with that and didnt hide it he did not argue as though he considered that we were bound by those promises he doubted the seriousness of the air pollution problem in the united states it was a philosophy that david stockman had also espoused  in fact i think stockman had greatly influenced darman governor sununu i think at the beginning had difficulty knowing quite what to make of me obviously the chief of staffs job is a terrible job it involves taking responsibility for a very motley crew of people whom you dont select who have relationships with the president political histories with him who are valuable for one reason or another to constituencies and making a success out of all that getting some serious work out of that diversity sununu was quick bright and perceptive on a number of issues he was very helpful to me in the run up to our proposing the clean air bill he asked good questions knew the utility industry very well knew pricing policies and was familiar with the acid rain problem as former governor of new hampshire he paid less attention to other features of the bill and put roger porter in to oversee both our development of the legislation and our congressional shepherding of the law porter was very constructive and positive had endless meetings on the issues  wore people down that way sometimes  and produced with us a very good bill i think looking back on it it is a model on how public policy in the executive branch ought to be developed the originating agency was epa thats where the impressive conceptual work was done the staff that don clay had left behind in air had anticipated the need and had prepared themselves very well for the day when clean air would be on the agenda they had patiently done the analysis they had all the facts marshaled and the bill that finally emerged was in large part what they had written the president was himself directly responsible for the alternative fuels part of it i learned during a visit to rome with the president how strongly he felt about alternative fuels and the need to promote them the pollution rights trading concepts which are so imaginative and novel in that law came from a number of sources it owes a lot intellectually to resources for the future work that had been underway there for  years the environmental defense fund had worked with senators wirth and heinz on project  and had advanced those ideas and had played a very important role within the environmental community of giving them legitimacy and credibility in a community that was very deeply suspicious of them the council of economic advisors particularly bob hahn were very interested in those approaches and pressed that upon us and the bill was a vastly stronger bill as a result the speed with which we operated we owed to the staff at epa they put us in a position to be able to run out so far so fast had we not done that had we waited until the other agencies were better organized had their people in place which by and large they didnt when we first began moving the clean air act through i doubt we would have produced as strong a bill in fact i used to wonder if ever again in the bush administration had we been given the goahead we could have produced as complex and progressive a piece of legislation as the clean air act its one of those things that you get to do i think only in the first year perhaps even the first six months we had a very fast start i remember  partly the consequence of knowing what we wanted to do coming in we formulated right here in this office the concept  terry davies dan beardsley and i  of having epas science advisory board review the major threats to health and ecology and then the degree to which the agencys programs responded to those problems we got that started as soon as we got to epa we began work immediately on the clean air act the regional administrator for denver brought in the two forks dam issue to me at my very first briefing the acting administrator during the hiatus between administrations was jack moore and during those two weeks between administrators he began the cancellation process for alar and that meant that that was on my plate so we quickly moved to develop new food safety legislation after that incorporating the lessons i thought i had learned from that experience we got the agriculture department thanks to secretary clayton yeutter interested and supportive of that the exxon valdez oil spill occurred just about five weeks into my term that obviously took a lot of our time and we then began a followup to that the oil pollution act flowed out of that work and the survey of all the harbors in the united states followed we also got the president to commit the us to phaseout ozonedepleting chemicals by the year  and we completed a review of superfund all in the first six months it was an extremely busy productive exciting time there was also the international work we made a commitment within those few months to embrace a framework convention on climate change  something that governor sununu and i worked out late at night in his office after we learned that yet another negative story would appear the next day on the administrations slowness to appreciate this problem the president was becoming impatient and concerned and we made that commitment on the one hand one could say that there was conflict certainly between me and dick darman and not infrequently between the chief of staff governor sununu and myself but i felt it was a productive period and particularly credited governor sununu in that phase for accommodating the priority the president had committed to and probably the governor didnt really sympathize with he once said to me i wouldnt do this but were not doing it for me we work for him i always respected that about governor sununu i think despite our frequent encounters and differences of opinion we respected each other i in fact felt some affection for sununu i used to joke with him he had a sense of humor not many others did joke with him i recall going to a gas station with him where we were dedicating a new methanol pump with the president i was concerned with trying to get more publicity for this aspect of our program so i asked the governor if he could step over so i could pour some methanol on his shoe i said that it would serve two advantages one it would guarantee we got attention to the event  it would put us on the evening news and two it would clarify to the country that methanol was in fact safe  that is if his shoe didnt erode off well thats sort of a rambling answer to your question but anyway that characterizes i think the first six to nine months of it  at least within the white house itself there also i should point out was a very good early relationship with the president himself i remember when i learned about the exxon valdez accident i called governor sununu and said im going up there he said ill get back to you he found sam skinner on a golf course down in florida and sam agreed to cut short his easter vacation and go up there with me the coast guard which had legal responsibility under law for the spill was under him as secretary of transportation we went up and i can recall having a somewhat different reaction to the experience than sam did partly because i think he felt more need to defend the coast guard from our initial overflight i thought the response to the spill was woefully inadequate and ineffective all the protective booms were broken around the key rivers and streams the sea had been high the night before i got there we had been told that a dozen skimmer ships were at work i only saw two and neither one was working they werent suited to a major spill on open turbulent water when we came back i chose to tell the president exactly what i thought it occurred to me not to  i thought he is an oil man this is going to be distressing to him but i had remembered that i had reviewed the environmental impact statement on the alaska pipeline for the council on environmental quality in  or  and there had been predictions made that there would be this kind of event it didnt take a genius to realize that statistically one ship would eventually founder given all the money that had been made on oil by both alaska and the oil industry it seemed to me inexcusable that the capability to respond and control such a spill was so poor so i said so and described the history and what i had seen i later learned that after leaving the room  i learned from richard breeden who later became sec chairman but who was then a staff member for the white house  the president turned to governor sununu and said were lucky to have him over there thats one of the best things weve done knowing that helps to explain why my relationships were as good as they were with some other white house staff the president not only liked and respected me but he made known to others that he did so whatever resentments people may have felt about having an environmentalist on the team and after all many of these people were veterans of the reagan administration where the environment was not taken seriously it helped me both not just to stick around but to be effective the president did any number of other things that were generous and kind to my wife and me he had us to dinner at the white house to watch movies to some state dinners  i think over the period i was in office i went to five im not sure any of my predecessors had been to one i know my immediate predecessor had not we were at camp david a few times the president was just very generous particularly to someone who had no history with him who had not been involved in the campaign who had not been a party stalwart who didnt have a republican constituency or certainly a white house staff or insider constituency that mattered a great deal it particularly mattered when the going got rougher later i think he probably knew that jim cicconi who was assistant to the president and managed the paperflow told me that he felt that some of those personal invitations were efforts by the president to compensate for what he knew were very stormy relationships with others of his aides we did however make some enemies in work on the clean air act and got the reputation for being very aggressive and moving quite fast rosenberg bore the brunt of that he consistently played the role of flakcatcher for me which was useful to me but he accumulated scar tissue in the process assessment of president bush as the environmental president q you said that early on your relationship with the president was good you know that he ran on the platform  on the slogan anyway  of being the environmental president of course the environmental press harpooned him for that later on what is your assessment of president bush as the environmental president that he styled for himself in the campaign mr reilly looking back with as much objectivity as i can muster he kept his promise you typically judge a president according to three measures on an issue like the environment new initiatives for which the clean air act must stand as a milestone  progressive genuine response to the problem something that really will get most of the cities in the country into attainment within the next ten years budget commitments  the president raised the operating budget of epa  percent and the budget overall about  percent at a time when he didnt do that for other agencies he was equally generous with the land and water conservation fund and the environmental components of the interior department budget he increased waste cleanup funds in the energy and defense departments by several orders of magnitude enforcement is the third area if a president is trimming or an administration not on the level with the environment enforcement is where youll see it we set records for having put more people in jail for environmental crimes on our watch than in the whole previous history of the agency we also assessed more fines than in the previous year history of the agency we vastly increased the settlements under the superfund law precisely because we were enforcing the hell out of that law finally lawyers counseling corporations changed the advice they were giving to their client companies and said you better settle with these people theyre coming after you i took  people out of one part of the program and put them into enforcement precisely to create that effect and it worked we ended up cleaning up superfund sites at the rate of one a week which was meteoric compared to the previous history of that program i think that you have to credit the president who also supported me on the two forks dam  it was difficult for him to do it wasnt easy he saw food safety legislation go up to congress that was anathema to the house agriculture committee  it never went anywhere because of that but was nevertheless progressive and needed some of the international initiatives like the forest for the future program and the presidents proposal at the  houston g summit of a forest convention those are very significant measures as are the three new marine sanctuaries the nearly  miles of wild and scenic rivers he established  million acres of wilderness  i think new wildlife refuges and some parks from an environmental perspective this was a very vigorous administration the decision to close down the california coast to further oil and gas development was very difficult for president bush as an oil man who believed that the technology was there and that societys needs had to be met with more oil these were important moves that should have worked better for him politically they didnt work well for him politically because there was an ambivalent kind of conflicted body language that we communicated i think governor sununu and dick darman were more than anyone else  later quayle and the competitiveness council  responsible for that it muddied the waters they failed to communicate a consistent environmentalism in fact they seemed to be constantly skeptical about things environmental in their remarks to the press and in their speeches we were and were perceived as a divided administration but our thrust was very environmental particularly for the first two years when it didnt work for the president and he began to be challenged from the right and we also had economic problems the president distanced himself from his environmental record he came to accept the quayle sununu darman view that there was no constituency for the environment that offered him anything politically and no public incentive or encouragement to stay on the issue even for the clean air act he only got credit from environmental group spokesmen after it was passed for the  months it took to get it passed we took daily drubbings in the press because one part of it or another wasnt to their liking or wasnt sufficiently strong they later acknowledged it was a significant law henry waxman said it was owed to the two georges george bush and george mitchell but that was a brief moment of glory in a long tough slog by then sununu was aggressively negative on anything environmental environmentalists had particularly vilified him as negative on the issue and he was open in his contempt for them i think the environmental community failed to behave in a way that rewarded environmental good conduct and thereby made a strategic mistake i cannot say with certainty that things would have come out differently particularly in rio and on the international front had they played the president differently but i think they might have environmental groups simply created no rewards and there were significant penalties out there in the form of both the bad press they were generating and impatience on the part of the traditional republican constituency  of farmers concerns about wetlands and businessmens concerns about regulation  that werent offset by compensating new support or encouragement executive branch coordination q you mentioned vice president quayle and the competitiveness council and richard darman at the office of management and budget omb and their less than environmental approach to matters within the white house what is your assessment of the whole concept of regulating the regulator through omb processes or through sort of an adhoc council on competitiveness mr reilly there is a function that some white house agency must play for the president of coordination and policing it affects all agencies or should the fact is the reach of epa authority is such that it will affect energy policy economic policy development policy housing policy agricultural policy and it would be unreasonable to expect that an epa administrator alone ought to be able to make those decisions also a president wants to have some focus some clear direction some unity in the way his administration behaves and is perceived its necessary for those two purposes then to have a coordinating body however the coordinating body needs to respect the same principles that govern the agency itself in making particular decisions i was continually amazed that the kinds of contacts and information that epa was restricted in having at least ex parte other than on the record with notes taken and memoranda prepared and acknowledgments in the record went on unconstrained by these rules all the time with people in the executive office of the president it was not uncommon in my time to get back comments from the office of management and budget or the competitiveness council that incorporated verbatim lobbyist documents that we had seen from trade associations three or four months before on particular matters of concern in legislative or regulatory policy that had a very demoralizing effect on epa finally as this sort of thing came to the attention of congressman waxman and others it resulted in unpleasant but very well publicized hearings the lack of transparency in that executive office process and the disregard for the regulatory procedures that we had built up i thought undermined our credibility they certainly contributed to a great deal of criticism and suspicion so i think the function is necessary but it needs to be quite specifically circumscribed respect procedures everyone understands and not involve wholesale disregard for the kinds of constraints that affect a regulatory agency bill ruckelshaus and russell train q you mentioned having bill ruckelshaus and russell train as significant mentors did you have an ongoing relationship with them while you were administrator and what impact did their advice such as they gave you during that time have on your thinking and the decisions you made mr reilly my relationship with bill ruckelshaus was episodic and infrequent principally because he was running a waste company we did have a breakfast one morning at the jefferson hotel at which i made a pitch to him that he should chair a committee of the national academy of sciences on climate a whistleblower at epa later tried to get that encounter investigated on the grounds that i had probably engaged in something improper and ruckelshaus had probably lobbied me to do something that would benefit his company that experience made meetings alone with bill ruckelshaus somewhat risky for me and i didnt have any more though i did meet with him in the company of others from time to time i often had lunch  i say often probably every three or four months  with russell train and always found him thoughtful and reflective he gave me some advice going in that i found very useful he said you dont have a lot of friends in this administration you dont have a history with these people you dont have a political constituency that will support you so pay attention to the press they could become an important ally of yours i think you will do well with them that will annoy the white house when they see you getting good press it always does but it will also make them wary of you cause them to respect you and it will give you more clout in conflict situations i took that advice quite seriously and it proved correct thats just one example of the kind of practical help that he was able to give me i also solicited his advice before i met with president bush then presidentelect bush to talk about going to epa train encouraged me to try to obtain an assurance of access and also control over personnel appointments to epa and then i saw him socially also through that time because we would have dinner from time to time and in his capacity as chairman of world wildlife fund he would have me back for functions that they held i saw lee thomas just a few times i think and talked to him a few times on the phone he was constrained from calling me by the terrorizing ethics briefing that is given to an administrator before he leaves epa that makes clear that any initiative on his part to contact the agency to do anything could possibly result in his going to jail for it i dont think lee called me for two years i did call him occasionally and he was really an outstanding figure i think an underappreciated one who kept the agency together during a very difficult time and did it quite well epa has been very fortunate in its administrators it by and large is a classy group relationship with epa career staff q how did you go about establishing a relationship with epa career staff coming from a nongovernmental organization mr reilly when i went to assistant administrator for air bill rosenbergs farewell i can recall i believe it was rob brenner of the air staff who made a remark to me to the effect that you never made any distinction in your time between the political and the career people at the agency you took both of them into your confidence and all felt a part of the team i was very pleased to hear him say that because thats in fact what i tried to do i can recall one occasion when career staff kept me from doing something dumb when i became angry at the white house and considered acknowledging that in testimony and an air staff member advised no not before congress there are other ways to do that if you decide its a good idea i remember thinking later one doesnt rely on career staff for that kind of advice but they gave it to me and of course it was correct i felt they were quite protective of me and loyal to me i certainly tried to be both to them they gave good value consistently they were very dedicated very committed i must say they certainly belie the stereotype that much of the country has of the washington bureaucrat they worked very long hours and brought to their task a degree of sophistication about the interplay of politics economics science and health that made working with them intellectually very stimulating apart from all of the power we had apart from whatever impact we may have had on history in my time the experience itself of working with those people those men and women is one that was consistently exhilarating for me as far as my interaction with them i can recall early on having  or  troop into my office for a briefing and wondering whether this was costeffective in the private sector the meter would be running of course and it would be pretty hard to justify that i later came to conclude that it both was rewarding to them to see the administrator finally get the issue on which they might have spent several years of their lives and also was an extremely effective way of communicating within the agency it multiplied the people who heard the message directly and could repeat it so i used those meetings  often asking questions the answers to which i knew and probably more often asking questions the answers to which i didnt have a clue i also used to enjoy sometimes some of the old crocodiles there who had been around a while and knew all the answers watch me in a briefing just gradually come to some level of understanding so that i could ask a certain question and id almost see in their eyes oh good hes reached the primary level of comprehension here so well reward him with an answer we had a good humorous i think congenial relationship i came to respect them a great deal i think they understood that and appreciated it their largest deficiency was the result of their beleaguered history which had resulted in limiting their openness and involvement with much of the outside world with the most innovative segments of the business community and with other countries i tried to broaden their horizons and open them up a bit management style q how would you define your management style mr reilly my management style was to work very hard to ensure that i had the right people in the right jobs and that they understood me and how i like to proceed i believe very strongly in loyalty and in openness i have no patience whatever for backbiting or for staff working at cross purposes with each other i think conflict within an institution that itself is subject to a lot of exterior pressure and criticism can be very costly the friction costs of having a sonofabitch on the staff are very high and almost never worth it no matter how good the sonofabitch so i try to weed them out i like personal congeniality and smarts i really value frankness i try to make it painless for people to bring bad news to the boss and i often ask questions to elicit it to see if there is any even if its not brought to me i believe in delegation  really believe in it i think that people ought to be allowed to make mistakes and if theyre good theyll learn from them an agency as large as epa if it does not delegate will become very slow to make decisions and actions to the extent that decisions funnel up to the top they will get focus and highlevel attention and maybe eventually priority but they will also require time there is no way that you can put that many decisions on the plate of an administrator and expect the daily lives of americans to benefit from prompt solutions to their problems i believe that with respect to the regional administrators as well i was a little surprised frankly to find the degree of delegation at epa when i got there it is one of the most decentralized agencies of the federal government since youre dealing with so many locationspecific problems that is probably inevitable but it is unusual it used to be upsetting to some other agency heads or congressmen who didnt quite understand that a decision that they wanted to influence would be made in the field they didnt understand why i just wouldnt pick up the phone and order that something be done in a certain way well if you respected the structure that we had you had to trust it to produce the right consequences generally speaking i did and didnt interfere that much other than to ensure that the right criteria and priorities were being applied and the processes being respected in the field there were exceptions to that i reversed my regional administrator on the two forks dam i also withdrew authority from my regional administrator in chicago to oversee wetlands implementation in the state of michigan where i thought more discretion should have been given to the one state to which that authority had been delegated those were rare decisions quite unpopular in their regions  in some quarters of their regions reaction among the denver region staff to my action on two forks dam actually was mixed there were a lot of epa staff in denver who thought that was the right decision but there were some who certainly didnt finally i believe in a clear exposition of purposes and priorities to focus energies and to ensure coherence its also vital to morale and agency effectiveness for everyone to understand what the key objectives are i think my own management style is one of trying to create a sense of purpose and significance and even excitement and hoping that that will be infectious trying to dignify the effort which after all if youre protecting peoples health and their ecology shouldnt be that difficult and then letting good people get on with their work i necessarily had to protect them from the congress or the white house from time to time and didnt mind that they were worthy of it hank habicht q how did you and hank habicht carve out your respective roles as administrator and deputy mr reilly we came to a working understanding early on that on certain issues i would be very personally involved  certain issues that either i cared about particularly or that would not be moveable to the same degree absent the administrator those issues included the clean air act and controversial regulations the two forks dam decision the exxon valdez and followup wetlands regulation our international activities the north american free trade agreement and i suppose our food safety initiative there was nothing however that hank was discouraged from getting into i particularly encouraged him to get into the whole area of risk characterization and systematizing the way that we assessed risk within the agency he himself picked up on the management issue and became a prophet of total quality management he saw the things that i was not doing and was quick to pick up on them he and i met regularly  sometimes in meetings we set and lunches that we tried to hold fairly frequently weekly or biweekly other times just before our early staff meeting in the morning or after it or in the course of the day my door was always open to hank he just freely came and went there was nothing that we couldnt talk about he also had a very good sense of when to do something on his own and when to tell me he was going to do it and what those things were that he could act on with his own initiative and just tell me after the fact he knew my philosophy and what i cared about i thought we had one of the most congenial administratordeputy relationships i had ever seen that owes a great deal to his sensitivity too i traveled a great deal i probably traveled a third of my time i think my predecessor told me he averaged one day a week out of the office i probably averaged two hank was quick to pick up the loose ends that necessarily got left and generally make sure that our agenda was moving forward he made sure the initiatives that he knew i cared about were getting a proper degree of attention and prioritythat the white house was being mollified or snags that came along were addressed it was a very easy relationship we saw the world i think quite similarly  the needs of the agency both the importance of protecting its regulatory integrity of restoring to some degree its public image of really strengthening internal morale which had not been great throughout the s and of leading some reforms to introduce more science and economics into agency thinking he had had more experience than i with the programs having been assistant attorney general and so often knew more about specific issues than i did but was always very modest and unassuming about his knowledge i think in retrospect he was a very astute observer of what i was not doing and was quick to pick up on it and do it in some cases i encouraged him to take on certain things in other cases he just recognized that they needed doing and did them it was fundamentally a relationship built on a lot of mutual respect agenda q you talked about your agenda and you set ten goals or themes when you first came to the agency how did you come to choose those particular themes to concentrate on mr reilly well some of them i thought were relatively obvious i have a long history of promoting nonconfrontational consensusbuilding solutions to environmental problems the time was right for that the adversarial approach has been very costly to this country and to the extent that you can find ways that do not frustrate the fundamental objectives either of the regulated sector or the publicatlarge and some of their interest groups environmental organizations and others that makes sense hence my emphasis on voluntary programs the incentives to pollution prevention the safer pesticide initiative the  program green lights the environmental leadership program and design for environment all of those things that reward good behavior rather than simply punishing bad behavior were i thought the kind of things that bush put me there to do he mentioned my history as a conciliator and as someone who tries to build bridges across the divides when he swore me in the international agenda was something that mattered personally to me a great deal i thought that the united states could be of enormous help to the rest of the world for very little outlay in an area where we led the world at a time when other countries were beginning to address a backlog of environmental problems so that initiative seemed logical to me the elevation of ecology was something that i cared about and it was also a recommendation of the science advisory board i thought frankly that a major priority epa had been conceived to uphold of protecting the natural systems of the country had been somewhat diminished historically in favor of protection of public health and i wanted to restore that balance two forks served that purpose very well so did our national estuary program and our aggressiveness on wetlands and my proposal for a world convention on forests we increased the annual budget for regional areas  for the great lakes chesapeake bay long island sound san francisco bay the gulf of mexico  from  to  million plus our budget for wetlands went up very considerably there were a number of reasons for that one frankly was that people care about even love some of these places the chesapeake bay or the great lakes they dont love emissions controls or effluent limitations or reducing parts per million of benzene its very hard to communicate some of those things to the public as it is to the president its not so difficult to communicate what youre doing to protect the chesapeake bay and why that matters even though it may all go to the same purpose thinking in terms of special places forces you to integrate things so it also served another one of my priorities which was to promote crossmedia attention to problems i had become concerned that in the fragmented history and congressional oversight structure of the agency we had built walls between our treatment of air water waste and the rest we didnt have the authority to break down all those walls because the statutes are different the traditions are different the expectations and requirements of the laws are different even the risk methodologies are different but some of those by heaven i thought we could break down the risk assessment methodologies was one of them and we did we tried to get the same risk characterization for air as for waste as for pesticides or at least to clarify when we werent and why we werent the environmental equity priority is one that responded to a growing concern that was very deeply held by a lot of poor people and a lot of minorities in our country  by people on the indian reservations and in the urban ghettos and in some very poor rural communities there is a sense and its true that these people suffer more environmental assaults on average than those who live in affluent neighborhoods to some degree this is a consequence simply of purchasing power and we cant protect against it entirely the land values will be lower and so rents will be less in places where air pollution is more severe but to the extent that waste facilities really are sited where political clout is least and where people are most powerless or have the least capacity to understand what they are getting which has been true of some of the indian reservations i thought that was epas responsibility to get into even though we didnt have location control authority in most of our laws so we took that on seriously and i think moved it forward the concept of applying risk to our laws was simply the outcome of a lot of thinking that had gone on and was popularized first by bill ruckelshaus particularly that we needed a language that was common to the agency and would allow us to prioritize better than the kind of episodic political noise that accompanied the discovery of the valley of the drums or love canal and that typically set the agenda and determined priorities it was a necessary template i think to apply to environmental priority setting in the united states it was also a good shield with which to defend the agency when charges would come up that one or another of our responsibilities was not being kept or some milestone was missed if we could say we were attending to the important business as determined by the scientific community based upon their assessment of comparative risk our priorities complemented one another they stood together ive been pleased that they havent been undone by my successor some of them have been renamed but i think they are still going forward i believe i like to believe at least that we won the adherence of the professionals for those priorities that we legitimized comparative risk assessment and marketbased programs like pollutionrights trading and also the voluntary programs on our watch we spent a lot of time thinking about total quality management tqm and how you improve service and morale how you improve quality of regulation and of attention to the regulated sector to clients so to speak in a service institution there was a good deal of skepticism about that but i think by the end we had made some inroads so many people had had tqm training and had begun to see that its really just another name for common sense and respecting your peers and not duplicating effort and delegating when you can and not doing things more than once i remember we had one senior prioritysetting meeting in maryland where there was a revolt against my having laid on too many priorities linda fisher told me a story not long ago of my smiling when this point was made to me by some hapless candidate who was chosen to come forward with the bad news  this is a case where i certainly didnt punish bad news i just didnt believe it i didnt really agree with it in my remarks i said there will be more initiatives this is not a custodial era in epas life there have been such eras but we enjoy a moment of opportunity that must be characterized by creativity and imaginative new ideas therefore it makes sense for us to have these initiatives and i dont promise there wont be more linda said i put it less graciously in a note that she saw and that i had given to gordon binder my chief of staff when i left the room on that occasion the note she saw he showed her read kick ass and take names gordon there will be more initiatives well i have always believed that the agency has been strongest most effective also most exciting to work in when it was moving forward when it had ideas when it was making policy when it was promoting and initiating and framing the debate and not reacting thats what it seemed to me the times called for and we had an opportunity however brief to enjoy it thats called rising to your moment october   risk assessment q it occurs to me that in the s a number of environmentalists were concerned that risk assessment was a means by which industry watered down environmental legislation watered down environmental mandates  ive read some material that seemed to imply that what changed during the s and then during your tenure in the later s that made risk assessment something that the agency was using to further its environmental mandate its environmental goals mr reilly there was an attitude towards risk assessment and still is in some environmentalist circles and in some parts of the congress some important ones that regard risk assessment in about the same way that the traditional environmental establishment regards dilution as a means of pollution control that is you work down to the level at which you will tolerate death and disease and set a restriction there set a tolerance or a pollution standard there that isnt too costly i can recall during the thomas administration at epa there was a very negative exchange on public radio as i recall where someone alleged that at epa people were actually trying to calculate the number of acceptable deaths due to a particular carcinogen the attitude reflected in that radio programs excoriation and caricature of thomas approach to risk posits the possibility ultimately of zero risk and regards zero risk as the ideal towards which we should work that has tremendous appeal there is no question but that one would like to live in a society that is riskfree or at least render that part of it to which we are involuntarily exposed free of risk  the chemicals that come on our food the pesticides that are used on products that we consume the air that we breathe and the water we drink i think that the concept of risk assessment and then risk management that is of trying to determine a level of practical achievable control gradually gained currency as a consequence of two things first of all the agency dealt with many more problems than it used to as a consequence of a whole plethora of legislation that was added to its responsibilities in the s and s  the toxic substances control act the resource conservation recovery act the superfund law the result of this was to cause even the most idealistic and protective of epa staff to realize we cant do it all we have got ourselves even to make some allocation of our resources given the fact that theres more for us to do than we can do the congress never came through with sufficient funds nor did administrations typically request them truly to allow all of the responsibilities carried by that agency to be borne secondly the technology of detection advanced very significantly within a space of a few years we went to the possibility of detecting not just parts per million but parts per billion and even in some areas parts per quadrillion as detectable though admittedly trace amounts of particular chemicals this began to pose the problem of as senator moynihan once said to me well knowledge is sorrow really to the degree that we understand that there are trace amounts of carcinogens on our food from pesticides or even in natural products like coffee or peanut butter we ourselves have to acknowledge that we are making these choices and tradeoffs of the kind that the public radio criticized i think this throws everything into somewhat greater relief it certainly requires a more mature accommodation of reality it also reminds us that some of these pollutants are facts of life they are in the environment many of them irrespective of human alteration and manipulation ultimately you will find for example arsenic which is a naturally occurring phenomenon in common food products once detection is finetuned enough that forces you to acknowledge that what you need is some reasonable method for predicting levels of real impact on humans so that you can protect people to an adequate standard the ideal is to ensure through regulation that such inevitable risks are negligible ie that they would not over a lifetime of anticipated exposure in a real world situation result in more than one excess cancer death in a million people zero risk is a chimera a beckoning illusion to try to achieve it would consume unjustifiable amounts of resources and entail forgoing much progress tolerating a certain trace level of pollutant in certain circumstances is more than offset by gains to health that you can get with the freedup resources we have probably way overemphasized cancer for example in regulating for pollution control in the united states to the neglect of things that cause neurotoxic problems in fetuses developmental problems brain development concerns that have nothing to do with cancer i think that when you realize that in some instances you would be better able to protect society against a larger problem in gross if you didnt deploy a disproportionate amount of your resources on what is a much smaller problem it causes you then to get into the realm of risk assessment and risk management the regulator then is in fact however doing nothing different from what you and i do every day we decide to walk as opposed to take the car someplace or ride a bicycle or maybe do something a little more dangerous like ride a motorcycle or scuba dive the difference of course is that some of those risks we choose for ourselves there is a popular preference that government should try to absolutely eliminate those risks we do not have direct control over that people dont voluntarily choose it cant be done risk assessment i think has gained currency as a consequence of a very large set of responsibilities that forced prioritization secondly the discovery that we cannot provide perfect security for everyone at all times again as senator moynihan once put it well life really is about risk and it ends badly ecosystem management q using risk assessment opens the door to dealing with ecological risks overall instead of just the howmuchpesticidedoyouhaveonourapple sort of thing and looking at your tenure it seems that the agency moved more and more towards an ecological approach maybe an ecosystem approach of environmental management it seems to me that the agency has come full circle in a sense in that it inherited certain organizations like the federal water quality administration in the s that had been doing watershed management for many many years  and moved towards that endofpipe approach and more industryspecific approaches  and now its moving back again towards ecosystem management why do you think its come full circle that way why do you think it took  years or  years to determine that maybe this ecosystem approach or watershed approach was truly valuable mr reilly well the environment is a matter of more than health health certainly is very important but the concept underlying the establishment of epa was the environmental protection agency it posited an integrity of our natural systems of which we are a part and said to keep an eye on all of them i think that the agency has placed the emphasis in different areas at different times but certainly in the latter s the emphasis shifted to health its difficult to argue against emphasizing health however the consequence of that i think was to create a certain imbalance in the agency we in my watch tried to reassert the priority for ecological systems particularly in view of the fact that the best scientists we could consult who make up the science advisory board told us to they told us that some of the major threats to the environment in the united states were in fact ecological  upper atmospheric ozone depletion climate change forest fragmentation species loss  all of these properly the concern of an environmental agency like epa we didnt however for a moment have the kind of budgetary resources deployed in accord with those priorities sab said raise the ecological priority of the agency it was a very welcome message to me i went into the agency believing that was important to do we strengthened the budget for special ecologically significant systems like the great lakes and estuaries and wetlands systems i think there is a second reason however for attending to ecology as compelling as it can sometimes be to talk about health we have provided a very high degree of health protection for the people of the united states in my view the health of our citizens has improved significantly over the life of epa  not certainly as a consequence only of what epa has done but of what it has improved you cannot say the same thing about a number of ecological systems certainly through the clean water act expenditures we have vastly improved some of our major water bodies particularly the great lakes we still do not have a handle on nitrates in the chesapeake bay nor nutrients in the long island sound we have substantial areas that are dead in those water bodies forty percent of the gulf of mexico shellfish beds are off limits at any one time because of pollutants that flow off the land that really has always struck me as scandalous i dont think we will be able to say in the popular phrase of the moment that we have attained a sustainable level of development until we function in harmony with these ecosystems and learn to keep them productive the public gets that i think to a surprising degree one problem epa has always had particularly when its communicating about health and pollutants is a difficulty making clear to the public what the issue is we complicate that problem ourselves by developing language that is so opaque as to defy penetration even by some specialists and often i think has led the public to think there is something that is going on here this is a trick to keep us out of the game we are not nor ought to be fundamentally about reducing this effluent or that emission but rather about protecting the totality of the environment if you talk in those terms and identify places like the chesapeake bay or the san francisco bay or the great lakes people get it those are the places they love thats the way they understand nature the outdoors the environment so its a way to reach the people and engage them in your work i always felt that education about the agencys mission about the state of the environment about the choices the country had was among the highest priorities i respected and the language to communicate about the environment is in my view more properly ecological than health thoughts on abolition of ceq q ceq has played a predominant role in protecting areas at least geographically  by focusing peoples attention on ecological management in these areas through nepa using environmental impact statements and that sort of thing you have no doubt heard the clinton administration wants to abolish ceq set up a smaller office in the white house and then transfer  depending on which day you listen i guess  those functions into epa whats your opinion on that mr reilly this nation and this government so badly needs systems that integrate a variety of policy concerns that different agencies have that i consider it a profound mistake to eliminate ceq many of us worked for years to try to get an understanding of the need to have better coordination for environmental protection which after all involves your reaching out to agriculture interior commerce hud and other agencies ceq can do that thats its very modus operendi thats the concept under which it was established epa can try to do it and has to do it sometimes but as one more agency and not even a cabinet agency at that its a little more difficult there is a provision of the clean air act section  that gives epa the right to involve itself and make judgments about other agencies conduct and behavior its not a very popular thing when epa does it and yet an agency in the white house that both has crosscutting responsibilities as part of its charter and also is free of the daytoday administration of the laws to look longterm is i think a very important asset to presidents who want to use it the problem ceq has had is that presidents have neglected it its not been given the kind of role that it might have unfortunately the bush administration chose not to put into ceq some of the major environmental issues that in the nixon administration would have been lodged there such as the coordination of wetlands policy to have given that kind of issue essentially to the competitiveness council in my view foreordained the kind of acrimony ideology and conflict that we encountered its not sufficient simply to set up a ceq and assume that it will have the kind of influence that the statute contemplates the head of the agency has to have a relationship with the president has to be able to influence other white house officials and has to be deferred to by the president in a way that suggests that they are to be taken seriously but if you have that and we certainly had it in the nixon administration and also i think in the carter administration with the kind of work that was done on the year  report whether one agrees with the conclusions or not that is a classic achievement of a white house council charged with taking the long view and looking beyond the turf of any one agency with ceq gone where is long term forecasting to be done i dont think that moving some of those functions directly into the white house into the domestic policy council or the domestic staff of the president is a sufficient or reassuring replacement for ceq they will be more political they will be more subject to other pressures directly in the white house they will be more episodic in their capacity to identify issues and characterize them and focus attention on them as they do or do not get a priority from the president even in the time when it might be in the desert so to speak as an agency in the eyes of the chief of staff or the president ceq nevertheless has its nepa responsibilities its statutory functions its responsibility to report on environmental conditions and trends its interagency coordination role  which in our administration it tried to exercise with respect to water contracts for example and i thought made a contribution i dont believe its a good idea to eliminate ceq and transfer the nepa oversight functions to epa epas relationship with natural resourcebased agencies q with regard to the idea of crosscutting and maybe epa not being quite the place to do that in government how would you characterize during your administration the agencys relationship with other natural resource based agencies in the government  agriculture department interior department and the various bureaus beneath them mr reilly we had excellent relations with the two agencies that epa ordinarily conflicted with the corps of engineers and the department of agriculture particularly during the first two years of the administration the assistant secretary of the army for civil works bob page was very sensitive to environmental concerns courageous in the face of criticism he received from people in the white house and in congress for taking wetlands protection responsibilities seriously constructive in working with me and others concerned about wetlands as a result i thought we had a relatively contentionfree period and were able to make some progress the same was true for the agriculture department under secretary yeutter he and i early on worked on the alar issue and both of us came to see that the pesticide law was flawed what the agriculture department really wanted in the way of a new pesticide law was uniformity of application so that we wouldnt have  states going their own way setting different pesticide tolerance levels i thought that a reasonable proposition provided that you are dealing with chemicals you have registered recently  that have been subjected to all the modern scientific testing so i conceded that point in return for the agriculture department supporting me in getting a cleaner faster cancellation authority than existed under current law presently absent a very high standard of emergency the epa administrator after years of research and analysis can start the process of removing a chemical from commerce but even after the decision is made at epa and it goes out of the building it is subjected to de novo administrative hearings and then inevitably judicial review all over again which can take    years that is profoundly destructive of public trust and confidence in government when you realize that the cancellation decision is based on a considered judgment that the chemical causes a problem  it has carcinogens at a level that is intolerable how then explain why youre allowing it to continue to be used yeutter understood that and so together we proposed pesticide law reform we were not successful because i think in the absence of a decision overturning the delaney clause which since has occurred the house agriculture committee particularly saw no urgency it was not unhappy with the pesticide law conservatives did not want to increase epas cancellation authority and liberals did not want to abandon the delaney clauses zero carcinogen prescription for processed food in favor of a negligible risk standard which we also were proposing as the national academy of sciences had recommended one thing that triggered i think a readiness in the bush administration to support reform was my own position after alar that i would not again stand up and reassure the country that the food supply was safe when epa had acted to remove a chemical unless we could promptly get that chemical out of commerce that was the position i and many of my predecessors had been put in after making a cancellation decision i just said next time i wont do it yeutter also embraced epa and environmental concerns in the preparation of the  farm bill he was very clear with me early on he had encountered an unprecedented amount of concern for the environment as he made the rounds of his senate confirmation committee members and he said that was a big change since he had last been at usda he realized that our support for any farm bill would be important to him it would matter to senator leahy the chairman of the senate agriculture committee and others he said in return for our giving that support he was willing to pull epa right into the process have us as central participants which wed never been in the evolution and development of the farm bill as a result we got the most environmentsensitive farm bill wed ever had so our relationships were very good they were not as good after secretary yeutter left and then the recession began to hit and there was a greater concern for the politics of the environment and a sense that the issue wasnt playing as well for the administration as it might have our relations with the interior department were i think on the whole congenial i got along personally with secretary lujan very well we as he often pointed out had different constituencies and were responding to different groups which he characterized as clients i thought that the fish and wildlife service and the park service relationships to epa on wetlands and air pollution respectively were very successful and productive in the evolution of the clean air act secretary lujan reflected a point of view of concern for coal contracts and for the developmental side of his brief which i think the president and others fully understood he would in making him interior secretary we all understood that and accepted that we did have a serious disagreement over the endangered species act i thought one could make a case for systemic reform of the act but not for exempting application of the law on less than  acres of oldgrowth timber in oregon which was habitat for spotted owls i thought the suspension of the endangered species act for that small tract was purely symbolic and negatively symbolic it was something that was not going to preserve or create any jobs and was unlikely to destroy any owls it simply was firing for effect i angered a number of people in the administration and probably secretary lujan when i chose to be the only member of the team who voted against in public the suspension of the act in that case but given the kinds of issues that epa has i thought our relations with other members of the cabinet were generally surprisingly cordial we fought very hard with the energy department on specific clean air act implementation regulations and that received some publicity some attention and yet there was much less attention paid to the fact that i had an excellent relationship with secretary watkins as did my staff on cleanup of federal facilities  at least after we got over his anger at our criminal investigators having broken into rocky flats one night without having warned him he and i agreed early on that he would support my proposal for a millionton sulfur dioxide reduction in the clean air act in return for a concession he wanted which was to grant an extra threeyear extension for clean coal technology which i did i thought by and large those relationships were probably less troubled than they had been in previous epa administrations  largely because the president had campaigned on the promise to be the environmental president and had shown by a number of decisions early decisions particularly that he wanted the issues and me and epa to be taken seriously his coming to the agency headquarters building the first president who ever did to swear me in was a very important gesture it wasnt lost on anybody the number of senators the number of members of congress the number of ambassadors who were present im sure to some significant degree because the president himself was going to do the honors helped us a great deal epa and congress q how would you assess your relationship to congress mr reilly i had a relationship with congress that i thought was productive in some areas certainly in the senate more than in the house when you consider the controversiality of some of the things with which i was associated the clean air act reauthorization wetlands reform resource conservation recovery act testimony superfund testimony those are very difficult issues and i thought the senate environment committee the senate foreign relations committee and then appearances before the senate finance committee and the senate labor committee on the north american free trade agreement  though there were rocky moments  by and large were congenial respectful and productive my relationships with the house were very good with the waxman subcommittee although obviously i was in the position very often of defending the competitiveness council or other things they despised we had a professional relationship i had a good working relationship with henry waxman and with the ranking republican norm lent that survived a particularly difficult clean air hearing where they tried to position our clean air act as unaggressive i had a good relationship with the house foreign affairs committee and with ways and means which i testified before on the north american free trade agreement and other house committees there was a great deal of tension in my relationship with chairman dingell that really dated almost from the beginning i came from a sector the organized environmental community that he detested i also had associates like bill rosenberg with whom he had a history and not a good one he simply didnt like the kind of environmental priority my appointment represented nor did he find the clean air act as we submitted it a good bill in the waxman subcommittee of his committee it was pushed even farther in directions he didnt like and i think he considered we didnt help him enough in holding the line against some of the things he cared about to protect the auto industry and manufacturing sector we had different roles and i was probably less attentive and artful than some of my predecessors in managing the personal relationship with him  though i did try a number of times he thought that i tilted towards the senate on the clean air act and i think i probably did because they returned my phone calls and didnt regularly go around me to the white house i had conversations with senator chafee and senator mitchell and senator baucus throughout the deliberations as i did with congressman waxman but mr dingell and i and his staff were less frequently in communication he tended to call the white house when he had a problem with us on the clean air act or with me i didnt react well to that either i thought ultimately looking at the clean air act we got that relationship worked satisfactorily for me but it certainly left some scars you dont serve in a position like mine where youre not just custodial where youre not just reactive without making waves and without causing people to become angry from time to time thats the nature of the job there is very little that an epa administrator does that confers an unqualified good on somebody at least of an immediate perceptible sort a decision to have a new nox standard for automobiles obviously will help the public good will improve the chesapeake bay as we get nox deposition down and improve our environment all around but the immediate recipient of the problem and the entity that bears the cost is the auto industry which is not going to look very favorably on that thats true of virtually every decision the epa administrator doesnt go around handing out funds for housing projects or developments or enhancing a national park or paying for airports or roads or clinics we just have to accept that and hope that in spite of the contention and costs that are associated with epas decisions the public at least trusts both the laws and the integrity of the people who administer them to take the right things into account that is one reason i gave so much attention to communicating about what we were doing i thought that was a real need particularly coming on the heels of the reagan administration which had a rocky start on the environment i think its true for any administrator that sometimes one is tempted in washington to spend a good deal of time in congress that in my view for the head of an agency unless there is an immediate legislative issue pending can be a mistake can be a distraction its a very large country and the congress is important but the rest of the country needs attention too this anxiety that americans have about insiders i think is exacerbated by agency heads who dont get out and around the country to communicate to pick up things that you only get when you see things first hand once we had gotten the clean air act through frankly my relationship with congress was one of holding the line we had no other major legislative objectives im sorry to say that we were able to further in the latter two years of the administration if things had been different and wed had a new clean water act proposal then we would have been spending more time on the hill but the opportunities were not there at least from  on after signing the clean air act and i think some in congress felt neglected theyd been disappointed i recall when i testified on rcra and essentially stonewalled and said we didnt have a legislative proposal and we thought the legislative proposal they were considering was bad there was a lot of disappointment senator baucus said he really would have liked to have the same relationship on rcra reauthorization as we had on clean air i also noticed that when i made some specific criticisms of his pending bill there was more sadness than annoyance on that committee as they thought look what poor bill is now having to carry up here now and represent in fact they were my own views but the white house by then had so engaged the environmental issue in a negativeseeming way it was more difficult to communicate a position that said youre going too far with this law and to be believed stagnation of epas legislative proposals q what stalled epas legislative proposals mr reilly i think certainly governor sununu and probably the president concluded that the clean air act which was a marvelously comprehensive and ambitious bill with a great deal of innovation hadnt worked politically during the  months that bill was pending we heard regularly how pusillanimous it was and how inconsequential it was and reactionary it was  all caricature in fact of the bill we forwarded to the congress as we costed it out the bill would cost something between  billion and  billion per year when fully mature in terms of new added cost to the economy the bill that was reported out by the senate environment committee we costed at  billion to  billion per year and therefore we saw the need as senator mitchell understood to pare down that bill to put it in the realm that we could support and justify for the health and other benefits we would get from it we did succeed we got it down to  i think it probably costed out at about  billion as it was finally passed thats a big ticket that itself is a measure of seriousness our bill as we had proposed it wasnt far from those costs but during the long period when we were in negotiations to scale back the cost of the senate committee bill we were criticized and positioned as naysayers finally when the bill was enacted and signed mr waxman said this bill is owing to the two georges george bush and george mitchell  a generous thing for henry waxman to say and it was the truth yet neither he nor anyone else on that side had said anything positive about the presidents contribution for the better part of a year and a half so that was credit that was too late in coming i think the white house decided environmentalists were not going to work with us were not willing to give credit to us as they might have to a democratic administration for an initiative of that magnitude and we wouldnt do that again certainly there was a sense too that those costs were very significant we just got the bill signed when the economy began to show some of the first signs of distress dick darman related those economic problems to the clean air act he never lost an opportunity to disparage it to say the only possible conceivable reason for having done it was to gain a political advantage but in fact it had not done even that the failure of the clean air act to work politically for us weakened my position in advocating new environmental initiatives it reinforced the arguments of those who disdained environmental initiatives as likely to alienate traditional republican interests without winning any new support from activist environmentalists so from a political point of view i think that the environment could have worked better for us if wed had a more forthright response on the part of those who set the tone for the environmental debate to a large degree the organized environmentalists but also the press in fact lee atwater told me after i had been in office less than a year that the country regarded us and the president as very serious about the environment as he put it our polls show that the country considers bush an environmentalist but he aint nuts well thats exactly where george bush wanted to be so we were succeeding in the longer term and i think had we been more careful with the rhetoric had we not engaged in the fights on the specific and many of them relatively trivial regulatory issues like the minor permit amendments and then had we not had the big public wetlands fight and had we positioned ourselves as leaders and not become isolated at the rio conference we could have come into the  elections as serious responsible people who really had done a good job of integrating economic and environmental priorities we could have achieved that reputation in spite of the activists brickbats but too many of the people around the president were only too ready to abandon the environmental standard and were reenforced by environmental groups criticism omb and the council on competitiveness q what role did omb and the council on competitiveness play in epas life during that time mr reilly in the era prior to my arrival at epa omb was a thorn in the side of epa for its constant involvement in regulatory decisions david  stockman when he was director of omb made it a matter of great personal interest to engage specific regulatory choices and argue against epa proposals dick darman did not really intrude much on our regulationsetting unless some issue happened to get to the competitiveness council where he could be counted on to weigh in so we didnt have that kind of highlevel conflict by and large i thought we were able to work through many if not most of our regulations with the omb process reasonably well that was not true of a relatively small number which got a large amount of public attention i think as much for the way the issue was framed and dealt with by omb as for their substantive view it is profoundly frustrating to an epa administrator to go through all of the careful control processes of arriving at a regulatory decision or proposal and to respect all of the rules against ex parte contact  make sure any contact with the regulated community is recorded noted memorialized public on the record  and then to have it go to the white house and see many of the same parties engaged in influencing other people who have influence over such decisions without any public record without any acknowledgment that this is going on the secrecy that characterized that process i think is a source of great mistrust and potentially of corruption corruption in the sense that it violates process not that it involves anyone taking any money the competitiveness council was layered onto the socalled office of information and regulatory affairs oira review when the president became distressed about articles in the wall street journal and other places indicating he was reregulating society and repudiating the reagan era reforms  the deregulatory priority which he himself in the reagan era had championed as head of a regulatory review task force he had espoused the clean air act and also the americans with disabilities act so it shouldnt have been a surprise that there was a spate of new regulations to implement those laws epas contribution to regulations was in fact relatively small something like nine or ten percent of all regulations were epa regulations but they tended to be some of the more contentious regulations and to get more attention than those of other agencies the president gave to his vice president just as reagan had given to him the responsibility to get a grip on this so vice president quayle wishing to carry out his assigned task engaged some of these questions i thought myself the way they were engaged while it was guaranteed to attract attention for the administrations deregulatory concerns was not the most constructive way to vet an issue the councils selection of issues to make a stand on also i thought wasnt the best the minor permit amendments issue was essentially a legal issue  when a pollution source wished to increase its emissions by up to  tons beyond the maximum allowed in its permit did that trigger a requirement for a full public review with a hearing or not had there been an interest in the competitiveness council in avoiding a train wreck on that issue we would have been able to do it by an early referral to the attorney general i dont think there was that interest i had a memorandum from my general counsel basically boxing me in saying that the approach that the competitiveness council wanted was not a lawful approach well once i had that i didnt have a lot of flexibility finally after months and months of wrangling and public wrangling at that congressional hearings and the rest the president made a policy call and resolved that as a policy matter he considered that the competitiveness council was correct ie that no hearing was necessary the chief of staff and others in the white house thought that should be the end of it and didnt fully grasp that lawfully legally i had the statutory authority and the president didnt i recall explaining to chief of staff sam skinner that i would respect the presidents view on the policy provided that i could be authoritatively assured that such an approach was lawful absent an opinion from the attorney general i said i would decline to sign a regulation waiving a hearing requirement the white house got an opinion from the attorney general fairly quickly which said that the competitiveness council was right on the law and my general counsel was wrong that provided the basis for accommodating their view and then of course well only know what the truth is after its been tested in court the announcement of our final position on the issue was frontpage news in the new york times and occasioned a lot of negative publicity so much so that president bush asked his counsel boyden gray who put me in the middle of this gray told him it was the vice presidents staffer mcintosh a lot of that i thought unnecessary there was a certain amount of posturing i think to make the case to that segment of the country that was concerned about reregulation the reagan republicans that we were taking their concerns seriously we were not reregulating society the wetlands issue also engaged developmental interests farmers groups and ideological conservatives it was perhaps a natural for a competitiveness council headed by a conservative to latch onto we at epa successfully held the line on our wetlands delineation despite very tense battles over it we repeatedly made the case that there are only about  million acres of wetlands left in the country and its inconceivable that wetlands restrictions could be having a deleterious effect on the economy of  billion privately owned acres as some of the critics alleged had that process been on the record had it been more open had it been less political had the bases for disagreement been reduced to writing in a communicable publishable form i think we all might have come out better but in the end the specific impact of the competitiveness council on regulations i think came down to two or three not more one was the decision to forego recycling as a requirement for granting permits for new municipal waste combusters incinerators epas proposal was intended to ensure that certain kinds of waste not go into incinerators waste containing heavy metals such as batteries a condition necessary to qualify for a permit to build an incinerator was to be a commitment to recycle a quarter of municipal waste and to exclude batteries altogether from the waste stream the proposal was opposed by cities and by senate democrats such as senator baucus the cities resented what they saw as intrusion and overreaching by epa baucus considered recycling inappropriate to pursue as a clean air act matter i thought you could make a reasonable argument for or against the proposal the president was in favor of recycling i espoused a national goal of  percent recycling of municipal waste and the objective was achievable but in deference to the critics and frankly to give the vice president a win on something i withdrew the proposal so that became a competitiveness council victory the minor permit amendments was the second one the other great battle that we had wetlands which was a sort of soap opera throughout the administration was a standoff we did significantly strengthen the enforcement of our wetlands laws put people in jail for the first time in history for violations of wetlands laws and increased the number of civil actions and fines substantially that no doubt contributed to the backlash but we took our wetlands responsibilities seriously they were in my view part of the ecological priority we had espoused in sum the heavy press attention to the competitiveness council agenda was reassuring to an important element of the administrations constituency while epas aggressiveness in carrying out the law honored the presidents commitment to be the environmental president epa and the press q how important is the press and the public to an epa administrator you mentioned before that a few negative articles coming out on the bush administration in the wall street journal had encouraged the president to take a different approach on matters are a few negative press articles an important gauge to an epa administrator on how he or she should develop policy what role does that play in decision making and policy making mr reilly ordinarily i dont think a negative article or two makes that much difference to a specific decision but we all swim in the same sea the level of public and congressional confidence the degree to which the white house begins to develop an impression that maybe somebody is off the track or is not serving the president well or is pursuing a different agenda does matter its more a cumulative thing than anything else there is no question that the ability to communicate what youre doing in that it has to be mediated by the press will have a lot of impact on how much you can do i felt that from the beginning and gave a very high priority to communicating about our activity i was also sensitive to the fact that i came to the bush administration as an outsider i had no relationships of a political nature with any of the key personnel i had scarcely known the president before he appointed me and in that sense lacked a constituency my constituency had to be the country environmental groups made clear in the clean air act debate that they were not going to be a constituency though they were generally constructive and positive towards me and helpful they mattered less to the administration as time went on and the administration gave up on ever winning them over or cultivating them but the general good will of the public the belief on the part of people including the congress that we at epa were doing the right thing and sometimes even beleaguered standing up for principle was very important to my continued capacity to do it i had the feeling that we had really succeeded to a substantial degree in improving understanding of some of what we were doing when i having canceled most food uses of the pesticides known as ebdc chose to put ebdc back into commerce a couple of years later after we got better data about its residue level on fruits and vegetables in the supermarket ebdc was indisputably carcinogenic in very high doses and there could have been a very nasty reaction to repermitting it a lot of epa staff were hunkered down preparing for the hurricane a decision like that had not been made before in announcing the cancellation of  or so food uses of ebdc i had said that our data was worrisome but also incomplete and i mentioned that there were some in the agency who suspected that residues detected at harvest in the field would quickly evanesce as fruits and vegetables were handled time passed and they were moved from the field to the dinner plate if that proved true i had said i would go where the data went well i did do that better data was developed through an elaborate survey and i accepted it and reversed my position thereby allowing the food uses the press reaction was largely accepting and trusting though reporters asked hard questions at the press conference and there were some environmentalists criticisms on the whole given the precedent i was setting and the nature of sensitivity for something that was after all in very high quantities a carcinogen the reaction suggested a growth in maturity of understanding about scientific information and about the concept of negligible risk i thought that reaction was a measure of the degree to which the press had become more knowledgeable since their experience with the alar controversy i think some people in the press thought they had been had and maybe had overreacted to alar and had panicked the country and harmed the apple growers unnecessarily but that new sophistication didnt just happen i spent a lot of time with the press i had been totally forthcoming about our risk assessments whenever i announced a regulation i freely discussed our data on cancer deaths associated with a toxic or costs and benefits of a regulation etc when i suspected that data would have to be subject to reconsideration that it was necessarily flawed because we didnt have all the information i acknowledged that too whatever we had i shared the press developed a habit of asking for that information  how many cancer deaths are associated with x y or z pollutant how many will you avert by this decision how many are you accepting sometimes they would ask about the maximum exposed individual cohorts that we were protecting to one in  one in  one in a million i saw sophistication grow on the part of the press of an area that has to be conceded to be terribly complex my sense of the press is very positive i think reporters have a very difficult job to do i am amazed that sometimes ill turn on the television and see a perfectly clear straightforward chemical explanation of an extremely complicated process such as stratospheric ozone depletion or climate change i think the press is communicating about the environment better and better although there are shortcomings and the people in the press will be the first to admit that they often dont have the training whether scientific or economic and often dont have the time either but one thing they ought to have is enough time on the part of people in positions like the one i had or others around him to help them understand the issues because ultimately if they dont understand them the country wont either epa oversight q it seems that the press and congress both have done a lot of oversight of epa in the past i think of congress in terms of superfund issues and the contracting issue was a major blowup during your  thats probably the wrong word but it appeared to be a major blowupduring your administration do you think those types of concerns  superfund contract management pollution prevention those types of issues  were adequately addressed by epas various congressional and press constituencies mr reilly well the contracting issue is one that i think is a consequence of a number of things one of which is that the priorities within the agency itself have always favored programmatic environmental protection decisions the management questions in an aggressive agency just like in an environmental organization have a habit of attracting less prestige epa has the defects of its qualities it is zealous highenergy highly committed idealistic engaged  its not one of those agencies where as you walk through the halls you feel the adrenalin flowing out your shoes there are several ive discovered but epa is not happily one of those but it also is fair to say that there is the tendency and has been historically of some in the agency to behave like environmental cowboys ready to ride off to round up the latest errant steer identified by the press or the congress not incidentally enjoying the budgetary reward that may come with that momentarily the responsibility to manage daytoday mundane activities like contracts even in an agency where a substantial amount of work is done by outsiders because congress doesnt give enough money to the agency to do it otherwise gets neglected i think that has been a problem with epa we gave the correction of those problems a very high priority to keep things in perspective the kinds of contracts were talking about are small beer alongside the defense department and the energy department equipment contracts for waste cleanup for example nevertheless theyre important and public trust has to be maintained and the dollars securely husbanded and accounted for having said that i think its important also to acknowledge that those who have a habit of pointing to epa management problems failure to meet milestones failure to get regulations out on time or complete reports according to the statutory deadlines or contracts management issues often have a larger agenda than merely pointing to that kind of problem to the extent that the agencys own conduct is discredited it becomes more difficult for the agency to advocate new initiatives stronger laws or to advance its own agenda in reforming policy it becomes easier for some regulated sectors to stonewall or to overcome the agency by raising doubts in the mind of the public and elements of the congress as to whether the agency can handle added responsibilities whether it can even do what its been given the job to do thats all part of the game and i think the epa leadership needs to remember that funs fun and when there is an honest criticism it ought to be taken seriously and responded to but protracted attention to some of these issues in a billionperyear agency to the neglect of much larger problems in other agencies tells you something its part of a lightning that is falling on an agency that is doing its job and doing it vigorously epa is an agency that is doing its job very vigorously no other federal agency in recent history excepting nasa in the latter s has succeeded so spectacularly in achieving the goals set for it global political changes and epa q during your tenure you saw radical global political changes what impacts do you think those global political changes had on epa mr reilly with the waning of the cold war the global political situation changed fundamentally while i was at epa in my view it accelerated a process that was already underway of opening up a whole new world to the agency  a world that desperately needed the experience of epa which is preeminent in its field internationally a world that needed help in setting priorities in gaining a sense of direction that needed also frankly to learn from american mistakes particularly since many of the societies most in need of help dont have the resources that the united states has we tried to respond to that by making the agency available to eastern european countries and former soviet countries we set up the budapest center which was an epa proposal that i made to the cabinet and the president before he went to hungary  later known as the bush center we worked with the world bank i made the rounds to a degree in fact that i doubt any of my predecessors ever have to the interamerican development bank to try to foster debtfornature deals with latin america to a meeting with the president of mexico on debt for nature and to brazil to meet with their cabinet on a number of issues particularly leading up to the rio conference we had a very active international agenda and the president made clear that he thought environment as a matter of foreign policy was important that we should attend to those issues secretary baker was always friendly toward our being involved as well there was a sense i think  certainly i had it  of much heightened environmental possibility as a result of the waning of the cold war the freeing up of resources the relief of tensions and anxieties the ability finally to communicate honestly with our russian counterparts with whom we had had a bilateral agreement for  years but who had nevertheless withheld a lot of information we made a real start toward exploiting that opportunity in the process we secured for the agency a role that it had not had before we had the presidents support in this and we experienced occasional tensions with the state department  not unmanageable ones but tensions nevertheless i hoped very much that in my time i would be able to institutionalize a high level of international activity and priority within the agency by creating for the first time a senateconfirmed assistant administrator for international activities i strengthened that staff and moved its complement towards  staff members i created environmental attaches in paris at oecd and in mexico with our embassy there and we had plans to have attaches in moscow and tokyo and i would have liked to have one each in china and perhaps taiwan and south korea and maybe thailand these latter are doing a great deal of environmental investing and locating our people there could have served more than an environmental purpose it could also have furthered the export of us technologies in the area of pollution control in a time when billions are being spent by those countries we played a role in the development of the enterprise for the americas program the debt for nature concept was our idea for each of the g summits of leaders of the seven major industrial nations i briefed the president and secretary of state on the environment the president took me to his first g summit in paris  an unprecedented decision by him to have an environmental minister with him which no other head of government had ever done or has done since all of this elevated our role our profile as i watch now the degree to which international environmental responsibilities have shifted to the state department im concerned that things that only epa can do effectively will not be done the role of an epa administrator in dealing with environmental problems along the border for example cannot be assumed by a commerce secretary or even an undersecretary of state should the question arise are we adequately protected against cholera outbreaks or whats causing these brain stem disorders at birth of some of these border children youre not going to have a commerce secretary or an undersecretary of state taken seriously on those issues no matter how good they are that is something that epa has the authority and competence to address and the country will want to hear from the epa administrator it makes sense that epa be in the drivers seat on the border plan therefore thats true of many other issues as well i think frankly that it would be healthy and its very healthy for the agency itself to encounter environmental problems in other countries because it lends a sense of perspective to our own problems and allows epa professionals to recharge their batteries and to become reinvigorated and to recognize what theyre doing theyre doing for the whole world its a noble enterprise and theres nothing that brings that home to people more memorably than to help another country figure out what to do about its waste problem which is an order of magnitude greater than ours or its air pollution problem which is actually killing people and causing lung disorders in front of you another advantage it has frankly for an epa administrator or at least had to the two presidents whose administrations i served nixon and bush is that it gives you something to talk to the president about now there are those who say that bill clinton is different and maybe he is but my experience is that you dont talk for too long about sewers or the clean air act or superfund and hold a presidents interest but if youve just come back from a meeting with mrs thatcher or youve had a long conversation with helmut kohl and you communicate that in a memorandum youre likely to get invited over for a meeting or maybe even for lunch with the president and show up on the presidents calendar this being the city that it is that is noticed and that will fortify you in other difficult battles with other agencies as your relationship with the president is respected that may sound a somewhat narrow and selfserving kind of interest but in fact its part of the way the game is played and i think it will ever be so finally we now understand that many of the most important decisions affecting the future of americas environment will be made in beijing delhi and brasilia those countries decisions regarding energy policy or manufacture of ozonedepleting chemicals or forest practices we will want to influence an internationally active and helpful and sophisticated epa can do that november   epas relationship with industry q were down to talking about industry what goals did you want to achieve in dealing with industry how did you balance the need to get industrys support and cooperation with the need to enforce the laws and generally how would you characterize epas relationship with industry during your tenure mr reilly i had the sense going into epa that the relationship with industry had been episodic and at times less productive than it could have been it seemed to me that the better more sophisticated industry leaders understood that the nations environmental commitments were here to stay that the support for the environment had stayed high in the polls that even through the recessions of the s and early s there had been no rollback in air and water law moreover i thought that business leaders calls for less bureaucracy more efficiency in permitting more predictability in administration of environmental laws on the part of epa were reasonable i immediately found myself in dealing with the alar controversy faced with the asymmetry between the chemical industry  the manufacturer of alar  and the agricultural industry  the farmers and growers of apples who were people really hurt by that scare i tried to get voluntary cooperation finally succeeded from the manufacturer though epa didnt have sufficient statutory authority to compel it i think my next encounter with industry was over the exxon valdez issue where we dealt with exxon which substantively did very well in my view in responding to the cleanup once you got beyond recognizing that inexcusably no one was prepared for it in public relations terms however i think exxon lost the war their chief executive officer ceo was so aggressive and conveyed such an odd sense of victimization on television and publicly that it set the company back more than it might have i did learn from those experiences and tried to be careful particularly in crafting the clean air act to consult with industry and did so with the oil auto and chemical industries particularly those relationships had their ups and downs i think the chemical industry relationships were largely quite good in my tenure at epa i viewed them as having become quite progressive even some of the companies that had been laggards in the s like dow became leaders in the late s and early s i dealt extensively with dupont on the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons of which they were the largest manufacturer i had good relations with some of the oil company leaders in fact i supported development of a project to review the amoco refinery at yorktown to test the longstanding arguments of engineers that more environmental quality could be achieved by paying less attention to specific emissions and effluents and more attention to total plant impact on the environment the project proved that hypothesis correct that project had some rocky moments epas philadelphia enforcement people with exquisitely poor timing went after amoco and slapped a big fine on their yorktown refinery i had to recuse myself from anything affecting the decisions on enforcement and call up amoco ceo larry fuller and ask him to keep amoco engaged that was not easy to do the  fine enraged amoco people as bad faith but fuller responded to me and we kept the project on track i can recall dealing with various of the industry groups which i made a point of talking to regularly right from the beginning i had them in along with everybody else i talked to trade associations talked to the electric power people about the acid rain provisions of the clean air act which were very upsetting to them i dealt of course throughout my term with the coalition that industry had put together on climate issues i think given the nature of the history and the inherent adversarial character of a regulator dealing with regulated entities we had a reasonably good relationship i suppose the auto industry probably would not consider that i was as responsive to some of their concerns as i might have been the industry i thought in various ways failed to perceive and act on its own interests it left too much to its congressional spokespeople in washington but by and large i think the clean air act worked well for the auto industry it was the first such act that had ever focused on fuels and that asked as much of the fuel suppliers and manufacturers as it did of the automobile engine makers the auto manufacturers should appreciate that our new emphasis on fuels was an acknowledgement that they had already cleaned up their cars to the point where new  cars were about  percent cleaner than they had been  years ago with our clean air act we moved that another  percentage points up but looked to changes in the composition of fuels to achieve additional pollution reductions pulp and paper which had a bad enforcement history was very constructive in my view in dealing with the dioxin issue in terms of researching the question jointly with epa and in terms of getting dioxin releases way way down about  percent in our time i believed very strongly that because of the leadership that was in industry and the sense that environment was a concern and real commitment an enduring concern of the american people that we could craft a different kind of program in response to that it would draw out the energies and creativity of industry to help solve problems rather than just simply have them fight us and so i proposed the volunteer programs  to reduce toxic emissions   toxics by  percent by  and  percent by  the response to that was enthusiastic companies chose the means and achieved the first goal a year early eliminating  percent of these critical toxics by  im sure they will do better than  percent by  companies routinely took credit for that in their annual reports they wrote me letters proudly touting their achievements they emphasized them with their workers and stockholders and others in every way the participating companies demonstrated a capacity to go beyond the law that is admirable in the process they learned some things technologically which helped them save money make money reduce pollution and allowed epa then to understand more about possibilities of solving problems cooperatively in fact a not very widely understood purpose of the  program was to educate the epa workforce that at the same time and without compromising either your regulatory responsibilities or your enforcement responsibilities you can work cooperatively with people who most of them have the same objectives you do and you can learn from them incidentally no conceivable regulation would have allowed me to obtain elimination of a third of the worst toxic emissions   million pounds  in little more than a year the other programs the energy star computers program which awards recognition to computer companies which reduce by about  percent their energy needs environmental leadership program design for leadership program which builds on  to craft a new relationship with companies that have demonstrated they deserve it also saving on oversight on the part of epa the green lights program that gets commitments to reduce energy use very substantially without any loss in quality using new lighting technologies the safer pesticides initiative that puts applications for nontoxic pesticides at the front of the line for registration  all of those were part really of a new generation of environmental policies and i think a new direction that the country badly needed the united states has a distinctly adversarial concept of environmental protection it is in my view excessively adversarial it has been wasteful of time and money we have it in everything from rule makings to cleanup i wanted to change that and i hope that i laid the foundation to do that the regulatory negotiations proved very popular the ones that we did with industry and that represents a new mode of determining what a regulation should be we did one on fuels and we did one on ethanol  unfortunately had to repudiate that in the heat of the  electoral season those negotiations were constructive and were welcomed by all the parties with one possible exception the office of management and budget which has never liked them its unfortunate that that is true but omb believed and probably still believes that a regulatory negotiation to the extent that it unites all of the participants around a single regulation dilutes the single omb representative and prevents omb from having another bite of the apple which it likes to have when it reviews regulations i think that is very shortsighted and turfconscious but it happens to be the omb attitude toward consensual regulatory development i think regulatory negotiations are extremely productive at getting a result that works for everybodywhere people dont hold back their best ideas so they can litigate them later where you have a regulation promulgated that will in fact be the regulation is not contested or litigated permitting the regulated sector to invest on the basis of it we dont typically get that four out of five regulations signed by an epa administrator are contested in court regulatory negotiations are not that points to a different kind of relationship it points to the kind that we need and the kind that i think we demonstrated is possible so i feel quite good about the relationship finally that we built with industry i simply hope that it endures state and local governments q william ruckelshaus in a recent oral history interview mentioned that sometimes state and local governments saw epa as a gorilla in the closet that helped them regulate industry within their constituencies or within their areas but sometimes they found that epa was a gorilla that leapt out of the closet and beat them on the head as well for their pollution problems  a case in point being a couple of enforcement actions that ruckelshaus took early in  against various big cities for municipal waste pollution into various rivers what would you say your administration did to address the legitimate concerns of state and local governments and how would you characterize that relationship generally mr reilly we gave a high priority to decentralizing a lot of our activity epa was frankly more decentralized than i realized it would be when i arrived at the agency but that is a response to the complexity of the country and the nature of environmental problems which differ one place from another we consulted very closely with the governors with the western governors association with whom i met at least twice with the national governors association with whom i met regularly and saw them as partners in the enterprise i particularly valued their contribution at the beginning of the statutory consideration in the congress for example of the amendments to the safe drinking water act on which the governors had very strong views i remember saying to the governors dont wait until we come down with onerous regulations which are the consequences of the statute we must administer to complain about it work with epa when were trying to head it off in hearings that was less successful than i would have liked governors like the rest of us look at whats on the front burner and the problems they have at hand i think one of the most important contributions though that we made to state and local relationships was to do a review of all the many requirements that affect localities and put them in a single large book which is a very thick book then we recognized that the local officials especially of small cities and towns who must administer these requirements and who often suffer great liabilities as a consequence who have to sign off on hazardous wastes as being properly handled and monitored for example are quite frequently unpaid sometimes theyre teachers plumbers electricians working part time one has to ask why should they do this why should they take responsibility for leaking underground storage tanks which are complex and technical and can open them to liability have we got the right way of interfacing with them have we made services and technical advice available to them of the sort that they need municipal liability for superfund sites threatened to bankrupt governments in new england california and other areas i tried to promulgate a cap a maximum percentage of cleanup costs beyond which municipalities would not be liable the white house blocked that initiative i recall senator rudman saying to me once and it made quite an impression i dont care what the law says i used to be a federal judge and no federal judge is going to order durham new hampshire for example to spend more on a superfund site than it spends on a school system i guess i would add to that nor should it i think some of these things have to be kept in perspective so we did attend to the states concerns and needs we tried to reduce the number of standards that we were promulgating under the safe drinking water act every three years im very pleased to see my successor has continued that direction we tried to reduce the number of tests that they must conduct particularly for things that arent used in their states i recall carol browner then florida environment secretary saying that under the safe drinking water act  drinking water tests were required in florida in one year we tried to recognize that there is more on the plate of states and localities than they can possibly manage to the extent that we put it there as duplication of an effort well take it off our total quality management efforts were intended to relieve states of a lot of second guessing and oversight and unnecessary duplication that effort in my view did not go far enough on my watch i think it should continue and given the very sorry plight of some of the states fiscal situations such as california new york and others and all the other burdens they bear theres really no excuse for doing things twice i remember in thinking about state relationships having a very difficult time with our chicago office when they attempted to deny a permit for a golf course in michigan that would have altered the environment of an undeveloped area that probably we all might prefer to see remain pristine essentially denial of a permit to develop a small amount of wetlands to a developer who was prepared to restore significantly more wetlands in return was asking the wetlands program to bear a large burden michigan was the only state that had received delegated authority under the  wetlands program to make such decisions and in my view that entailed authority to make such decisions free of secondguessing by epa epa should not secondguess each permit decision in such a situation but rather should annually review the states administration of the program as a whole the agency wasnt doing that it was essentially behaving towards michigan the way it behaved towards every other state that is to monitor and review every single permit and overturn overfile on those that it disagreed with i finally withdrew wetlands regulatory authority from the region for the oversight of states that had delegated programs i was hearing from florida and other states that had considered applying for delegation that the michigan case proved that you get nothing for it so why take it whats it gotten michigan the opposite argument to that is that the threat at least of intervening with respect to a specific permit will keep the game honest will keep the state with a believable sanction in the event it gets under strong political pressure to grant a permit will allow the state to say epa will never permit it theyll come in and disallow it whereas the sanction of epa will remove program administration authority from us is less plausible certainly more remote from an individual decision i recognize that reality but tend to think given the resources we have more deference to state decision making is appropriate i believe that is a consequence both of the way we crafted our federal system and also of the increasing sophistication and technical ability of states i think my view of that is probably not the majority one at epa which has a habit of secondguessing to a considerable degree there are some statutes like the clean air act that really contemplate that approach but where that is not the model thats in the law i would opt for a greater degree of deference to state decision making i think the governors understood that some of them respected that and our relationship was therefore pretty good my relationship with the mayors and the county officials was quite good when i made the promise to reduce their liabilities or cap them under superfund but when i couldnt deliver on it im not sure how i ended up with them i did myself in conjunction with the attorney general bring lawsuits against odd municipalities for failure to enforce pretreatment requirements for water toxics under the clean water act that strained our relationship certainly with those cities some of them like detroit which were big it was however a critical area of water quality enforcement the absence of pretreatment means the whole system breaks down because waste water treatment plants cant handle toxics it is in the tradition of epas vigorous enforcement consistent with the enforcement record we had which set records for criminal and civil actions  in fact involved more of both than had characterized the previous year history of the agency i think our relationships both with industry and with states and localities ended up pretty sound tribal governments q what about tribal governments mr reilly i am very proud of what we did with tribal governments i took very seriously the laws treatment of tribes as states and proceeded to delegate real authority to them when we judged they had the technical capacity to exercise it not all tribes do some do more are getting it i particularly was proud of delegating water quality authority to the pueblos of new mexico a group of  or  which i visited which clearly had the requisite expertise and capability and were threatening to impose some fairly large costs on albuquerque by requiring much better water pollution control on waters that then flowed through tribal lands i can recall a visit to a newspaper in albuquerque where i was questioned quite strenuously on this point and simply said that the tribes under the law were entitled to this authority they had been getting water delivered by albuquerque that was unacceptable and they ought to exercise their power to get albuquerque to shape up but i said that they were not stupid and they were not obviously going to shut down a city of  or make it spend a billion dollars on water quality cleanup i thought the indians would behave responsibly but that albuquerque had better take them seriously that was my objective and i think thats pretty much the way it turned out the tribes have a huge amount of land in the united states i was startled to discover how much land they have there has been a tendency for waste to go their way and for some of them to accept waste in return for contributions to their needs i think to be consistent we have to respect indians rights to make those decisions and if they wish to have a solid waste landfill on their property provided they have the capacity to make a judgement about it and monitor it and control it and oversee it thats their prerogative not everybody agrees with that but you cant have it both ways you cant both defer to their authority and their expertise and legal power that they exercise provided they meet a certain standard and say not so fast when they want to use it to accommodate a waste facility i remember getting an award from the tribal groups and i thought we advanced the ball in recognizing the growing maturity and responsibility of tribes in the united states national debate on the environment q you spoke on occasion about starting a national debate on the environment what exactly did you mean by that and how successful do you believe epa was at doing that mr reilly i saw my role at epa as involving a large amount of education i believed that the environment was not a widely understood area of public policy there was a tendency to present it in primitive ways that seemed to me no longer conformed to the realities the characterizations so often in the press are of white hats and black hats thats the only way to make the issues come alive and be interesting this approach neglects the critical contribution of science in helping us understand the nature of threats risks of the proportion of problems some of which are more serious and enduring than others it also neglects the economics which is important not because some things you wont do because they cost a lot of money but because when you do them you will have to realize that there are other things that you cannot do money is limited those kinds of disciplines have never been acknowledged in the national debate about the environment so we had two major reports that we conducted one was the science advisory board report that resulted in the document reducing risk that characterized the threats to the environment ranked them and then evaluated epas programs in response to them it concluded that while epas money was largely going for oil spills and hazardous waste major threats to the environment were in the nature of climate change species losses forest fragmentation ozone depletion indoor air pollution pesticide risk to the applicators of the chemicals i thought that was an extremely important debate i did everything i could to publicize that debate i asked senator moynihan to hold a hearing on it he did we got states to conduct their own priority reviews of comparative risks  those are going forward in half the states right now and i think that is very important the other major report we did was the cost of clean which is required by statute and that requires epa to look at public and private outlays on the environment and try to put a number next to them try to figure out what they are we did that and concluded that about two percent of the gross national product was being allocated to air water and waste control  leaving aside parks forest and wildlife we also did something else that had never been done before with such a report we projected out to the end of the decade where that number would go and concluded that it would reach about three percent of gnp largely as a consequence of the costs entailed in hazardous waste clean up and particularly federal facility clean up i thought that an important thing to do because it did put in perspective us efforts relative to those of our major competitor nations very few of whom are spending anything close to what the united states is spending i tried to use both science and economics to frame issues for example about the future of superfund or the new directions in the resource conservation recovery act making the point that so many of the proposals made and under consideration in the congress would in fact cause these outlays to be even higher even though experts do not consider that hazardous waste represents that significant a threat to the health or environment of the american people it had in fact been overestimated as a problem i think that growing environmental literacy among the press and in the congress is very important to the future of environmental policy the degree to which epa is sensitive to science and economics will make the important things that we do more enduring will give them greater credibility over the long term with the public at large the environmental cowboy ethic which is a part of epa and is part of our history and our lore and is fun is just not enough to give the country the kind of environmental policy its going to have to have if these outlays are to be maintained and if the significant problems are really going to be addressed i think that there was more understanding of the priority question of the comparative risk way of thinking in the congress and in the press certainly when i left than when i had arrived so frequently one hears in the congress now how big a problem is this relative to other problems how much money are we spending on it versus some of the other big problems that we may be spending less on is it worth it in proportion those are absolutely the right questions to ask and i think we encouraged people to ask them that way epa and environmental groups q why didnt environmental groups give you one of their own the support that you might have expected mr reilly environmental groups behaved towards me personally in a fairly generous way a positive way i was always conscious of the distinction many of them made between me and the white house or me and the administration there were times when i regretted that i couldnt bring more support to the president when he was doing things they really should have liked i particularly was disappointed at the reception to our clean air act proposal by the clean air coalition most members of that coalition acknowledged that bushs was a very progressive bill they had not expected a bill aimed at eliminating ten million tons of sulfur dioxides in the acid rain title for example even though thats what they had advocated and thats what they got they nevertheless for tactical reasons in order to move the bill further in their direction on ozone reduction chose to characterize the administration bill as weak for the better part of  months the environmentalists caricature set the terms of the debate when the bill came out of the senate environment committee it was going to impose an annual burden on the economy according to epa and omb calculations of about  billion to  billion when it matured after  that was unreasonable so we spent some months negotiating with senator mitchell senator baucus and others to pare that back and did finally with the great help particularly of senator mitchell we got the annual endstate annual costs down to about  billion to  billion no small amount i remember the league of conservation voters scored all the key votes trimming the expense of the bill and they penalized senator chafee senator baucus senator mitchell and other people who worked things out with us the senators who negotiated cost reductions not only important to the administration but also vitally necessary to ensure enactment by the full senate saw their environmental ratings plummet as vote after vote on the environment committees bill was scored against them the senators who saw their previously outstanding environmental ratings drop to  or even below included several of the senates environmental champions that experience showed that environmentalists were out of touch it showed that they had allowed their ideology to run away with them also the habit of negativism of reflexive antipathy that had characterized their relationship with the reaganbush administration unfortunately carried over to the bush administration even though our initiatives particularly during the first couple of years were strong  on legislative initiatives like clean air and food safety most notably in the farm bill on budget outlays and on important regulatory calls such as my veto of the two forks dam but environmental groups did not credit or acknowledge most of those strong environmental initiatives they were however very supportive of my two forks dam decision the reasons for that are complex i think habit really explains some of it vice president bush had been a part of the reagan administration and there was a lot of distrust of the continuing figures and faces who survived and who were important in our administration environmentalists clearly understood that the president had made appointments designed to tilt one way at the interior department and another way at epa and they saw very little change at interior from the reagan era although the budget for land acquisition at interior was much higher under bush there was the body language of chief of staff sununu and budget director darman which was unfailingly skeptical about environmental initiatives and unnecessarily provocative to environmentalists it pointed up an ideological division even when there wasnt a substantive conflict between me and epa and the white house the white house particularly was highly ineffective in its public relations in dealing with the environment it was as though they were ambivalent about wanting credit on the one hand they resented when the administration was criticized by environmentalists but on the other hand they didnt want to claim too much for our environmental initiatives lest they upset the business community and the more conservative elements of the constituency the white house simply never resolved how it wished to present itself on the environment finally i think the president and his advisors decided that politically the environmental issue was too costly and was not working for the administration there was too little positive coming back for all the initiatives we were making the summit of the leaders of the industrial countries in paris in june of  was the greenest summit ever held and we the united states were responsible for it being green i was the only environment minister who was there accompanying a head of state and yet the environmental community used that occasion to complain that we hadnt set targets for co reduction i can still recall the sour expression on president bushs face when a reporter at the final press conference in the garden behind the us ambassadors residence questioned his saying that the meeting had made important strides on the environment thats not what environmentalists are saying she pointed out the president decided probably against his better judgment and instinct to close off most of the california coast to new oil and gas development and part of the environmental community hit him for it the sierra club criticized bush because his moratorium was not permanent but only for the remaining years of the decade thats the kind of stuff that we dealt with constantly there is no doubt in my mind that political partisanship played a role in the positions of many of the activist organizations in fact a majority of the staff at most of the activist environmental groups are democrats and the culture of these groups is democratic that is true even for the more moderate ones like world wildlife fund many staffers from the organized environmental community in fact have gone into the clinton administration activist environmentalists display great skepticism about republicans as the party of business and they perceive republicans as less prone to regulate than democrats they are less willing to be as generous or as tolerant toward a republican administration as they are toward a democratic administration however i can recall that president carter and his press secretary jody powell had their conflicts with environmentalists there is a newspaper headline i once showed our epa staff  white house to epa shut up or quit it was in fact from a press conference that jody powell had conducted so one doesnt want to make too much of the partisanship of environmentalists elements of the carter white house fell to calling environmentalists  percenters people whom you could never please but i thought we deserved better of the environmental community particularly in the first couple of years than we got in fact it hurt the environment and it hurt our capacity to make further initiatives in the latter part of the administration that the rewards had been so few in the first part reorganization q since the s well since the s really ecologists and environmentalists listening to ecologists have looked for ways to make pollution control crossmedia so that by cleaning one pollutant youre not dumping it into another medium when you came into office at an event celebrating epas th anniversary a couple of former administrators said that you didnt need to reorganize the agency along crossmedia lines they counseled you against that and you seemed to have taken their advice what compelled you to follow their advice why didnt you reorganize the agency along cross media lines mr reilly there are a couple of explanations for my decision not to reorganize the agency and the most important and fundamental is reorganization involves tremendous costs in terms of time organization and momentum i didnt know how much time i had and certainly when i began to have some of the conflicts with the white house chief of staff budget director later with the vice president i thought my tenure might be short and i didnt want to sacrifice any of that time to reorganization the goals of crossmedia policy that i cared about i tried to achieve by making them part of my ten priorities at the agency by asking questions of our assistant administrators in a crossmedia way by having joint teams on a number of task forces and problemsolving exercises i think the agency got in the habit of thinking of itself more as a unit as a coherent entity concerned with the environment as opposed to air water waste or toxics raising the ecological profile also had that effect because the ecology is not something that allows you to segregate its the place where you see it whole my ecological initiatives for the great lakes national estuaries and the geographic initiatives i championed these all involved a cross media perspective to administer and we targeted enforcement priorities on cross media problems by requiring that a significant percentage of enforcement actions involve suits for violations of more than one statute when the problem posed is not this steel plant or that leaking dump but the restoration and protection of one of the great lakes it forces you to look at the problem whole to ask what is the most effective thing i can do to clean up and protect the lake one has to look at air water enforcement toxics voluntary programs and the contribution that all of them make thats just the way i like it one reason i like geographic initiatives and talked about them so much is because thats the way the world is and certainly the way the public sees it they dont see it in media compartments a second reason for not addressing the crossmedia problem by reorganization is that the reorganization would have to be very fundamental i think it finally should come but it should come as a consequence of a statute that integrates the various media i had such a statute terry davies had drafted one when he worked for me at the conservation foundation and i often discussed with him the possibility of just putting that out for comment trying to raise attention to it focus on it get the community atlarge discussing it he thought and most others thought that this was both thankless  it would have had costs in terms of threatening some congressional committees  and hopeless there was no way in the time we had that the congress was going to do anything about the crossmedia problem we set out to move the agency to a crossmedia perspective by the priorities we set the training and education we provided our staff and also through some very important and influential demonstrations we conducted the best known of these was the work we did with the amoco company at their refinery in yorktown virginia the analysis we jointly carried out there proved that by asking the question what is the best way to intervene in the process to improve the overall environment a better more costeffective reduction of critical pollutants can be obtained than by merely marching through the various media making emission and effluent reductions so i was never persuaded that reorganization is the best way to achieve a cross media orientation and im not sure i would counsel my successor to engage in much reorganization either obviously one can achieve these things differently perhaps more personnel movement within the agency is appropriate at this time given that theres been a lot of continuity for some time in some of the programs and it might be healthy to open them up a little bit get people into the habit of dealing with a couple of the media we did think a good deal about reorganization of the more modest but still important reorganizing moves i made i should mention that i established a new science advisor in the administrators office and created the post of scientific advisor to each of the assistant administrators and the regional administrators those obviously are integrating kinds of functions but i can recall talking to russell train before i even took over at epa who said reorganizations just mean huge interruptions of the forward momentum the progress of an agency and one has to have a very large reason to do that to an agency im conscious now what a terrific drain a change of administrations is the hiatus that occurs as you try to get new people in place get their names cleared by the white house get them investigated by the fbi get their names up to the congress and get them confirmed by the senate to add reorganization on that at the beginning of a term will leave you with very little to show for your efforts two years out you look at the current administration at epa and im often reminded by this time on our watch six months into our term we had dealt with the exxon valdez oil spill made a decision to begin the veto process of the two forks dam dealt with the alar crisis proposed new food safety legislation reorganized superfund and proposed a comprehensive new clean air act we also moved a considerable distance towards having a new farm bill it was a much faster start and undoubtedly some of the current slowness is a consequence of a change of administrations that involves more than just administration it involves a change of party with all new faces in the top positions and delays in identifying them and getting them confirmed the country does pay a price for doing things this way to add a reorganization onto that as an early order of business is essentially saying to the world were going to take two years off and rethink ourselves we hope youre still there when we come back i didnt want to do it frustrations q what were the most frustrating aspects of being the epa administrator mr reilly there are certain endemic problems that epa administrators cope with one is personnel i know going back to the beginning the white house tends to scrutinize epa personnel more than it looks at some other agencies i was told directly by the personnel director in the bush administration that no personnel appointments attracted more lightning than mine at the white house as a consequence after i got my first round of people cleared when a couple left i was not able to get anyone cleared or proposed to the senate again i had the people i wanted in the jobs so it didnt really matter much to me practically but i thought it was unfortunate for the people i had in acting status that they never were able to get formally confirmed as presidential appointees by the senate i think thats really a consequence of the nature of the business at epa its a hot spot it doesnt reward the white house much it seems to present many more problems more abrasive encounters than good news from a presidents perspective epa is just not a  feel good place the regulatory review process is a constant frustration for an epa administrator on the one hand the administrator has the authority to administer laws and to prescribe regulations however that is circumscribed by an executive order that requires omb signoff that creates a situation in which the agency is always explaining to the congress why it is not taking an action that may be called for on time by a statute while at the same time it is fighting on the other side with omb or the competitiveness council or its equivalent  there always have been equivalents  to justify the economic impact of a regulation and get the thing out as the law requires that involves constant negotiation and i suppose has proceeded more smoothly in other administrations than it did in ours we simply had an ideological chasm that divided me from the budget director for example and from the vice president on these issues president bush had advertised that he wanted to be the environmental president i thought that had certain consequences for the priority and aggressiveness with which we should carry out our functions i got the impression from the white house that a number of people had regretted the commitment and thought it no longer binding any more than the no new tax pledge was taken seriously by some of them those were the major frustrations there were also some frustrations with congress at times i remember testifying once on the reauthorization of the resource conservation recovery act on which we had elected not to play because the chief of staff just didnt see anything in it for us just didnt think we would succeed if we did i gave my honest opinions about some of the proposals then pending before the congress which would have significantly expanded the responsibilities of epa for regulating hazardous waste taking the amount of defined and regulated hazardous waste from under  million tons to over  billion tons as mining waste for example was added to the regulated mix i opposed that and gave testimony that was taken as very conservative i was conscious of the fact that first of all we were barely making any sense of the program we were administering secondly i knew that the appropriations committees had no intention of giving us any more money and third i considered that the risk posed by a lot of this waste did not warrant nationalizing the problem but the reaction on the part of some friends in the committee was to say poor bill look what theyre making him say up here i realized then the degree to which my position my capacity to speak and be believed had been compromised by the infighting that everyone knew was going on within the administration i could have been more effective on that and some other issues if there wasnt the sense that there was a war occurring behind my back that was not a new phenomenon with me other administrators had had many more problems of the sort that i had and yet what was distinct about my situation was that my president was the environmental president so there was the added note of disappointment if not perceived hypocrisy in the reaction of some of the proenvironment people in the congress they just didnt see the policy conforming to the promise that was a source of frustration and disappointment to me it didnt need to be that way we could have had a range of environmental legislative initiatives that addressed the water quality problem in imaginative new ways and that made sense economically in fact we could have achieved more reforms if our body language and our public presentation had been more forthcoming and aggressive if wed not created the impression of intense ambivalence about this area of public policy environmental philosophy q how do you define your environmental philosophy mr reilly my environmental philosophy fundamentally starts with a moral if not a religious conviction that we have a responsibility to maintain the integrity of the natural systems that sustain life the created order is itself holy in a sense and we as a part of it have an obligation one of the obvious and first obligations in any moral system is to sustain life protect life protect the underpinnings of life so i believe in sustainability or sustainable development to use the current phrase i have never considered myself a preservationist in the sense that i resist human interaction or intervention or even redirection sometimes of nature i am a humanist i believe in fact that humans have improved upon nature much of europe has been reshaped by a very sensitive system of agriculture that has been concerned with productivity over the long term the concepts of stewardship pioneered by the benedictines who developed new strains of grape and grains is one that i have studied and deeply admire before i became epa administrator i resisted calling myself an environmentalist because to me that had a connotation particularly with others of obstructionism of excessive preservationism of negativism of antigrowth of antigovernment antiindustry antibigness it neednt have that connotation but to a lot of people it certainly did i call myself a conservationist by that i mean someone more in the tradition of theodore roosevelt and gifford pinchot who believed that nature should support human activities and can be depended upon to do so provided that more is not taken out than is put back provided that there will be as much to support life in the next generation as there is in this one provided that if you view it as a banking account youre not always just making withdrawals i am just as concerned with poverty and the lack of development as i am with protection i believe that the wisest form of protection is in fact creation its not enough to put fences around places and try to keep people out of them one has to figure out a productive interaction that will make sense to people and cause them to think that their needs come first as they must i find the notion of people as a pollution abhorrent humans have evolved right along with the rest of nature of flora and fauna and intelligent life is the crowning achievement of the created order i believe both that humans are responsible for the earth and that were the best thing on it thats a somewhat conservative philosophy for a contemporary environmentalist after so many years seeing the press characterize me as an environmentalist and seeing that nearly  of the american public regard themselves as environmentalists i accept the term for myself but mine is i think a philosophy that can command popular support and thats realistic ive worked a lot in the developing world and one does not bring to problems there a priority that requires people to do without so we can keep natural systems healthy one has to craft a system that builds new economic structures that will be reasonably protective of natural systems but meeting human needs is the first priority if these are not fulfilled the system of protection will not endure rene dubos writings have influenced me i believe it was he who distinguished between the two traditions that have shaped western conservation traditions that began with two saints from umbria one is the tradition established by saint benedict who believed in shaping the land organizing it for agriculture benedictines introduced crops and vines and fruits as far north as scotland they were growers cultivators and builders they were also fine conservationists the other great umbrian saint was francis who was a preservationist really who preached the profoundest reverence for what in his time were seen to be perfectly useless birds and wolves nothing like him had ever been seen before in western thought the franciscan perspective has survived and come down to contemporary history through henry david thoreau and john muir in america and the benedictine world view traces to our time through thomas jefferson and gifford pinchot and theodore roosevelt i suppose i feel more comfortable with the latter benedictine outlook than with the franciscan philosophy simply because the wild world in which to apply francis precepts is so much smaller and more limited but both views are powerful and compelling and elements of both are necessary to a fully rounded conservation philosophy fundamentally i believe that creation is the most intelligent and enduring form of protection in terms of my application of that philosophy to my responsibilities at epa i tried first of all to cast the environmental issue in a new way i wanted to affect how americans thought about environmental issues to change somewhat their environmental philosophy to bring them to accept that regulatory priorities should be riskbased and sciencedriven i wanted those concerned about the environment to engage the broader world to recognize the vital relationship between environmental protection and trade i worked to promote understanding of the need to give the environment a much higher priority in us foreign policy for several reasons the necessity to have international cooperation in solving so many environmental issues important to the united states and also because if you truly accept the concept of comparative risk as a basis for setting priorities then you have to attend to the environment of the developing world where problems of health and ecological deterioration are egregious i stressed the need to integrate environmental policies with economic decision making both in the united states and internationally and i made the case that natural systems deserve as much attention as health advice to successors and public q what overall advice would you give your successors and the public mr reilly i can recall being at a senior epa staff review we had on the eastern shore of maryland when someone was delegated to complain to me that i was just imposing too many burdens on the agency too many priorities i remember responding to that in fact linda fisher assistant administrator for toxics and pesticides told me recently that she was shown by gordon binder my chief of staff a note that i had written and handed to him as i left the meeting where i had listened to that complaint the note read kick ass and take names there will be more priorities in my oral answer to that concern i used a little more diplomatic language i told the agencys senior executives that in the lives of organizations there are periods of retrenchment consolidation reaction and sometimes quiescence and there are also great moments of opportunity energy excitement and innovation i very much believed that during my time at epa we were riding a flood tide and that we had the obligation to make the most of our moment not knowing how long it would last or whether or when it would come again epa has always been at its best when it viewed its role as not just custodial but as cutting edge as formulating leadership as prescribing the answers to problems as directing to the congress what needs attention as communicating to the country what the big issues are and how they should be addressed one sometimes hears and some of the current administration seem to reflect this that it is the job of the agency to take congressional priorities and implement them lord that is just wholly impractical because congress has given epa totally diffuse and disconnected priorities theres no way that you can possibly respond to all or take them all equally seriously the agency is in a unique position to function as the conceptual cockpit for environmental leadership not just in the united states but in the whole world that is the role that i aspired to and i would encourage my successor to keep that standard high q what about the public mr reilly the public needs to see and hear epa it tends to respect the mission but has a fairly uninformed view of whats involved its remarkable how little the public understands about the environmental protection agency its not like the park service where the mission is obvious anybody who visits a park will run into a service that interacts regularly and directly with people education is a large and important part of the job it required a great deal of outreach a lot of attention to the message a lot of effort to cultivate the press and television and simply to explain i used to do a lot of that  not just why its more important to take my approach than someone elses but exactly what the nature of the problem is the issue itself  whether its the great lakes or the chesapeake bay or the reauthorization of the clean air act or the acid rain problem that impacts on the northeast or the consequences of our energy choices or the border problems with mexico the public needs constantly to be reminded of the fact that we all do make choices and many individual choices have consequences for the environment that people dont fully appreciate maybe we dont really want to change some aspects of our behavior  conserve water or have the car regularly inspected or carpool or refrain from developing our wetlands or leave our used oil at an approved collection center  because all these are inconvenient i used to talk about things like inspection and maintenance of automobiles something the public resists and that is very badly run in most states every buyer of a new car spends  or so on the pollution equipment alone on the computers catalytic converters and the rest and can lose the air pollution benefits of this investment totally by failing to maintain those systems the nature of wetlands is a subject i used to talk a lot about i seem to have hit the really popular programs hard eh it constantly amazes me that for  years at least american conservation groups have tried to publicize the very important contribution of this diminishing rich resource we have its importance to commercial fisheries and ducks and for filtering pollutants yet every wetlands fight we got into we at epa were on the defensive with much less public support than it seems to me the resource would warrant if it were better understood to me that is evidence of the need for more interaction more communication the public is smart i think that when they are exposed to this kind of information given the general positive feelings toward the environment they will get it they will understand to some extent they do and thats why you see support for clean air and clean water holding high but theres more to be done there the epa administrator is far more than a regulator and should see himself or herself as a major source of information of encouragement at times of inspiration for the public at large someone who is known is trusted can communicate  sometimes to reassure people about the safety of the food supply other times to raise a little hell because theres too much wasted oil being dumped down the toilets and down the drains and getting in the groundwater and finally into the bays and estuaries  its all part of the job significant accomplishments q you mentioned before an ideological chasm between yourself and the budget director etc i suppose historians will look at omb and epas relationship at some point in time and make judgments along those lines as you know youve studied history yourself those will go in cyclical arrangements but on what grounds do you think historians should judge your tenure at epa what do you think were your most significant accomplishments as administrator and what do you think were your biggest failures mr reilly i think the most significant accomplishments were  somewhat in chronological order i suppose  first the elevation of ecology and the signaling of the end to expensive and wasteful water development in the west which i think is the message of the veto of two forks dam second the elevation of science in the agency that came with the decision to commission the science advisory board to do its report and then to give so much attention and play and priority to see to it that its message was heard it began to affect policy third the enforcement vigor on my watch which was unprecedented in the number of referrals to the justice department for civil action and criminal cases we filed we assessed more fines during my four years than in the entire previous year history of the agency and we put more people in jail for egregious willful environmental crimes than in the previous history of epa fourth i would cite the effort to integrate environmental policy with our foreign policy which we began very early as early as the march  delegation that i headed to mrs thatchers conference on the ozone layer in which then senator gore was a delegation member the constant publicity we gave to the stratospheric ozone issue as a representative emblematic problem and the treaty amendments we negotiated phasing out ozonedepleting substances by  here the world economy was acting over many years in a way that was disturbing the fundamental life support system of the whole planet without any knowledge of the consequences of our actions and then we began to address and correct that problem internationally  in the only way we could in cooperation and concert with other nations we at epa tried to influence the lending policies of aid the training of the peace corps which we began to undertake the economic policies of the treasury department relative to the world bank and i introduced president bush to the concept of debt for nature and we succeeded in making it a major component of the enterprise for the americas initiative that the president proposed for reform of trade debt and environmental policies in latin america one of the great environmental challenges and dramas of our time is the highly contaminated state of the former communist countries epa played the key role in thinking through those problems and in setting priorities in conjunction with the world bank to help address them we proposed the establishment of the budapest center to take a regional approach toward eastern europes environmental problems and then provided a program director from our staff i think we laid the groundwork for a solid climate treaty in my view the united states could have committed to stabilize greenhouse gases and that would not have impinged on our economic success if anything it would have spurred us to identify more energy conservation opportunities which is good for our balance of trade and our overall environmental health in the united states but the climate treaty itself is a good basis for moving forward and if we have to as the science comes in to tighten the goals as time goes on making them more concrete and specific finally i take some pride in the proposal by president bush for a world forest convention which was an idea i first broached to chancellor kohl of germany prior to the summit of industrial countries in houston in  i asked his environment minister klaus toepfer if germany would refrain from pressing bush on greenhouse gas stabilization commitments in return for the presidents proposing a convention on forests a german government official close to kohl had said to me when i tried out the idea that the chancellor felt strongly about climate but that he was crazy about trees the g leaders committed to the forest convention and we worked hard to achieve it in rio the principles of forestry that the world community did agree to at rio is a long way from a convention on forestry but it does lay the foundation for the convention and one day it will come into being i believe we made considerable progress in cleaning up hazardous waste dumps and perhaps more important in laying out the considerations that should underlie the reauthorization of hazardous waste laws when the time would come to revisit those flawed statutes within six months of taking office we redirected superfund emphasizing enforcement first and new technologies as a result of the enforcement priority lawyers for responsible parties began to advise their clients to settle we had four years of record settlements during which fourfifths of all private party contributions ever made to clean up superfund sites were committed and during our final year we were averaging one cleanup of a superfund site every six days or  in our last year with the reducing risk report by the science advisory board and the risk characterization memo by deputy administrator hank habicht we laid the foundation for a thorough overhaul of the superfund program when the moment came for reauthorization guidance we issued directed superfund managers to adjust remediation requirements to future land use an important change necessary to reduce cleanup costs and return derelict properties to productive use i believe that we legitimized both the concept and use of risk assessment on our watch more than half the states undertook their own comparative risk studies after we completed ours we also designed and demonstrated the value of marketbased trading of pollutants in the acid rain title of our clean air bill which is now law i believed very much that an excessively adversarial relationship had characterized governmentindustry relationships in the united states and that it was impeding progress the many voluntary collaborative programs we launched several like green lights and  which were very successful responded to that concern they began to inculcate in our professionals a more sophisticated understanding of the possibilities open to them the sense that they could without compromising their aggressive enforcement responsibilities pursue cooperative ventures with serious companies and sometimes solve problems faster and more efficiently i think looking back the thing that i am proudest of is the fact that the country the congress and certainly the president thought we were on the level we were honest people who had a sense of the direction that we should go in and that the country should go in and we were competent and could be trusted its very important when you exercise the kind of power that we had at epa that you have credibility and that people  even smart and involved people cannot take the time to learn your metier  believe that youre taking the right things into account and you have their interests at heart i think by and large our public reputation was consistent with that idea if there were those who thought from time to time that we were too vigorous or perhaps not aggressive enough they nevertheless believed that we were serious that is probably the thing that i am the proudest of because i think its what epa most needed in my time in terms of my major failures and disappointments i think that the rio conference has to stand out as the principal one i can recall getting up as head of delegation to deliver the speech for the united states in rio and my heart just sinking as i moved toward the platform it was clear to me that this should have been the high point of americas environmental performance and leadership in the world we after all were the country that had done more to put the issue on the map to think it through to develop environmental impact assessment push clean air establish freedom of information and community right to know about toxic releases and advance pollution rights trading and so many of the cutting edge concepts of our time no other country had reduced its pollution levels so much or restored water bodies as we had virtually all the environment ministers in rio knew that nevertheless america was on the defensive isolated criticized for me personally it ought to have been the high point of my career and here i was heading the delegation which was widely seen as the malefactor the financial times of london reported my first press conference in rio with my photograph under the headline arrival of the archfiend in rio they then gave a quite positive sympathetic characterization of my performance but were unsparing in their presentation of the world communitys negative even hostile attitude toward the united states the administrations failure to commit the united states to stabilization of greenhouse gases in the climate treaty and then its abysmal oversight of the negotiation of the biodiversity convention left us alone and beleaguered at rio the administration was not sufficiently unified to make sure that the convention on biological diversity was wellcrafted and was one that we could embrace had we been with the rest of the world on those issues we could have led on many others at and prior to rio i regret that i didnt get more consistent and vigorous support from the white house in an area where i really had the presidents interests at heart the president was personally very attentive and kind to me and my wife  and so was mrs bush all of his public comments and many private observations that got back to me were enthusiastically supportive of what i was doing yet during the fourth year particularly he came down on the side of the chief of staff or the budget director or the vice president on some of the major divisive issues between epa and the white house and undercut his very good environmental record and made decisions such as those affecting the climate treaty that i thought made very little sense politically or economically i think his image as a master of foreign policy actually suffered at rio in ways that perhaps some of his advisors had never conceived  largely because they just didnt take the environment very seriously and they didnt think the world would either i remember the budget director said that our stonewalling and isolation at rio would generate one at the most two days of negative press well it was at least  days of worldwide press exposure and criticism from an environmental point of review we simply didnt recover from it and it became impossible to get the environmental record which is a very strong record in the bush administration before the public and the country that wasnt necessary i dont think that the conservatives in this country required it i dont think it really helped with that wing of the republican party and it hurt very seriously with others who wanted to see the united states constructively engaged with these problems  not necessarily doing extreme things about them but certainly working in concert with other nations to solve these problems and ideally leading other nations my other disappointments are related to that the constant bickering fighting with the white house distracted us from some initiatives that we could otherwise have undertaken we could have engaged in much more productive debates about the reauthorization of rcra formulated our own concept lobbied it aggressively as we did the clean air act and finally gotten rid of some of the dumber things in that law had we retained our credibility one has to respect the fact that we had not just a divided administration but we had a divided government i dont think anything we could have done would have won cabinet status for the agency the democratic leadership in the house simply was not going to permit that on bushs watch some in fact have admitted it since some like senator mitchell in the senate were large generous and thought that the agency belonged in the cabinet and were prepared to bury any partisanship to put it there we never got the same kind of generous outlook in the house there were some longterm critics of the agency like dingell who even in a democratic administration wont support putting epa in the cabinet but might conceivably be willing to defer to a president of their own party on something he felt strongly about so i regret not getting cabinet status but i dont think there was much i could have done to achieve that i regret not getting a new headquarters building this is one of the frustrations that my predecessors and i all suffered through epa headquarters was a sick building the very idea has a woody allen ring to it i never imagined that five years after i took office i would look back and see that congress has yet to approve our building and relocation plan i succeeded in getting the administration to agree to assign to epa the best building to come on the market on pennsylvania avenue since the depression as senator moynihan reminded me congratulating me that the president supported my position but i could never get eleanor holmes norton to sign off and she blocked approval of epa as the tenant by the house public works subcommittee on buildings because as she said at the time she thought that building too worthwhile to have people in it making decisions about sewers i would have liked to have a more productive relationship with a couple of key members of congress but actually the reasons for the animosities felt by some members had to do with our aggressive advocacy of clean air and our vigorous lobbying of the clean air bill that they found loathsome so thats not a failure really its simply a consequence of making choices and being active which im proud of overall my relations with the congress were quite good food safety legislation would have been good to get it was needed but we couldnt get the liberals to give up the delaney clause or the conservatives to agree to strengthen epas cancellation authorities so we reached an impasse now with the decision of the th circuit court of appeals overturning the agencys interpretation of the delaney clause there will have to be food safety legislation our setback will have proved to be temporary i cared a lot about the convention on world forestry and got the president to propose that at the houston summit in  with some of the g industrialized countries we did not succeed in getting the developing nations to agree to a convention though we did get a statement of principles on forestry which i negotiated for the united states in rio ultimately that will prove much more valuable than the convention on biological diversity which was almost too easy to get the developing countries to agree to because it asked so little of them the convention on forestry could make a very substantial difference to the conservation of a very large amount of flora and fauna that live in the forests of the world particularly in the tropical forests thats something for the longer term and i hope the clinton administration gives it a priority i suppose its come as a surprise to some that epa was so heavily engaged in that issue well i really did see the agency as the environmental protection agency rather than as the air water and waste regulator of the united states i saw my role as the chief figure in the field of environment in the administration certainly the agriculture department had little interest in the convention on world forestry or the statement of principles on forestry so the vacuum needed to be filled and i happily filled it but i dont think there is much we could have done that could have gotten that in our time the developing world just wasnt ready for it and saw our concerns as potentially encroaching on their sovereignty i saw their anxieties first hand and they were genuine india brazil china malaysia  they werent ready for it i certainly regret that the environmental issue didnt work to the presidents political advantage as i think it should have but on the other hand the white house itself is largely implicated in that i often had the feeling that probably all the heads of agencies must have that if only i had had more latitude to operate independently and to control issues and their presentation myself we would have done much better i started by thinking i was the only nonpolitician in the mix of bush appointees dealing with the environment i ended up thinking i was the only one with really much of a feel for the politics of the environment as i watched them bungle one environmental issue after another from a political point of view there was just this dependable and consistent capacity to make a silk purse into a sows ear when we engaged issues like wetlands or the clean air regulations with the competitiveness council the rio choices were a string of bad political decisions motivated by discomfort with the issue and ideological antipathy to environmentalism that ran very deep i think on the part of some of the principals and it led to failures that disappointed me but ultimately those decisions will not have any enduring significance because the underpinnings of the apparatus and the record that we set were very firm were very strong bushs environmental record is in fact very good as people will acknowledge particularly when they compare it with the clinton environmental record from the point of view of budget or enforcement or new initiatives it will take time to see that only the administrations own internal conflicts obscured that while we were in office it would have been possible to overcome the antipathy of some of the activist environmental organizations that communicate directly to the country by drawing on the credibility that we had that i had particularly with the press the people that covered epa for example or the white house press had we not been undermined so consistently by the competitiveness council and by the body language that was used to communicate about these issues so in a sense my perception of missed opportunities is more one of politics than it is of administration or of environmental performance where i think we actually did very respectably concluding remarks q in timing that question i didnt mean to end on a negative note but thats my final question do you have any concluding remarks is there something that in the past probably whats going to turn out to be seven and a half hours of tape beginning in july and ending finally here in november that you havent mentioned that you think is worth mentioning or that one of my questions hasnt addressed that you think is worth mentioning mr reilly you know there are so many areas of policy that we could go into in more detail but no i cant think of any questions you havent asked you really have covered it you know i think some people look back at our period and consider that we started so well and ended badly i find myself introduced sometimes as the voice that cried in the wilderness as someone who tried to be the conscience of the bush administration on the environment i went into that job with no illusions i knew all of my predecessors i knew how much conflict there had been and how many disappointments some of them had had in their times in fact i had many more than my share of good days i remember bill ruckelshaus said as he announced his retirement his resignation from epa that an epa administrator gets two days in the sun the day hes announced and the day he leaves and everything in between is rain that was not true for me i had a lot of sunny days and i owe them to george bush and to the relationship that i had with the president my relationship with him was more congenial much more personally satisfying i think than any of my predecessors had had with the presidents they served it resulted in much more achievement that it was less successful politically than it might have been is largely the consequence i believe of decisions made at the white house that i accepted at the time with a sense that they never involved any moral compromise but were prudential judgments on which reasonable people could differ pressures that i was subjected to i could resist and did resist when i thought they were improper and there were no recriminations for that it was a clean administration it was an honest and ethical administration although it is the new initiatives and controversial decisions that government officials make that receive most attention the life blood of the agency  percent of the things it does for the environment attract relatively little attention the permits that are written the approvals and denials of permission to fill a wetland or open a waste facility or set a standard or pesticide tolerance and the quality of the staff work that goes into such decisions  these are the principal determinants of environmental quality what really add up to the integrity of the operation with that perspective in mind it is thanks largely to the quality of the people who work at epa their zeal their commitment the fact that for them its not just a job they really believe in what theyre doing and that they are doing something fundamentally important that is what made our four years a very productive and exciting time its a time that epa professionals and the country beyond washington will look back on as a time of enormous creativity and energy and achievement in the environment so i was happy to have been along for that ride q thank you for your time epa k september  interview conducted by dr dennis williams bill reilly  wikipedia bill reilly from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
