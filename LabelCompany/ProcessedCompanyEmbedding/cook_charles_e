reduced hardys suspension after a scientific expert testified that the advocare product was tainted advocare disputed the panels findings saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of clenbuterol in the supplements in  a dallas county jury awarded  million in damages against advocare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors according to the lawsuit litigants bruce and teresa badgett of arlington texas had been active and profitable marketers of advocare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in  based upon vague and trumpedup charges the jury found that advocare engaged in false misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with advocare were unconscionable according to court documents advocare disputed the ruling and on april   filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the texas deceptive trade practices act the appeal was dismissed on march   and the company was ordered to reimburse the badgetts for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case advocare ceased offering kickstart spark targeted to youth age  after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing  mg of caffeine advocare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events in  the company paid  to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in sacramento but after negative publicity advocare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events wendy miller of the beaumont weight control center said advocares herbal cleanse is probably safe for many users but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products in march  advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in espn the magazine the exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signingup of new distributors rather than sales of the product while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money that the company creates a cultlike atmosphere of not questioning the companys claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the companys strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model with more devout members of the organization
