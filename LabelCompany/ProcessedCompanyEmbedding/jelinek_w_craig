usually bulkpackaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on

boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most

richard a galanti sales modeledit costco warehouse interior in mountain view california costco focuses on selling products at low prices often at very high volume these goods are usually bulkpackaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor this contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves most products have an  to  markup while the kirkland signature brand products have a  markup the company runs very lean with overhead costs at about  of revenue

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most

richard a galanti sales modeledit costco warehouse interior in mountain view california costco focuses on selling products at low prices often at very high volume these goods are usually bulkpackaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor this contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves most products have an  to  markup while the kirkland signature brand products have a  markup the company runs very lean with overhead costs at about  of revenue

lanes published october  costcos ceo w craig jelinek photo ryan lowry to call costco a store is an understatement while stocking up on paper products and pantry staples the retailer’s  million cardholders can also get an eye exam book a cruise and even buy life insurance its fans are fiercely loyal and its critics members and nonmembers alike have strong opinions about everything from its annual membership fee to its food court’s switch from coke to pepsi when we announced that costco’s ceo w craig jelinek would field reader questions the emails and facebook messages poured in here a selection of his answers q has costco considered letting nonmembers shop there—perhaps once every few months—yuval fleming kent wa a it’s not a workable possibility first we believe it would compromise the under­lying premise of the membership concept second the basic  annual fee covers a variety of membership administrative and operating costs thereby allowing costco to sell merchandise at everlower prices costco’s average merchandise markups are in the  percent range compared with other retailformat markups ranging from  percent to more than  percent the annual cost of membership is dwarfed by the annual savings q i enjoy products from costco’s kirkland signature store brand but i feel some get dropped prematurely before they’re given a chance to click with consumers what’s the criteria for whether a kirkland product sticks around—thomas gruber seattle a the basic criteria for a new kirkland signature item it must be as good or better in quality than the comparable branded item and it can be offered to our members at a price at least  percent lower than we would sell the branded item we try to ensure all of our members are able to try the new item through our demosampling program after nine months to a year we measure its weekly sales generated per building if it doesn’t meet targets we delete the item—as we would any item we sell q costco sells everything in huge sizes—except clothes thirty percent of americans are seriously overweight yet for all the pound cans of cheese sauce and count packages of icecream bars there is almost no plussize clothing in the stores what gives—jenny reiswig san diego a over the past year we have tested apparel items in plus sizes in about  percent of our us warehouses moving forward we have decided to focus on expanding plussize assortments on costcocom current women’s items include kirkland signature active wear gloria vanderbilt pants and shorts as well as various styles of dresses tanks and tops for men the focus is also on carrying a yearround assortment of big and tall items on costcocom including kirkland signature dress shirts wool dress pants casual cotton pants and jeans and softshell jackets q as a corporation making billions of dollars in profit each year you are benefiting from shrimping exploitation in thailand those fishermen are forced to work without pay on fishing boats sometimes for years on end they work hour shifts and endure beatings will you institute a zerotolerance policy on slavery—carole shelton auburn ca a we are very aware of recent media reports concerning labor abuses in the thai fishing industry the agreements that costco has with its suppliers prohibit among other things use of slave labor we are committed to working with our suppliers of thai shrimp to require them to take corrective action with respect to poor labor practices this commitment so far has involved visits by our buying staff to thailand and discussions with the thai government our suppliers and other industry participants we are continuing those discussions q why in the name of all that is holy don’t you have an express lane in your warehouses often i buy two items only to be stuck behind people with two overfull carts—s culos toronto a costco’s ability to sell merchandise at incredibly low prices is based on adhering to various operating disciplines at every turn instead of having an express line—that often would be open but without a member in line—we have invested millions of dollars to speed up the entire frontend process our policy is “no more than one member in line and two members waiting behind” the average completed frontend transaction is just over  minute we want your ceo choices tell us which chief executive—or company—you want to hear from at

toxic rounduprussell weiler ashland orrussell weilerashland orsupportersglyphosate the main ingredient in monsanto’s roundup is the most used herbicide on earth from mass agriculture to backyard gardening it is sprayed on most of the produce we cultivate so much so in fact that a sampling of waterways in  states found glyphosate in the majority of rivers and streams tested it was also found in about  percent of rainfall samples perhaps most disturbingly some studies have even found elevated levels of glyphosate in american women’s breast milk for years the environmental protection agency deemed glyphosate nonharmful to humans but now an agency of the world health organization has declared that it “probably” causes cancer in people and a new study found that roundup’s other ingredients amplify the toxic effect on human cells—even at concentrations much more diluted than those used on farms and lawns in the wake of these studies whole countries like sri lanka brazil mexico and the netherlands are restricting or fully outlawing roundup use the us has yet to do anything about it but there is one american company that has declared its commitment to conscious consumer practices and it should lead the charge in removing roundup from its shelves costco has stopped selling eggs from caged chickens and worked hard to become the country’s largest retailer of organic foods let’s call on costco to keep up the good work and remove dangerous roundup from its retail inventory costco’s ceo jim sinegal is known as a renegade among retail executives because of his diehard commitment to good corporate citizenship from higher than average hourly wages and outstanding health benefits for workers to careful selection of the products the store chooses to carry costco has risen above the crowd and shown the us that its fifth largest retailer can be successful and socially responsible all at once jim sinegal has another great chance to demonstrate his values by treating roundup as the

months at the helm the costco ceo discusses the company’s history and its current success austin smith tmfbwitime aug   at pm the fool chats with costco nasdaqcost ceo craig jelinek craig first joined the company as a warehouse manager in  quickly rising to become a regional manager and then advancing through various executive posts over the years he became president and coo in  and took over from longtime ceo jim sinegal in january  craig shares his experiences with costco the philosophy behind the retail giants success in the us and its experiences in markets from canada to taiwan austin smith hey fools austin smith here and im joined by craig jelinek the new ceo of costco first of all thank you so much for taking the time to sit down with us today craig jelinek glad to do it austin im not sure if youre aware of this but i believe costco was the firstever recommendation in our flagship newsletter by our ceo so we have a deep love for the company weve loved costco for years so we really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us and our members today jelinek well we appreciate that and i hope you shop with us also austin i am a proud costco member and please keep the price of the hotdog and soda at  i know it hasnt changed and i hope that now that youre at the helm you dont want to shake it up and make it  jelinek trust me thats never going to change if i have to subsidize it personally its not going to change austin i like that im wondering obviously a big transition now that youre at the helm im wondering whats changed for you as youre leading this great company forward jelinek well i dont know that a lot has obviously a lots changed because the buck stops with me but as you know weve got jim was a founder weve got a very strong culture most of us have worked with the company in key executive positions for  years im very fortunate obviously those are big shoes to fill but weve got a great management team and things have moved on accordingly before jim stepped down i was president for two years and we talked about what the future looked like and thought through a game plan so i think were well equipped for the next  years austin obviously you and jim worked very closely over the years jelinek we have austin youve probably learned a lot from each other what other really great retail executives  or executives in general  have you guys found inspiration from that you admire in the industry jelinek well i think when you talk about sol price who was the originator or founder of price company and fedmart one thing that we both learned from him is continue to always do whats right for your employees and always try to do whats right for the consumer if you keep the consumer and your employees and do the right thing things have a way of working out for you you build trust with your employees you build trust with your consumer  which is really just common sense and good business  but i think thats probably what we learned the most just always do the right thing this isnt rocket science you just want to continue to bring the value to the consumer you want to pay good wages you get good people treat people fairly and if you can keep your expenses down you keep your prices down youre going to sell a lot of merchandise and thats what we do buy and sell goods austin pretty simple formula it sounds like jelinek its simple the hard part is keeping it simple austin you guys are one of the rare companies that left all your stakeholders very happy  your customers your employees your shareholders as you think about all the people who are affected from costcos daytoday operations where do you start is it with the customer is it with your employees who do you start with jelinek well its a combination of both obviously before you ever open up your doors you have to start with your employees and you have to have suppliers but the bottom line is if you look at our mission statement you take care of your customer your member you take care of your employees you take care of your suppliers actually the first thing is always obey the law then if you do all those things youre going to reward the shareholders thats always been our philosophy if you get too shortsighted and you want to reward your shareholders as the most important thing chances are youre not going to be in business in five or   years our view is we want to have a company for the long haul and continue to grow the sales and grow the profits fairly and make sure theres always opportunity for our employees to grow if you look at the last  years our stock has grown about  a year in value and we think weve got a pretty fair return for our shareholders austin pretty good clip you cant be upset with that sort of return jelinek no we think its been more than fair and we think weve got a business model thats going to last us for a long time austin one of the in my opinion most impressive statistics that i see about your company is the amazing renewal rates  upward of  i believe most recently jelinek right were  high so were close if you round it were at  in the us and in canada and were in the mids in our international part of the business which is asia which actually is considered to have improved considerably austin interesting how do you guys achieve that amazing retention its absolutely phenomenal customer retention how do you guys cultivate that number year after year after year jelinek well the consumer pays for a membership and they make that decision based on what they figure the value of the membership is i think if you continue to bring value to the consumer and bring quality to the consumer and know the consumer knows if the item doesnt perform well they can bring it back you build trust with the consumer and i think its really that simple they like what they see and they continue to renew if they wont like us they dont like what they see theyre not going to renew so i think if you look at it they like it so theyre renewing austin right jelinek its kind of simple i dont know how else to put it austin when i think about your company i think of things like high renewal rate great customer service low prices  but then i also think about amazon the very same way im a happy costco member and an amazon prime member you guys both have phenomenally low prices youre both notoriously very customerfocused keep wall street at arms length and focus on the products and service first how do you guys see amazon are they a threat are they a complementary retailer how do you think about them in the landscape today because they seem to be the retailer that has the most closely espoused your virtues of low prices and customers first jelinek well if you look at anybody that sells anything theyre a threat anybody in business that sells merchandise is a threat what we have to continue to do we think we offer two avenues we have our core brickandmortars where you can come in and shop particularly and buy a lot of fresh foods a lot of wine health and beauty aids things like that then weve got the nonfood assortment in fact if you want to buy online you have the ability to also shop with us online in terms of buying tvs and general merchandise we still think day in and day out we bring the best value in the marketplace and youve got two options you also have an easy option if you want to bring the merchandise back you can bring what you bought online and you can bring it into the warehouses to return we think we can compete well with amazon theres always going to be in my view two forms of retail brickandmortars and online but i think its always going to be very difficult  although people test it  i think buying and distributing food and sundries and fresh foods in the marketplace overall is going to be difficult to do and very expensive austin looking at your positioning then the retail landscape is obviously changing dramatically a lot of things being done online do you view a brickandmortar competitor like walmart or an onlinebased competitor like amazon as maybe a bigger concern or a bigger threat to costcos model jelinek i think like i said before theyre both threats as is target a threat as is whole foods a threat the key is being the lowcost provider thats going to be the key for anybody winning the battle long term its whoever can bring value and bring the best quality of merchandise to the marketplace at the best price i think thats really the key austin what do you think is the most misunderstood thing about costco today that you just keep hearing and youre like oh thats not the case is there a common misunderstanding about your business that you see jelinek i dont think theres really a misunderstanding were always you used the word theyre a discounter well when you say that we are a discounter we bring quality merchandise to the marketplace at a very good price we have department storetype items that we bring to the marketplace its not like its inexpensive or cheap merchandise i think over time that has taken care of itself the people know that we have quality merchandise at a very good price theyre not seconds theyre not closeouts its quality merchandise that you can buy at most department stores or highend stores at a very good price if you look at our jewelry if you look at our watches if you look at our sporting goods if you look at our television sets its all quality namebrand merchandise if you look at our privatelabel merchandise our kirkland signature thats equal to or better than national brands at a better price austin you guys obviously participate in a huge spread of the retail space  electronics and jewelry and food as you mentioned what are the biggest defining trends in retail that you guys are seeing going on today is it privatelabel consumption is it organic consumption that investors may want to get ahead of if they see these changes happening jelinek well theres two things organic in my view is here to stay but also organic is also very expensive our view is to figure out always how to bring organics at a better value or a better price to the marketplace kirkland signature were looking at kirkland signature organics were looking at being able to do that i think both i think the private label or controlled label as long as its quality is going to become a bigger part of the business because i think more and more brands not so much in the nonfood that theyll be big because brands are still very important because theres so much advertisement out there on brands austin on the foods end jelinek no nonfoods but on the food part of the business i think more and more if theres trust in the house that sells it therell be trust in the brand i think thats one of the things that weve got going for us that weve got trust in there in the kirkland signature name if you look at that name its just not in a few items that kirkland signature is from diapers to luggage to meat to vitamins its a pretty brand name that covers a lot of merchandise so you have to be careful to make sure that you protect the integrity of every item that you sell so you dont lose the reputation on that kirkland signature brand austin makes a lot of sense jelinek but weve been able to protect it and i think theres a lot of confidence in the kirkland signature when we first went to it about  years ago it was very slow but now anything that we put kirkland signature brand on people are not concerned about trying it austin do you see any other big paradigm shifts in retail that we didnt talk about just as you observe the landscape jelinek you know like i said i think youre going to probably see a lot more organics i think people particularly depending on what economic level they are are going to buy healthier cleaner ingredients i think organic produce is very big for us the problem is if we just dealt in organic produce we would never have enough produce to get by in a given week let alone a year its all about availability i think over time youll see probably more production being shifted to organics but thats going to take time austin how do you personally evaluate the success of costco jelinek i think theres a couple things you can evaluate success is a lot of different things to a lot of different people i think if you look at it that if you can continue to provide value to the consumer your business is going to continue to grow if your business continues to grow youre going to provide opportunity for your employees if you can provide opportunity for your employees your employees are also going to be able to grow theyre going to be able to support their families and enjoy a better quality of life if those things happen you will just continue to reward the shareholders our whole view is i want to be able to go in the food court  years from now when im old with my walker and sit down and say i remember you when to some of our employees  thats very important to be able to create a company long term thats going to continue to grow and provide opportunities yet youll do that by taking care of the member and creating them great value austin in the evaluation of costco from your perspective are there any metrics that you look at that investors may not necessarily be aware of samestore sales is one of the obvious metrics to look at in retail but what do you look at internally in evaluating costcos success jelinek well certainly you look at your comp business you also look at your renewal rate thats very important we also try to look at the growth that we see were always measuring we think the model will work as it has worked in a lot of other countries no matter what country you live in you want to be able to buy merchandise at the best possible price so we certainly are looking at that our employee turnover  which is less than  at the management level and less than  in the overall hourly level  i think is a very important piece for us which talks about employee satisfaction those are some of the things that we always look at austin ok i wonder if you could explain the dynamics in terms of purchasing power that allows you guys to continually offer the lowest prices for consumers because technically on paper it would look like walmart or amazon might be able to outpurchase you but you guys are able to consistently provide a more affordable product in many instances im wondering if you could explain that disconnect jelinek well keep in mind its not always how you purchase goods youve got to purchase goods and you purchase at the best possible price right now when you look at our sales per item theyre much greater than amazon or probably walmart because we only have less than  items where if you look at our competitors they have substantially more items  maybe eight or  times more than the  where the math doesnt work in terms of sales with that being said we think we can bring efficiencies to a supplier which allows us to sometimes buy a certain item at a better price but also our sga which is what it costs us  our administrative costs  is less than  theres probably nobody close to us in terms of sga in the retail environment that has a better sga than we do if you look at walmart theyre probably about  and i think amazon is probably at a  although they both have other means of margin revenue coming in but its just as important to be efficient to lower your expenses because then you can work off of less margin in terms of selling merchandise austin makes sense are there any retailers  in the broader space at all  that you really admire that you see and you say wow they really got it right or i admire their operations jelinek i think amazons done a good job in terms of building a brand with their customer service i think theyve done a very good job of that i think whole foods has got their niche in terms of quality merchandise and i think trader joes is a company that pays very good wages theyve got limited selection and theyve got great quality merchandise and theyve got a great reputation out there with the suppliers so i think theyve done a very good job even a company called aldi which is starting to come to the us  theyre a private company  but theyre a very simple operation that cuts a lot of overhead out and theyve been very good at bringing merchandise to the market at a very low price austin youve got to appreciate that then jelinek absolutely thats the name of the game austin whats your favorite item on costcos shelves today jelinek you know i love our hot dog theres no place else you can get a better item for  austin thats true jelinek i like our toilet paper because obviously thats the no  selling item that we have and i love our kirkland signature shirts thats the only thing that i basically wear like this austin i assume this is one today jelinek this is it i think thats become a great item for us its become a big volume item for us when i really notice when i get excited is when i go to pick up my dry cleaning and i see all the shirts in there that look like mine i know that that shirt is being purchased out there in the marketplace austin im a big fan of the kirkland label but i have to say ive got trouble with the slim fit i havent been able to make it work if you guys have anything in the pipeline let me know because id buy my shirts there all day jelinek we have slim fits austin youre a slim what about extra slim european slim jelinek youre a rarity austin yes no plans for that jelinek no plans for that at the moment i dont know how many people would fall into that category austin theres not many of us were not big purchasers you would not do well to target that niche what about when christmas time rolls around what are you putting in the family stockings from costco jelinek well you know when i grew up you put toothbrushes and socks and stuff like that in the christmas sock but tvs are becoming very big for us we sell a lot of bose speakers the tablets samsung tablets are becoming very big we sell a lot of apparel during the christmas season we sell a lot of jewelry we sell a lot of watches during the holiday season so that will continue to be big for us our domestics business i would say vacuum cleaners but thats probably not a good thing as a christmas present or mothers day present austin no that gets you in the doghouse pretty quickly jelinek this day and age but our jewelry business continues to grow our apparel business items like that then again were very big during the holiday season particularly with our prime rib and our fish items our shrimp items like that we do a big job  hams  during the christmas season austin you mentioned your electronics section and the strong samsung presence you have when i look across the consumer electronics landscape today its hard to ignore the apple presence that apple has but apple seems notably absent from costco how is that dynamic shaking out are you guys trying to target apple have you thought about bringing them in jelinek i think its  we always continue occasionally to have dialogue and to see if somehow we can show a value for the apple products so far we havent been able to work out something time will tell if that happens but we seem to be doing well without each other apples doing well without being in costco and costco seems to thrive with not having apple its going to work out for each one one way or the other if it doesnt work where we can work with each other it doesnt work thats ok life goes on austin looking at some of your operating metrics its hard to miss the extreme efficiency you guys seem to be getting out of canada compared to your us business i think the average sales per canadian citizen compared to a us citizen are about two times approximately what are you guys doing up in canada thats working so well jelinek well theres a couple things if you compared canada to the west coast you would probably see that theyre pretty similar because were so well entrenched in the west coast were not really going into any new markets in canada everythings basically tied around the vancouver the winnipeg smaller markets if you look at the midwest and the southeast some of those buildings are doing less sales volume which brings it down because were relatively new in those marketplaces if you look at canada the expansion has been less weve been entrenched a lot longer in just that canadian market in terms of the big markets in there where we just open up buildings close by you open up another building anywhere from here to san diego and they start out very strong from day one when you go into places like fargo and rochester minnesota and east peoria illinois those buildings it just takes time to build because you dont have any membership base we dont open up a building in canada where we dont already have a huge membership base nearby austin interesting do you expect over time those numbers to maybe converge a little bit jelinek absolutely no question no question austin what sort of different dynamics have you seen operating internationally we know that many retailers when they try and go abroad it can be the kiss of death because they try and apply the same strategies with difficultly have you guys run into that jelinek well what you have to do is  when we went international  what you have to do is just be who you are what got you there we know the model that works now you may sell a little bit different product line but the packages are big one of the things that weve done is brought ustype goods over there you didnt see many people eat bagels in japan when we went in there we took the same bagel recipe that we have here and created it in japan and its one of our biggest items over there what makes us successful in these countries i think is because were different than everybody else just like when we start in the us were just different than everybody else in canada were just different than everybody else mexico were different its a unique type of business that theres not a lot of people that look the same and do business the same whenever youre different and you can bring value the consumer tends to like it austin great just a followon to that you look at a walmart going international its because theyre running out of us space you look at a map of your company  seattle we might have  locations boston we might have two or three over on the east coast  basically what kind of upside do you think you still have in america could you see costco doubling its presence from this point jelinek over a period of time i think thats very possible to do i would think that we could  you never know whats going to happen in the marketplace you never know whats going to happen in the economy you never know what kind of situations could happen in different countries but we feel very comfortable over the next  years we could double the size of the company we think theres a lot of opportunities still left in the us austin thats just doubling domestically jelinek no i would say domestically  we could probably come close in  years austin a lot of the bigger retailers out there  companies like target and walmart  are chasing customers into their  the urbanization that weve seen target city has been popping up seems to be pretty successful walmarts had some smaller locations as well that have exceeded their expectations for success as a bigfootprint retailer are you guys looking at a similar strategy would you consider moving to smaller formats to catch that urbanization trend jelinek if you look at where were not exactly in downtown seattle were awful close were probably three miles from downtown which works just fine for us people will come to us and shop we want to continue to keep what we do simple if you start to drift and become complicated it costs you a lot of money to be complicated then what starts to happen it costs you more goods your cost of labor  when i say cost of labor your sga starts to go up  and then all of a sudden where you were under  now you start getting up to   which means you have to start raising your prices to get you there at the moment i dont see us going there we dont like to be on multi levels even in foreign countries we have a few where we have twostory shopping but we dont want that were doing everything to get to onestory shopping no escalators for having to move customers up and down because frankly the escalators break down theyre very expensive to maintain what we want to do is if property is hard to come by well go onefloor sales and maybe have two or three floors of parking but we want to try to keep everything very simple austin ive often wondered the dynamic of these multilevel stores city target we went in the other day is just checking it out its three levels what does the dynamic look like as far as customer behavior do people just not make it up to those second and third levels or is it merely just transporting carts that is a big difficulty jelinek i think they make it up there but not as often i think  transporting the carts is an issue but in our business particularly were very strong also in the food and sundries part of the business so you have to go up there with a shopping basket because youre carrying meats and items like that i think in our business its just more difficult to do wed just as soon stay away from it we have found where we do have multi levels its considerably more expensive over a years time to run that business austin especially with the huge pallets i can imagine those just dont translate very well jelinek not only  they dont go by escalator but you have to take those huge pallets down by storage elevators theres a big expense to putting pallets in a storage elevator and going up and down austin makes a lot of sense jelinek weve chosen to stay away from that as much as we can austin seems like a good choice analyst everyone has to be intrigued by china just because its such an opportunity you guys havent explored that yet i think pricesmart had actually licensed to china and pulled out within a year whats your feel on the space have you guys looked at it and decided its not an opportunity right now or is it youre focusing enough on other opportunities like south korea and japan its just not on your horizon yet jelinek well weve got us a pretty good business going in asia where were at right now theres lots of opportunities in the countries in japan in korea in taiwan were looking at france and spain well get that going you have to be careful weve always been very conservative not to stretch the management so far where we cant run the business the way we choose to run it i dont see us  china will always be there china will be there  years from now  years from now at some point well probably look at the opportunities in china weve been over there weve looked at it but right now we think weve got enough in asia going on right now with taiwan korea and japan and within the us where we can do just fine if were not in china austin there are a lot of retailers that have gone to china certainly with international experience and theyve done very poorly over there i know best buy has done very poorly walmarts had a tough time why do you think it is that big ordinarily successful retailers have a really tough time with china jelinek you know i think thats a pretty good question thats one reason that its not fair for me to say because i havent spent a lot of time over there i think when i go in there they all kind of look the same so maybe you cant tell whats different about them just because theyre from the us but thats one of the reasons that were very successful in korea japan taiwan so we might as well go there if we knew somebody that was really successful over in china but we havent seen that at the moment more people seem to be cutting back than going in there which to me thats kind of a red flag austin you talked about in the us if you go somewhere  lets say omaha  the store is not going to make as much as one on the west coast because you have to establish yourself there theres always a cost china will always be there but theres a cost to maybe being later and trying to build your presence there how do you think about that tradeoff between executing and being able to take advantage of opportunities and be among the first to establish in a market before other companies go and open up warehouse concepts and build up their customer base jelinek the key is that theres got to be other companies that go in there and build there not many people have gone in and been successful in the warehouse business at one time there was probably eight different clubs now youre basically down to three youve got bjs youve got sams and youve got costco i dont know that youre going to see anybody else jump in the business at the moment when we feel that the time is ready then we would go over there and compete but right at the moment we dont see that being something that we have to do austin when you went to japan and korea before europe was that because you had seen more success within the warehouse space or demographics what made you go over there before jelinek we just saw that japan when we went actually over to japan and taiwan we saw a pretty good economy over there keep in mind both of those markets started out very slow for us korea was very tough for us but over time you just whittle away and good things start to happen as long as you continue to bring value in the marketplace and your consumer figures it out we dont do a lot of advertising you have to sell memberships and they have to feel comfortable it is a little intimidating when you walk in there to a costco and you see the big sizes and you start to ask yourself how is this going to work for me they used to say you cant sell swing sets over in japan because they dont have big homes thats one of our biggest selling items was a swing set people figure these things out in terms of going in there it takes time but you build your membership and once you start to get a reputation and a marketplace and your reputation comes from doing the right thing and word of mouth for the consumer good things will start to happen all those asian countries were now very
