is the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish crustaceans mollusks and aquatic plants aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions and can be contrasted with commercial fishing which is the harvesting of wild fish consumption from aquaculture farming has overtaken consumption of wildcaught fish and this trend is set to continue for decades to come according to government statistics in fact is is predicted that the majority of fish consumption in  years will be from farmed fish how we raise our fish agrieuro corp plans to build several fish farms across the ponds that we are currently constructing our crystal clear blue waters and consistently fresh water currents emanating from the danube river provide our fish with a natural stressfree environment in which to mature until they reach the commercial size with vertical integration of our production we control and secure all the stages of production giving us full autonomy on the endresult the fish will be grown with the highest world standards and will satisfy demand from even the most peculiar buyers here are some of the aspects that will make our fisheries stand out we will not use genetically modified raw materials we will constantly control the breeding process extra care for the juvenile fish feed end products continuous monitoring of the environment in which the fish live a complete traceability system fish and mediterranean diet the mediterranean diet reflects as the name implies the typical dietary habits of the people of the mediterranean countries in the pyramid of the mediterranean diet the groups of food are “ranked” from the base to its top according to how often they should be included in our diet it is recommended according to the pyramid that we consume fish  or  times a week because they contain vitamin b complex and iron scientific research has confirmed that fish is a unique source of the ω polyunsaturated fatty acids according to the health claim which was approved under the eu regulation  the consumption of farmed sea bream and sea bass as a rich source of ω polyunsaturated fatty acids epa  dha and as part of a healthy lifestyle
