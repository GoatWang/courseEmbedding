studies the final steps before filing an ind and entering clinical studies in man cgmp manufacturing is ready to begin within  days with glp tox studies commencing as soon as cgmp product is availablethis novel rapalog has demonstrated through extensive preclinical testing a profile that is expected to deliver a superior combination of efficacy and safety vs rapamycin and to provide an important new therapeutic option for patients suffering with sle with its multimodal mechanism of action rapamycin has proven effective at treating refractory sle in one openlabel study david fernandez et al arthritis  rheumatism     but with a side effect profile that includes dyslipemia dysregulation of glucose metabolism and decreased reticulocyte countswe believe that rapamycin is not an optimal candidate for chronic therapy in sle particularly given the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen in these patients tam has shown  efficacy vs rapamycin in standard sle models without the adverse event profile that limits rapamycins utility in these patientsread morethe sle market represents an area of high unmet need and rapid sales growth with a recent decision

decade along with our understanding of how diseasemodifying therapeutics might benefit patients across a broad range of disease states including cancer cognitive disorders muscular dystrophies and a variety of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases at mount tam we intend to use our unique approach to drug discovery to bring forward medications that can have a lasting positive impact on patients livesfinancial update mount tam is pleased to have executed a secured promissory note in march  whereby mount tam may borrow up to one million dollars  with the agreement of the holder of the
