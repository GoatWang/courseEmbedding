home  palouse capital management view our strategies contact us view our strategies contact us our process in today’s information driven markets equity prices normally reflect reasonable valuations based on the long term fundamentals of issuing companies there are however often situations in which a security can be temporarily mispriced relative to the issuing company’s prospects for the future understanding a company’s long term fundamentals and prospects – and their influence on a security’s value today – is the key to successful fundamental value investing at palouse capital our seasoned team of investment professionals applies a fundamental value approach to every decision we make on behalf of our clients we strive to understand the long term prospects of each company we analyze if we believe that the current price of a security is materially lower than a reasonable fundamentally driven estimate of long term value we consider the security for purchase when we believe a current portfolio holding has reached our current estimate of value we consider the security for sale learn more about our process strategies smallmid value strategypcm’s smallmid value “smv” strategy seeks

long term fundamentals of issuing companies there are however often situations in which a security can be temporarily mispriced relative to the issuing company’s prospects for the future understanding

investment professionals applies a fundamental value approach to every decision we make on behalf of our clients we strive to understand the long term prospects of each company we analyze if we believe that the current price of a security is materially lower than a reasonable fundamentally driven estimate of long term value we consider the security for purchase when we believe a current
