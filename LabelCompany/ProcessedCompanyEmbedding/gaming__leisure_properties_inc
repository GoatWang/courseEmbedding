playback can be accessed through august   disclosure regarding nongaap financial measures funds from operations ffo adjusted funds from operations affo and adjusted ebitda which are detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release are used by the company as performance measures for benchmarking against the companys peers and as internal measures of business operating performance which is used for a bonus metric the company believes ffo affo and adjusted ebitda provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the companys current business  this is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and we believe that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straightline basis over time in addition in order for the company to qualify as a reit it must distribute  of its reit taxable income annually  the company adjusts affo accordingly to provide our investors an estimate of taxable income for this distribution requirement direct financing lease adjustments represent the portion of cash rent we receive from tenants that is applied against our lease receivable and thus not recorded as revenue and the amortization of land rights represents the noncash amortization of the value assigned to the companys assumed ground leases ffo affo and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures that are considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation  we have defined affo as ffo excluding stock based compensation expense debt issuance costs amortization other depreciation amortization of land rights straightline rent adjustments and direct financing lease adjustments reduced by capital maintenance expenditures finally we have defined adjusted ebitda as net income excluding interest taxes on income depreciation gains or losses from sales of property stock based compensation expense straightline rent adjustments direct financing lease adjustments and the amortization of land rights ffo affo and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under gaap  because certain companies do not calculate ffo affo and adjusted ebitda in the same way and certain other companies may not perform such calculation those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the company calculates such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating profit or net income the companys presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of the companys financial results in accordance with gaap about gaming and leisure properties glpi is engaged in the business of acquiring financing and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triplenet lease arrangements pursuant to which the tenant is responsible for all facility maintenance insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business
