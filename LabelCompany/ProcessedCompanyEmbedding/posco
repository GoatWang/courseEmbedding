posco center  pohang and gwangyang steelworks  subsidiaries  major competitors  see also  references  external links historyedit –edit in the s south korean president park chunghees administration concluded that selfsufficiency in steel and the construction of an integrated steelworks were essential to economic developmentcitation needed since south korea had not possessed a modern steel plant prior to  many foreign and domestic businesses were skeptical of seouls decision to invest so heavily in developing its own industrycitation needed despite the skepticism under the lead of park taejoon dec  then taegutec president posco was established as a joint venture between the korean government and taegutec it began production in  just four years after the companys inauguration in april  with thirtynine employees japan provided the money for the construction of the initial plant following an agreement made at the third south koreajapan ministerial meeting in  financing included usmillion in government grants and loans us million in credit from the exportimport bank of japan and technical assistance from nippon steel and other corporations this cooperation was one consequence of the normalization of relations with japan in  and reflected the view of the government of japan as noted in the nixonsato communique of november   that the national security of the republic of korea is essential to the security of japan –edit posco first began to sell plate products in  and focused its sales policies on the domestic market to improve steel selfsufficiency at home it made special efforts to supply quality iron and steel to related domestic companies at below export price to strengthen their international competitiveness posco produced  million tons of raw steel in  recording a  increase over the previous yearcitation needed and was one of the few exceptions when almost all areas of the korean economy were in economic depression domestic industries absorbed poscos major products such as automobile and home appliance manufacturers consuming hot rolled products shipbuilding and construction and engineering companies consuming medium plates and electric motor and transformer manufacturers consuming electrical sheets some overproduced products were exported to foreign countries but the significant import of sections for construction left korea as a net importer globally posco was already the most efficient steel producer in certain productscitation needed by the late s poscos growth had been immense it was the fifth biggest steel company in the world with an annual production approaching  million tons worth  trillion woncitation needed poscos continued to expand productivity and size at a time when the steel industries of the united states and japan were declining posco completed its secondphase mill at gwangyang in august  a thirdphase mill completed in  further increased crude steel production to a total output of approximately  million tons a yearcitation needed in terms of productivity posco was the worlds best steel manufacturer throughout the late s and also was at the top in terms of facilitiescitation needed pohang previously a fishing port whose major industry was processing fish and marine products became a major industrial center with almost  peoplecitation needed in addition to the huge integrated steel mill pohang became an industrial complex housing companies that manufacture finished steel products of raw materials provided pohang university of science and technology postechedit posco ceo park taejoon was quoted as saying you can import coal and machines but you cannot import talent park realized the need for korea to educate their youth in science and technology to ensure koreas position in the high technology arena park founded the pohang university of science and technology postech in  as korea’s first science and technology researchoriented university with the mission to educate young koreans who can contribute to national prosperity through the advancement in science and technology postech has since become one of the best universities in korea consistently topping domestic and international university rankings in  and  the times higher education ranked postech st in their  under  young universities rankings –edit changes in managerial systems and organizational structure accelerated in  when poscos president and founder park taejoon who had wielded absolute managerial authority for more than  years resigned with the change in leadership—from park taejoon to ryusang bu posco increased decentralization and diversification poscos management emphasized greater flexibility autonomy and consensual decisionmaking processes the chairman also moved to devolve more autonomy to the profit centres and changing from a strictly hierarchical organizational structure to one based on teams in july  posco created two subsidiary companies posteel and postrade posteel is the domestic sales and service arm of the company while postrade handles international trading of posco products both subsidiaries commenced full operation in september  with all international posco
