revelation or by topic a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t uv w xyz latest news  ministry manifesto the latest featured resource defining inerrancy printed from httptektonicsorghelmsrphp randel helms who wrote the gospels a critique the following may be said in summary of randel helms who wrote the gospels millennium press  it contains no new arguments contains the same errors of thought method and background data that we found in helms previous book reviewed briefly here consists mainly of compilations of and unquestioning acceptance of arguments rom liberaljesus seminar biblical scholarship with no consideration of opposing views the only evangelical in the bibliography is robert gundry and he is referred to only once on a point helms happens to agree with tthe bibliography itself consists of about  sources hardly sufficient for such a broad and important topic that has been the subject of discussions and scholarship for decades thus it is that this evaluation will consist largely of references to other places where we or someone else has already answered the arguments at issue little else is needed in the introduction to this work helms lays out his key premise that the gosepls are deliberately even playfully anonymous and naturally argues that all four of the traditional attributions are wrong and the product of wishful thinking he finds this relatively easy to prove we respond with material already provided here with special attention to the notice of hengel that the gospels must have received their attributions very early here also helms declares allegiance to the bultmaniann thesis of a sitz im leben as a determining factor for the content of the gospels here we refer the reader to bauckhams the gospels for all christians which we have reviewed here helms makes much of the alleged bias and therefore untrustworthiness of the gospel authors a concept refuted by glenn miller here and declares allegiance to the theses of q and markan priority said to be a thesis held by all but fundamentalists hiding their heads in the sand for our refutation of these ideas in process and proof that opposition to it is not merely the province of fundamentalists see here chapter  of helms book makes use of some of the same erroneous arguments used in helms first book gospel fictions helsm accuses the author of mark of error and confusion in attributing to isaiah a text conflated from isaiah the lxx of exodus and malachi actually a normal practice see glenn millers item on christian use of the ot makes much of the thematic arrangement of marks gospel as supposed evidence of lack of care over or guesswork involved in chronology though nonchronological arrangement is actually standard practice for ancient biography as we show here offers standard citations of alleged error in mark   and  helms appeals to arguments about the destruction of the temple which we have shown in an article linked above about gospel dates to be irrelevant he also appeals to the mistaken notion that mark expected the world to end soon see our series here helms claims that mark  the promise of false messiahs refers to two messianic pretenders named menahem and simon that josephus refers to but there is no evidence of anyone laying claim to the title other than jesus until possibly bar kochba in  ad simply because they were religious leaders or political rebels is not enough to say that they were messianic in mission mark  is declared to be in error about jewish customs based on the talmud which we have noted is far too late a source to be of relevance to the first century finally while we commend helms for recognizing marks use of the messianic secret motif while he makes much of the number of times jesus tells people to keep things secret he fails to note that mark records that those so admonished didnt keep the secret but went out and spread the word for more on this motif see here chapter  offers more material on mark but is mainly devoted to arguments about the inauthenticity of daniel all of which we have refuted here it also contains a rather loaded description of apocalyptic literature as the product of delusional and amoral minds amoral because they foresee judgment on others who disagree and questionbeggingly makes always wrong  a typical characteristic of such literature only three items are in any sense unique helms latedates daniel because of the reference to jeremiahs work as scripture dan  saying that the prophetic books were not canonized until about  bce so that no one would call jeremiah scripture until after that date in line with a  bc date for daniel hardly the word used in  is cepher and simply means books scrolls or any written document it does not connote a sacred or canonized book per se helms regards what happens in daniel  as a case of gabriel reinterpreting an incorrect prophecy in jeremiah there is no indication that gabriel is offering a new interpretation of jeremiah rather he is offering a new revelation that has nothing to do with jeremiah helms argues that daniel  is in error for as a prophecy of antiochus it says that he will plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him helms takes the between the seas reference as being to jerusalem but says since antiochus died in persia daniel has him dying in the wrong place but this does not say antiochus will die come to his end in this location between the seas it only says he will plant the tabernacles of his palace as helms version says pitch his royal pavilion in that place where antiochus meets his end is not specified at all what it does mean may not be clear to us the word for pavilion appears only here in the ot but it does not mean that this is the place antiochus died more likely it simply indicates where he will have headquarters some also claim v  was not fulfilled but it actually fits well with antiochus responding to the parthian threat from the east and north and killing jews as was his custom while on the way most also doubt that antiochus stalked egypt again as in v  but id rather take the word of porphyry who admitted that this did happen in trying to argue for daniel as a late invention than the silence used by the critics to claim that it didnt happen we may also add another observation from a friend of this ministry but the other hypothesis to which i referred is that the king of daniel  is herod the great notice that he is simply called the king the first time in the chapter in which the designation of the south or of the north is absent daniel  then turns back to the king of the north who is now caesar augustus since rome had already defeated and absorbed the seleucid empire and the king of the south who is actually a queen none other than cleopatra heir to the ptolemies and as yet unabsorbed by rome the details in these verses match augustus campaign against anthony culminating in actium and the sack of egypts treasuries almost perfectly somewhat awkwardly i admit  turns back again to herod the pronoun skipping back a few verses for its antecedent there are several advantages to this scenario and the only disadvantage is that the pronouns are unclear  being effectively a parenthesis first the king almost certainly has to be a jew since  has him honoring a god of fortresses which his fathers did not know the seer a devout jew surely would not care that a pagan king like antiochus abandoned his pagan religious heritage for another pagan religion also the desire of women i think is best understood as a periphrastic phrase for the messiah the one that every woman desired to birth and it makes more sense for a messianic offense to be charged against a jewish king than against a pagan king who could not care less about any messiah in the first place second there is hardly a better euphemism for the cult of the caesars which herod supported avidly throughout palestine than a god of fortresses third the notorious absence of infantry very unusual for ancient wars recall that even salamis needed a land battle to truly finish off the persian invasion in  fits actium and the taking of egypt to a tee fourth antiochus has already been described as doing as he pleases in  just like alexander in  it makes more sense if a third willful king is in view in  fifth herod an idumean jew liked to refer to our fathers in speeches to jews if  were written by a contemporary no scholar would doubt the allusion to that fact in those verses sixth herod is much nearer the end   than is antiochus and in fact his herodian dynasty does in fact last right up until the end  a d in other words he prospers until the indignation is finished  chapter  closes with a declaration that matthew and luke were unsuccessful efforts to outgrow marks failed eschatology we have shown previously by link that marks eschatology did not fail with that we move to chapter  which deals with matthew helms once again anachronizes by saying that we can imagine matthew sitting at his writing desk with a copy of mark open and a copy of the lxx open together no we cannot writing desks did not yet exist at this time what passed as a desk in those days was your own leg usually or the floor scribes had not yet conceived of using tables as a writing surface see more on these issues here there is the standard dismissal of papias testimony about matthew we have covered here then there is a chart setting out levels of remove from the historical jesus and presumably according to helms levels of reliability personal associates of jesus oral traditions about jesus written documents based on  mark matthew of course those in classes  are virtually the same who does helms think started and first received the oral traditions who does he think wrote it down first matthew was a scribe there is no proof in this list nor in anything helms argues that  are not anything but part of a tightlyknit community supplemented by the reliable nature of ancientjewish oral transmission processes a point we have faulted helms for not addressing previously returning to the qmarkan priority hypothesis helms advances as his most detailed proof the differences between the accounts of jesus baptism in mark matthew and luke  which we have addressed here helms only adds the idea that mark  and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased looks like a private revelation to jesus of information he did not have before which matthew having a birth narrative full of signs whereby jesus would be informed early of his own divinity covered by having the voice be general and heard by all such psychological exegesis is unnecessary helms must simply presume such ignorance by jesus based on an argument from silence and at any rate luke certainly had no problem using the direct address mode in spite of an early life full of signs another supposed proof is the difference between mark  and matthew  we are told that matthew corrects mark who has supposedly thought that parables were meant to obfuscate and has only erroneously quoted part of a passage of isaiah  that would seem to say so we are told that matthew corrected this deficiency by adding the full quote from isaiah which makes it clear that parables are for elucidation to say that mark would not know that parables were for elucidation is like saying that someone today would not know that spaceships are in scifi movies does helms think matthew was the only one who recognized this mistake in mark it is amazing how often these theses such as helms propounds requires convenient and alternating episodes of incredible error on the one hand and unique intelligence on the other marks allusion to isaiah  covers the whole of the passage anyone recognizing it would know just as helms supposes matthew would that the entire passage is being alluded to mark knows well enough that parables are for elucidation what helms has missed here is a literary device that allows mark to lead into the explanation for the parable for more on the authenticity of this explanation see here helms offers further psychological theorizing matthew changes marks carpenter to carpenters son because of his snobbery we are told how does this make it any more snobbish is garbageman any more or less snobbish than son of a garbageman in fact wouldnt the latter be more snobbish since one could read unemployment into it not that it matters the fatherson relationship in judaism was such that the association is exactly the same in terms of social status this is nothing more than we would expect from the normal variations within oral tradition this is not to say that such theorizing is always wrong one may suppose that matthew omitted the comment by jesus family suggesting christs insanity because he disliked the implications helms is also right to see mark using a motif of ignorance not as part of a messianic secret motif really but as part of his effort to imitate grecoroman dramatic styles and he is perhaps also right in supposing that matthew  which contains a greek play on words shows matthews editorial hand i say maybe  it is not altogether impossible that jesus spoke greek but even if he didnt this is hardly to be blasted away as fiction unless it can be shown that jesus did not offer words that were virtually the same message in aramaic editorial freedom does not equate with fictionalizing especially not in this literarysocial context what helms does is take the matter too far and see every shift of verbiage as part of some vast theological conspiracy of rivalry between the gospel authors or the characters to the point of reading emotions and intent into words and pretending to be able to read minds helms next two chapters are on luke and it is here where he offers his only really original thesis namely that the author of luke was a woman dismissing the standard arguments for lucan authorship with merely a wave of the hand and no critical analysis helms argues in essence that lukes portraits of women are so sympathetic and his portraits of men often so unflattering that only a woman could have written lukes gospel but this can be found in every gospel so perhaps what we see there is more a reflection of the unsubtle nature of men than anything else but what of that only a woman could write so highly of women why not also a male physician a person highly sympathetic to human suffering much of which was and still is inflicted upon women by men could not luke have been a male physician who attended childbirths addressed plagues saw the loving care that women bestowed upon others and came to empathize with them can helms not conceive of such a soul prior to the th century nor is there a complete escape from androcentric prejudices for as byrskog notes story as history  even in lukes gospel there is a tendency to pair women with men enhancing and legitimizing the female characters as it appears by reference to the existence and action of males perhaps most ironic is helms recourse to feminist biblical scholarship some of which reads luke as prowoman some as antiwoman helms remarks that this is a sign of real complexity of richly nuanced presentation in the works of this great writer on the contrary it is the sign of mirrorreading the political concerns of the modern century into a st century text and half of them erring as a result hard data as proof of this thesis is rather thin in favor helms quotes a feminist historian as noting that a slight change in one letter would turn theophilus into a female name thus making lukes patron a woman but they admit that no textual evidence exists for this idea in a negative sense helms tries to disassociate luke from paul by appealing to a number of the standard acts vs epistles arguments we have refuted here the only new one is an idea that  cor  it is good for a man not to touch a woman which helms reads as have nothing to do with a woman as misogny that the female luke would not stand for helms fails to comprehend the context of this remark which has to do with maintaining behavioral purity and is thus a polar opposite of misogyny other than that there is a standard overreading of lukes preface as indicating a large number of gospels in circulation aas we have noted here this is actually a literary device one that cannot be pressed too far there is an mistaken overreading of luke  in which helms asks why a samaritan would go to a jewish priest note that jesus never says specifically to the samaritan go to a jewish priest  does helms think that the samaritans didnt have religious authorities of their own to go to but then how would jesus know until later that any of the ten lepers was a samaritan finally there is more of helms gospel fictions thesis material which we have addressed conceptually in our previous article chapter  contains helms appeals to the gospel of thomas and that document as proof of the existence of q see here the secret gospel of mark see glenn millers essay here amd carlsons gospel hoax and a christianity of incredible diversity of which it is not for us to decide which was the true one see here there is little new here other than an allegation that the relative rarity of markan manuscripts suggests that the church was covertly trying to ignore or get rid of it helms tells us that while there is only one mss of mark as early as the third century there are  of matthew from the second and third century and  of luke now does this mean that the church also was inclined to get rid of luke but not so much as mark actually the sparsity of data here is such that no conclusion can be drawn but rather than envisioning a conspiracy to exterminate mark isnt is just as likely that matthews more extensive preservation is due to that gospels useful structure as a teaching tool while luke would be more useful to those of more intellectual interest and thus less preserved but still preserved more than mark because it has a great deal of unique material while mark being smaller and as helms is fond of pointing out containing little that is not in matthew and also being less sophisticated in its writing style was simply less used why do we need some collusion to explain this data when something far more prosaic will suffice the final three chapters are concerned with the gospel of john and here helms simply accepts the dictum of fortna and a few others that john is an edited compilation of three sources a signs gospel another editors work and a redactors work he also seems unknowing of advances in johnanine scholarship related to the dead sea scrolls although he does pin authorship for the original document on an alexandrian community of primitive jewish christians actual evidence cited for the divisions in john is fairly thin presumably fortna offers more details but helms only alludes to supposed evidence of literary seams and alleged contradictions as proof and offers specifically only two proofs first it is noted that our present john  has the decided look of something added after the fact actually this is generally accepted as true but that in and of itself does not prove more than one author if a writer today can write a preface to the rd edition and years later a preface to the th edition then why can an original author not have appended his own gospel in terms of the gospel fictions arguments helms offers one of the ones he used before including the story again as in the first book that the cana watertowine miracle was stolen from dionysus again as we noted the literary evidence could only point to theft the other way around he also claims that the raising of lazarus was a story stolen from a myth of the egyptian osiris glenn miller tells us that the reference to this resurrection i cannot find anywhere in the scholarly literature i have looked under all forms of the name to no avail the fact that something so striking is not even mentioned in modern works of egyptology indicates its questionable status helms cites the work of budge but the parallels he draws are quite questionable bethany is the same as house of anu because house  beth in hebrew that might be worth a look if there werent an actual bethany in existence and it means house of dates whereas the egyptian anu was one of their gods the only real argument for a late date for john is the synagogue expulsion argument we have covered here great attention is devoted to the secret gospel of mark but as noted above the rest of the world of biblical scholarship doesnt share the same opinion helms bases an argument on the thesis that after  christianity was rapidly becoming a gentile religion but he should first consult and refute rodneys starks findings inthe rise of christianity which strongly indicate that the jewish mission carried on with some strength even into the time of bar kochba s ad acts  which mentions offhand that apollos was from alexandria is magnified into a proof that alexandria was the home of a primitive community of christians who were not saddled with things like baptism and speaking in tongues and acts  is a polemic against them while the original signs gospel was a polemic against the other church there were other subtle polemtics too johns gospel was written as a polemic against peter for example the fact that only in john is judas iscariot referred to as a son of simon is a polemic against simon peter i do not suppose the fact that simon was the most common name of jewish men at this time had anything to do with that so is the scene where john outruns peter to the tomb  yet peter is allowed in first  and where john is allowed into the house of the high priest while peter waits outside our conclusion helms clearly lacks the discipline knowledge or fortitude to write on this subject with authority the same would be said of any writer who thinks  pages and  sources is enough to address such a complex issue and our examples of his errors serve as confirmation of this jph helm construction  helms new apartments at st lukes sold out within hours of being on the market monday to friday   freephone    home what
