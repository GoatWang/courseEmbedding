freightscan llc which specializes in technology solutions for the freight and logistics industry has added new functionality to its freightscan fs automated dimensioning system for cargo scanning the new features include the ability to use a barcode reader to trigger a scan and the ability to remotely trigger the scanning system using a universal barcode reader the fs captures the information from the bar code automatically populates the air waybill field and triggers a scan—all in less than one second the resulting dimensions are then associated with the correct air waybill in a database in addition to the barcode functionality freightscan has also developed a powerful thinclient data solution that allows for a simplified wireless user interface to trigger a scan remotely from the fs terminal this feature was designed for cargo operations utilizing forklift scales and facilities with operational functions that benefit from triggering a scan from the pc terminal without interfering with the work flow process utilizing dimm tech defined imaging and multiple measurement technology the freightscan fs system enables cargo and logistics companies to collect accurate and reliable dimensions it then calculates chargeable weight for multiple packages in all configurations with a single scan in a matter of seconds the system additionally captures a digital and laser image for  percent of scanned freight and incorporates that visual record with every waybill the freightscan fs system is compact and installs virtually anywhere in a warehouse  feet off the floor to streamline the dimming process and maximize warehouse resources it is capable of scanning a onelot shipment in four seconds and a multilot shipment in six to eight seconds delivering individual dims for each
