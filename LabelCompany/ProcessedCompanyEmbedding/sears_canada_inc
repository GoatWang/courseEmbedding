company was to have two main objectives the first was to expand simpsons mail order business which was sold to the new company the second goal was to build a string of stores modelled on sears roebucks format across the country the agreement also contained a provision that would prove to be a major challenge in later years under its terms simpsonssears could not open a retail store within  miles of simpsons existing stores in toronto montreal halifax regina and london in return simpsons promised not to build any stores outside of those five cities simpsonssears mail order business however was free to operate anywhere in canada as was the new simpsonssears acceptance company the credit arm of the operation the business operations of simpsonssears began when the first

confusing customers used to simpsons new stores were opened under the sears banner all existing simpsonssears stores were rebranded to the sears banner as well however the name of the company remained simpsonssears limited also in  sears achieved its first billiondollar sales year in  simpsonssears opened a sears store at hillcrest mall in richmond hill ontario its first location in a mall that had a simpsons store store warsedit in  simpsons and simpsonssears put forward a plan to merge their businesses this plan had to have approval of the foreign investment review agency as sears roebuck would become the prime shareholder before approval could be attained the hudson’s bay company made a counter bid and acquired simpsons limited simpsons’ shares in simpsonssears taken over by the bay were eventually sold back to sears roebuck the company was renamed sears canada inc in  to reflect its independence the sears store in fairview mall toronto one of the stores acquired from simpsons in  the paths of hudson’s bay and sears crossed again in  the hudsons bay company merged its remaining greater toronto simpsons stores into its the bay division in  and the simpsons name disappeared from canadas retail landscape as a result of this move sears canada took over eight former simpsons and bay stores and finally gained a major foothold in greater toronto a market from which it had been excluded by the  agreement with simpsons these new stores featured a new  fashionshardlines mix and introduced new boutique shop arrangements and fashion lines such as le chateau sung and rouie sears

history sears canada gained the leases to a number of prime downtown locations in toronto eaton centre vancouver victoria winnipeg ottawa and calgary all former eatons flagship stores the simpsonssears agreement had largely shut out sears from the urban core and that remained so even when the restriction was lifted as the bay and eatons long held a duopoly in the downtowns of major canadian cities sears canada had also entertained notions of obtaining the former eaton downtown montreal store but that location was eventually occupied by quebec retailer les ailes de la mode sears relaunched eatons rendered with the lowercase e logo in november  as a sevenstore upscale minibrand with locations in vancouver victoria calgary winnipeg toronto eaton centre and yorkdale and ottawa all of which had been flagship eaton stores at yorkdale and winnipegs polo park this meant that sears canada managed two anchor stores eatons and sears in those malls for a short time this operation was unsuccessful however and sears converted the eatons stores to the sears brand in  many saidwho that the eatons stores were too upscale andor too thinly scattered across the country for the minichain to have ever been profitable and worthwhile the retail environment has changed with more of the population shopping at big box outlets and specialty stores squeezing out the middle market

objectives the first was to expand simpsons mail order business which was sold to the new company the second goal was to build a string of stores modelled on sears roebucks format across the country the agreement also contained a provision that would prove to be a major challenge in later years under its terms simpsonssears could not open a retail store within  miles of simpsons existing stores in toronto montreal halifax regina and london in return simpsons promised not to build any stores outside of those five cities simpsonssears mail order business however was free to operate anywhere in canada as was the new simpsonssears acceptance company the credit arm of the operation the business operations of simpsonssears began when the first simpsonssears springsummer catalogue was printed by

kamloops british columbia in december of that year in  simpsonssears opened canada’s first large suburban department store in vancouver – burnaby bc based on new the modern sears roebuck model spreading across the us simpsonssears introduced “we service what we sell” in  a slogan backed up by a highly trained nationwide corps of service technicians in  simpsonssears opened its first fullline store in quebec in quebec city’s fleur de lys complex the company made its public debut on the toronto and montreal stock exchanges on april   with the listing of its class “a” nonvoting

achieved its first billiondollar sales year in  simpsonssears opened a sears store at hillcrest mall in richmond hill ontario its first location in a mall that had a simpsons store store warsedit in  simpsons and simpsonssears put forward a plan to merge their businesses this plan had to have approval of the foreign investment review agency as sears roebuck would become the prime shareholder before approval could be attained the hudson’s bay company made a counter bid and acquired simpsons limited simpsons’ shares in simpsonssears taken over by the bay were eventually sold back to sears roebuck the company was renamed sears canada inc in  to reflect its independence the sears store in fairview mall toronto one of the stores acquired from simpsons in  the paths of hudson’s bay and sears crossed again in  the hudsons bay company merged its remaining greater toronto simpsons stores into its the bay division in  and the simpsons name disappeared from canadas retail landscape as a result of this move sears canada took over eight former simpsons and bay stores and finally gained a major foothold in greater toronto a market from which it had been excluded by the  agreement with simpsons these new stores featured a new  fashionshardlines mix and introduced new boutique shop arrangements and fashion lines such as le chateau sung and rouie sears announced the store of the

the leases to a number of prime downtown locations in toronto eaton centre vancouver victoria winnipeg ottawa and calgary all former eatons flagship stores the simpsonssears agreement had largely shut out sears from the urban core and that remained so even when the restriction was lifted as the bay and eatons long held a duopoly in the downtowns of major canadian cities sears canada had also entertained notions of obtaining the former eaton downtown montreal store but that location was eventually occupied by quebec retailer les ailes de la mode sears relaunched eatons rendered with the lowercase e logo in november  as a sevenstore upscale minibrand with locations in vancouver victoria calgary winnipeg toronto eaton centre and yorkdale and ottawa all of which had been flagship eaton stores at yorkdale and winnipegs polo park this meant that sears canada managed two anchor stores eatons and sears in those malls for a short time this operation was unsuccessful however and sears converted the eatons stores to the sears brand in  many saidwho that the eatons stores were too upscale andor too thinly scattered across the country for the minichain to have ever been profitable and worthwhile the retail environment has changed with more of the population shopping at big box outlets and specialty stores squeezing out the middle market which is the base of the traditional
