lastbywilliam d curnutton december  this stephen cannell novel is  in the shane scully series and will be the last the novel is shorter than the other novels and probably reflects the fact that cannell passed away recently whether this was finished by a ghost writer or not it still keeps the flavor of cannells writing and is an appropriate finality for the seriesscully and hitchens his partner are attached to the special homicide division of the lapd they are called out to take over a case involving the death of a high profile individual who has been a thorn in the side of the department for years her death will bring with it a higher amount of scrutiny because so many police officers are happy that she is deadbut what makes this even more dangerous turf is the fact that nix nixon from vigilante tv has picked up the scent of the case and wants to use it as his third season project his program is not one favored by police departments because he thinks that the police are inept an he does his best to discredit them while solving the case before them thus shaming the detectives and the department that he profilesscully and hitchens are going to be dogged at every step of the investigation by nix and his tv crew what makes it even harder is the fact that several former police officers a former fbi agent and a former attorney from the das office are now working with nix on his show and do their best to also influence the public into thinking that the police departments are not doing their jobthis case is going to go through several twists and turns as the investigation heats up nix is going to do his best to send the detectives off in the wrong direction while solving the case himself he also adds to the mix a cold case that is several years old that he claims he can also solve before the lapdthe stakes keep getting higher in this investigation it appears that there may be two police officers involved high ranking ones that will make this even more dangerous political turf for the detectives to walkthe killer also may have a desire to polish off the detectives before they get to closethe ride is a good one as we follow the detectives through their paces of trying to solve two cases and keep ahead of a tv show that wants to embarrass themi felt the plot was good the characters well developed and you found a good novel that shows the moral failures of both citizens and police officers as they let evil take control of their livesi enjoyed the novel and am grateful for a good read it is just sad that cannell is not with us any

i was so shocked when i heard that stephen j cannell had died i felt like i had lost a member of my own family i happened to be trolling the new release section on amazon and saw this book vigilante was being released in december i was thrilled i immediately put in my advance order and couldnt wait to read the final book in the shane scully series in fact when it arrived i hesitated on reading it right away as i wanted it to last a long timeso when i finally started reading vigilante i was a bit confused it wasnt that long ago that i had read the prostitutes ball did i remember the characters ever behaving this way was this really the shane scully and his beautiful wife alexa head of the homicide detective division that i had grown to love and admire what happened to them making love at least  times per book and their meaningful collaborations where is their beloved son chooch who was barely a footnote in this entire bookwhen did shane start feeling like everyone had more than him why didnt he pet his cat more since when was shane concerned about his career when he was always like a stinger missile locked on a targeti felt the plot for vigilante could have been exciting and a great finale of a great series by an extraordinary writer instead i felt a bit ripped off like someone else either wrote this book or finished this from an outline or draft this has happened with several authors dick francis who handed over his empire to his son felix and the ludlum series the robert b parker series etc and all of these books had an additional author name on them the exception being the parker seriesi lost count of the number of times shane said i think were being set up well i feel like i was set up i feel that if someone else assisted in writing this book the fans should know this and then consider it when deciding to purchase the bookone of the things i always admired about cannells books were the exciting twists and turns and the obscure references that a police insider would know this book was predictable mildly exciting and for me a sad let down i feel just awful giving this book a  the only other book he wrote that i didnt like was a stand alone book called at first sightif vigilante was truly written  by mr cannell before he passed away i would love to know this it is quite possible that if he did write this he probably wasnt feeling that well and i would then look at this book in an entirely different lightif you have never read one of stephen cannells books i would highly recommend going back to the beginning and reading the scully series in orderits great to read how the characters evolved over the years and most of the stories were fantastic his other stand alone novels were great toomr cannell rest in peaceand thank you for all the

cannells books in series the characters are constant in every book enabling the reader to become familiar with each of them over time when characters are constant the narrative becomes more personal

expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered

covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early
