and countertrend liquidations are defined as follows      pattern recognition is the ability to identify patterns that appear to have acted as precursors of price advances or declines in the past      a support level is a previous low—a price level under the current market price at which point buying interest is expected to be sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure      a resistance level is a previous high—a price level over the current market price at which point selling pressure is expected to overcome buying pressure and a price advance is expected to be turned back      a

is a multistrategy  statistical and systematic program that seeks to identify prevailing market conditions and adopt the most efficient trading strategy for those conditions the strategy at times

     winton trades its diversified program on behalf of winton master the diversified program trades approximately  futures and forward contracts on united states and non united states exchanges and markets      winton employs a fully systematic computerized technical trendfollowing trading system developed by its principals this system tracks the daily price movements from these markets around the world and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long           or short the portfolio should be in an attempt to maximize profit within a certain range of risk if rising prices in a particular market are anticipated a long position will be established in that market if prices in a particular market are expected to fall a short position in that market will be established      technical analysis refers to analysis based on data intrinsic to a market such as price and volume in contrast fundamental analysis relies on factors external to a market such as supply and demand the diversified program employs no fundamental factors      a trendfollowing system is one that attempts to take advantage of the observable tendency of the markets to trend and to tend to make exaggerated movements in both upward and downward directions as a result of such trends these exaggerated movements are largely explained as a result of the influence of crowd psychology or the “herd instinct” among market participants      a trendfollowing system does not anticipate a trend in fact trendfollowing systems are frequently unprofitable for long periods of time in particular markets or market groups and occasionally they are unprofitable for periods of more than a year however the principals believe that such an approach will in the long term be profitable      trade selection is not subject to intervention by winton’s principals and therefore is not subject to the influences of individual judgment as a mechanical trading system the winton model embodies all the expert knowledge required to analyze market data and direct trades thus eliminating the risk of basing a trading program on one indispensable person equally as important is the fact that mechanical systems can be tested in simulation for long periods of time and the model’s empirical characteristics can be measured      the system’s output is rigorously adhered to in trading the portfolio and intentionally no importance is given to any external or fundamental factors while it may be seen as unwise to ignore information of obvious value such as that pertaining to political or economic developments winton believes that the disadvantage of this approach is far outweighed by the advantage of the discipline that rigorous adherence to such a system instills winton believes that significant profits may be realized by the winton system by holding on to positions for much longer than conventional wisdom would dictate winton believes that a trader who pays attention to daytoday events could be distracted from the chance of fully capitalizing on such trends      the winton system trades in all liquid us and nonus futures and forward contracts forward markets include major currencies and precious and base metals the latter two categories being traded on the london metal exchange winton seeks out new opportunities to add additional markets to the portfolio with the goal of increasing the portfolio’s diversification      winton believes that taking positions in a variety of unrelated markets will over time decrease system volatility by employing a sophisticated and systematic method for placing orders in a wide array of markets winton believes that profits can be realized over time       aaa capital management adviors ltd      aaa trades its energy program on

program an account’s size volatility of the market traded and the nature of other positions taken are all factors used in deciding whether to initiate a position and in determining the amount of equity committed to that position while sandridge relies heavily on fundamental research to develop its overall point of view it also employs technical analysis in its trading to help determine entry and exit points technical analysis includes moving averages index rolls and stochasticrelative strength indicators technical analysis is based on the theory that the study of the markets themselves provides a means of anticipating price movements sandridge may employ various strategies for phasing an account in and out of the markets entry points are based on a number of price breakout and retracement indicators position exits are based on multiple strategies including trailing stops target prices and technical reversals if sandridge believes that the markets traded are unstable sandridge may temporarily reduce positions or exit the markets entirely and therefore hold no open positions for a period of time sandridge estimates that generally  to  of the partnership’s assets allocated to sandridge will be committed to margin at any one time the actual amount committed as such may be substantially more trading decisions will require the exercise of judgment by sandridge      sandridge’s success depends to a great extent upon the occurrence of market conditions favorable to its trading strategy factors such as lack of major price trends or increased governmental

relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the partnership while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred during the

commodity interests that the advisors believes are traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions sufficient volume in this context refers to a level of liquidity that the advisor believes will permit it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market       ii   an advisor will not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these positions would result in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than   of the partnership’s net assets allocated to that advisor       iii   the partnershipfunds may occasionally accept delivery of a commodity unless such delivery is disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse the physical commodity position is fully hedged       iv   the partnershipfunds do not employ the trading technique commonly known as “pyramiding” in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities       v   the partnershipfunds do not utilize borrowings other than shortterm borrowings if the partnershipfunds take delivery of any cash commodities               vi   the advisors may from time to time employ trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the partnershipfunds the term “spread” or “straddle” describes a commodity futures trading strategy involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets and in which the trader expects to earn a profit from a widening or narrowing of the difference between the prices of the two contracts       vii   the partnershipfunds will not permit the churning of its

to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash through physical delivery or with another financial instrument these instruments may be traded on an exchange or overthecounter “otc” exchange traded instruments are standardized and include futures and certain forwards and option contracts otc contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include swaps and certain forwards and option contracts each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those relating to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk in general the risks associated with otc contracts are greater than those associated with exchange traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an otc contract      market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the partnershipfunds due to market changes including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded the partnershipfunds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short      credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract the partnership’sfunds’ risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition and not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments the partnership’sfunds’ risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the partnershipfunds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events the partnershipfunds have credit risk and concentration risk as the sole counterparty or broker with respect to the partnership’sfunds’ assets is cgm or a cgm affiliate credit risk with

the funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option written options expose the funds to potentially unlimited liability for purchased options the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference

     the general partnermanaging member monitors and attempts to control the partnership’sfunds’ risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit and risk management monitoring systems and

liquidity under the fully automated system changes in market prices are forecast over a number of future periods and the portfolio is optimized to take best advantage of these forecasts forecasts are derived from a number of quantitative market phenomena for instance directional movement components look for persistent upward or downward price movements over a number of timescales and antitrending components are invoked when such movements may have gone too far too fast other inputs are derived from changes in perceived instrument volatility and the effect of one market against another closely correlated one under the trading system the relevant return forecasts together with their corresponding measures of risk and market correlation are reestimated daily portfolio resources are then allocated to where the approach expects significant changes in prices bearing in mind the need to diversify exposure to risk as a result portfolio composition is not fixed there are no preassigned weightings to markets or sectors moreover no one market is treated differently to its peers in terms of parameter inputs due to the number of inputs or indicators used and their application across a

instruments these financial instruments include forwards futures options and swaps whose values are based upon an underlying asset index or reference rate and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified terms at specified future dates or in the case of derivative commodity instruments to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash through physical delivery or with another financial instrument these instruments may be traded on an exchange or overthecounter otc exchangetraded instruments are standardized and include futures and certain forwards and option contracts otc contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include swaps and certain forwards and option contracts each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those relating to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk in general the risks associated with otc contracts are greater than those associated with exchangetraded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an otc contract the general partner estimates that at any given time approximately  to  of the partnershipfunds contracts are traded otc the risk to the limited partners that have purchased redeemable units is limited to the amount of their share of the partnerships assets and undistributed profits this limited liability is a result of the organization of the partnership as a limited partnership under new york law market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the partnershipfunds due to market changes including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded by the partnershipfunds the partnershipfunds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract the partnershipsfunds risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition and not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments the partnershipsfunds risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the partnershipfunds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events the partnershipfunds have credit risk and concentration risk as cgmms  co or a cgm affiliate is the sole counterparty or broker with respect to the partnershipsfunds assets credit risk with respect to exchangetraded instruments is reduced to the extent that through cgm and ms  co the partnershipsfunds counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization as both a buyer and seller of options the funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option written options expose the funds to potentially unlimited liability for purchased options the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset the funds do not consider these contracts to be guarantees the general partner monitors and attempts to control the partnershipsfunds risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit and risk management monitoring systems and accordingly believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the partnershipfunds may be subject these monitoring systems generally allow the general partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with riskadjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics in addition online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures forwards and options positions by sector margin requirements gain and loss transactions and collateral positions see also item

input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety management has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace the funds level  assets and liabilities are actively traded accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap also requires the need to use judgment in determining if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has become inactive management has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace there has not been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in the partnerships and the funds level  assets and liabilities the partnership and the funds will separately present purchases sales issuances and settlements in their reconciliation of level  fair value measurements ie to present such items on a gross basis rather than on a net basis and make disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either level  or level  of the fair value hierarchy as required under gaap effective january   the partnership adopted accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs the amendments within this asu changed the wording used to describe many of the gaap requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to eliminate unnecessary wording differences between gaap and ifrs however some of the amendments clarified the financial accounting standards boards the fasb intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and other amendments changed a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements this new guidance did not have a significant impact on the partnerships financial statements the partnership and the funds consider prices for exchangetraded commodity futures forwards and options contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level  the values of nonexchangetraded forwards swaps and certain options contracts for which market quotations are not readily available are
