make distributions of income and capital on each specified distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next distribution date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus  the estimated annual income per unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trusts initial offering period and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter this amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends the actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in dividends and distributions received currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities the actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trusts life  the portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the unitholders basis in the units and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors as of the close of business day prior to initial date of deposit the actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the portfolios fees and expenses in actual income received by the portfolio currency fluctuations and with changes in the portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities important information about benchmarks about risk there is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective an investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them this trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trusts life except in limited circumstances accordingly you can lose money investing in this trust the trust should be considered as part of a longterm investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts if available you will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time there can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will remain at current levels or increase over time the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period you could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as units are sold there is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the portfolios profits and losses investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with

securities which pay income quarterly this portfolio is structured to pay monthly income if any offering investors a potential regular stream of current income conveniencepreferred securities can be difficult for an individual investor to analyze and select because of their unique structure this portfolio offers the convenience of a professionally selected portfolio of preferred securities diversificationbecause the portfolio invests in a variety of preferred securities in several different industry sectors and with different credit quality investors may gain an added level of

concerning your individual situation  there is no assurance that income distributions from the portfolio will be qualified dividends for federal tax purposes in addition certain holding period requirements must be satisfied for investors to be eligible to take advantage of the lower tax rate on qualified dividend income and there is no tax advantage to investors who hold units in retirement accounts under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the portfolio may also be subject to an additional  tax for investors exceeding certain income thresholds invesco and

preceding record date provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next distribution date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus  the estimated annual income per unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trusts initial offering period and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter this amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends the actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in dividends and distributions received currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities the actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trusts life  the portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the unitholders basis in the units and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors as of the close of business day prior to initial date of deposit the actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated

benchmarks about risk there is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective an investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them this trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust’s life except in limited circumstances accordingly you can lose money investing in this trust the trust should be considered as part of a longterm investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts if available you will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next an investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated with an investment in a portfolio of preferred securities such as the inability of the issuer to pay the principal of or income on a security when due volatile interest rates early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the securities the value of preferred securities may fall if interest rates in general rise given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on preferred income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future an issuer may be unable to make dividend or interest payments in the future this may result in a reduction in the value of your units the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period you could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as units are sold there is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the portfolios profits and losses the portfolio will receive early returns of principal if securities are called or sold before the portfolio termination if this happens your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield in addition the value of your units may decline if any portfolio securities trading at a premium are called at par certain preferred securities in the portfolio are rated below investment grade and considered to be junk or highyield securities securities rated below bbb by standard and poors or below baa by moodys are considered to be below investment grade these securities are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks accordingly the risk of default is higher than with investment grade securities in addition these securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal the portfolio invests solely in preferred and debt securities preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore are subject to greater risk than those debt instruments in addition to the other risks described herein income payments on most preferreds are
