japanese spiritjapanese shochu  is a distilled spirit that is remarkably smooth and light with delicate earthy notes seldom found in western spirits these distinctive flavors are a tribute to the local harvests  typically barley sweet potato sugar cane or rice  and are rooted in a deep appreciation for the purity and perfection found in nature to capture the true essence of these ingredients ‘honkaku’ authentic style shochu is distilled only one time the traditional method of single distillation preserves and highlights the naturally occurring oils and aromas that deliver the spirit’s unfamiliar yet exquisite flavorstoday there are roughly  working distilleries producing over  unique brands of shochu in japan most of these are scattered throughout the pristine countryside on the island of kyushu once perceived to be oldfashioned an old man’s liquor shochu is now the favorite of a younger generation of japanese drinkers it has even become more popular than sake an ongoing trend that has been fueled by both men and women in their ’s and ’s who are rediscovering the complexities of the  year old spirit some of the appeal has been brought on by a number of reported healthrelated benefits most notably that shochu has a lower calorie count when compared to other spirits the “sho” character  means fired or burned and the “chu” character  means to concentrate giving the meaning that shochu is a type of alcohol concentrated by fire  nehan spirits llc  retailing falowitz formdscom  sec filings of fundraisings and investments in hedge funds private equity firms
