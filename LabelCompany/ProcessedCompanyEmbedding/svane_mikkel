from mikkel svane founder and ceo zendesk madanmohan rao  june  shares the story of zendesk from startup to ipo is well captured in the page book ‘startup land how three guys risked everything to turn an idea into a global business’ by mikkel svane founder and ceo“we succeeded because we worked hard we cracked some problems early and we didn’t give up when the weather changed” begins mikkel he shares some of the lessons learned along their journey but cautions that there is no clearcut recipe “there is no formula for success the world moves too fast for any formula to last” he warnshere are my key takeaways from the book for startup founders and aspiring entrepreneurs see also my review of the books startup of you by linkedin founder reid hoffman and things a little bird told me confessions of the creative mind by twitter cofounder biz stone believe in what you do—even if the path ahead is unclear mikkel and his team loved creating useful things for people products which simplified difficult tasks the team found motivation and meaning in bringing clean design to the industry though they were initially far from silicon valley they founded their company in a tiny loft in copenhagen believing that they could still bring change and value to the customer support industrythe path ahead was not just unclear but also unpredictable and even seemed precarious for the cofounders the steps ahead were confusing and even unstable but the team stuck together “startups are fragile” mikkel cautions when you are charting really new territory the journey can be “fascinating and terrifying at the same time” sometimes you have to trust your intuition and sometimes you go against it and trust whatever is ahead of you boring is sexy zendesk wanted to improve the way customer service was done and the way customer service products were sold in the presaas era at a time when customers bought software without fully seeing it or testing it and took  months to make it work after much sweat and complications much of it revolved around telephonebased call centresmikkel and team came up with a less expensive solution that could be delivered over the web and was easier to use “sexy stuff sometimes happens when you make mundane things easy and accessible boring is sexy” he explains perseverance “there are no shortcuts you have to constantly take the hard route” says mikkel the route is not straight forward either it can be a “meandering upanddown and backandforth journey”“nothing that is worthwhile is easy and nothing is more fun” he says there will also be asymmetry and unevenness between cofounders in terms of how much work each puts in at different stages of the journey timing is everything zendesk started off by using terms such as ‘love your help desk’ and ‘tender loving customer care’ at a time when such ideas were totally new the rise of the web gave them a chance to show this could work for customers around the world fortunately the saas trend would pick up and validate this model and consumer internet trends began to sweep through enterprises the issue of timing would also surface in a different way years later just before zendesk’s ipo in  valuations of saas companies began to drop—but they went ahead with their ipo anyway without postponing it starting parttime is ok but challenging you don’t have to quit everything to begin work on a startup mikkel and his team had consulting jobs which kept the money flowing in this helped build and market the first version of their product see my review of the related book originals by adam grant some cofounders expected to be paid while working on the startup others didn’t “people can live with different risk profiles you have to accept that and not let that come between you” mikkel advises “keeping everyone committed was a nightmare this was the biggest challenge of doing a startup” he recalls get the pitch right when zendesk first decided to pitch at for a techcrunch conference they didn’t get the story right they were used to having the product speak for itself but to scale to a wider audience they had to explain the domain the problem their product and its benefits to appeal to investors they would also have to go beyond the ‘lowhanging fruit’ to the broader market the soul of the company is more important than investor funds the first potential investor in zendesk made all kinds of demands on the founding team and seemed to be trying to weaken them so as to get a better negotiating position great investors build unique relationships with founders and retain them as leaders but bad investors try work around the founders amateur investors are shortsighted and only want to improve their own position cautions mikkelthey turned away this investor and instead raised money from family and friends it is important to set their expectations appropriately and pitch the opportunity as a lottery ticket without influence on the company mikkel advises build relationships with good investors and lawyers “working with a vc is almost like entering into a marriage it’s a longterm proposition and you lose the complete control you once had over your own destiny” says mikkel fortunately for zendesk they found a good series a investor in devdutt yellurkar partner at charles river venturesthough they rejected his first offer he kept the door open for them to reopen negotiations the conditions included a move to the us for the founding team “we definitely had more ideas and vision than we had resources and capacity but that’s the charm of an early startup there’s no ceiling for your ambitions” recalls mikkel but dilution of stakes is part of the scale game and this should be done in a manner acceptable to all founders have to open up completely to investors to earn their trust and learn about the investors’ strategy and portfolio you also need to learn how to “love and live with lawyers” advises mikkel build good customer relationships customer support is built from the inside of a company right from culture to communication building a good relationship is more important than just hardsell call customers proactively even before there is a problemcustomers expect empathy transparency a human face and multichannel connection go from mere responses to engaging conversations handcrafted emails even with spelling mistakes seem to draw more responses than templatised emails for male audiences a female persona gets more responses “companies need to face the new realities of the customer economy” mikkel urges customer service is now a very public experience thanks to the internet and social media it is no longer just about one transaction and it no longer happens in a vacuumcustomers share their good and bad stories with the whole world a good customer experience turns them into promoters “a good relationship has to be earned every day customers who leave teach you about who you are but also who you are not” says mikkel from idealist to realist learn from mistakes if customers rant about bad service it actually shows they have much passion for your product that they care to give feedback about it zendesk once increased its prices in an inappropriate manner and drew flak and bad press the ceo apologised for the mistreatment they even made tshirts out of the critical comments as reminders of customer centricity the tshirts are still worn today scale build a team office and culture “one of the great things about building a smart team is that it forces you to grow yourself” says mikkel the general practice is ‘hire for attitude train the skills’ designing the office space is also a challenge “it’s hard to balance ego and humility to balance a desire for quality with a desire for simplicity and balance modesty with the needs for attracting talent” he explainsget feedback but not all decisions have to be democratic when it comes to office design graffiti games and pets sound cool but they have their own issues as well “and finally kiss your office space goodbye you’ll move within a few years” jokes mikkel “we were looking for people who could interact in a semicrazy environment and have fun we didn’t want new hires to come with lots of demands” he says hire people who are multitalented adventurous openminded curious frank diverse and have traveled a lotteam members should respect trust and like each other—that sounds banal but true and tough to implement scandinavians are generally modest people so the hiring process was a bit of culture shock due to the american propensity for bravado grandiosity and exaggeration in resumes and interviewsmanagement structures keep changing as the company grows and sometimes you also have to let go of people who have been with you for a long while but are not the best in scale stage “hiring people who are way smarter than you and who have a lot more experience is actually really hard and it’s something you have to learn” says mikkel founders also have to become more “official and upstanding” and not just their goofy selves they have to more carefully watch what they say in full public glare “unless you are steve jobs ceos are not supposed to allude to recreational drug use” mikkel jokes give back to the community “we believe in the concept of an urban campus” says mikkel employees are encouraged to eat outside and support local eateries it initially used to provide free meals the company helps improve the quality of the neighbourhood as well for example after the ipo  employees of the san francisco office took to the streets to clean up the place parts of the world like silicon valley have more mobility risktaking culture and a willingness to keep trying things till they succeed it is important to spread such elements to other ecosystems as well the ipo is a goal—and a new beginning seven years after being founded in copenhagen zendesk went public on  may  on the new york stock exchange the process is a distraction and diversion—but also matures and strengthens the company recalls mikkel founders must win the confidence of investors who are looking for the passion and people behind the business“the ipo was just the first step in our journey to becoming a nextgeneration enterprise software company” says mikkel the ipo also affects the employees who build lives around the stock price failure is tough—but start over again in the s inspired by the growth of the internet in the us after a california trip mikkel launched his first startup a web portal in denmark called forumdk the portal was sold to a newspaper and a company was started around the product called by a rather unfortunate name caput the startup literally went kaput after the dotcom bust of “failure is not something to be proud of but failure is something you can recover from” says mikkel “my first failure was so tough because i had no perspective i was ripped out of the reality i knew and thrown into a new reality” he says it was terrible not to be able to pay bills to fire people and not deliver on customer promises—but mikkel found new colleagues to move on and eventually found zendesk “if you are building a company or thinking about building a company never forget that relationships are the most important building block it’s the only way to build a lasting business—and a fantastic life” mikkel

mikkel svane alright prefect thank you marc and good evening good afternoon everybody along with completing a first  solid first quarter of results we also made major progress across our long term growth opportunities in new products in industry integrations and in international expansion you can read much more about that in our shareholder letter we believe we are in a good position for  to maintain the strength of our transactional business as we continue our enterprise class business here i would particularly like to highlight our recent progress in expanding our product family just this week we launched zendesk guide its a new smart knowledge base solution and evolution of our current help center functionality that is part of our call center product but comes with new features new functionality and new capabilities and of course opens additional monetization opportunities for us guide capitalizes on the desires of consumers of customer today to help themselves and we do that by giving them a smart selfservice support solution powered by machine learning also today we are announcing our acquisition of outbound and welcoming the full team in the zendesk family outbound believes that customers today experiences and expect communication to build around them not being built around the business or the business department outbound focuses on making those types of communication much more relevant at a time where customers are updated with messages from brands by using outbound businesses can automate and deliver relevant messages across web across email and mobile channels and can measure of the effectiveness of those messages shifting the focus from the quality of messages delivered to the to the quality of customer attractions so outbound really complements our vision for zendesk connect which we have about on earlier calls with connects were working on making communication with customers much more proactive and predictive throughout the customer experience we learned a lot from our own customers who are already using outbound and we decided that working to combine outbound and connect into a single product would offer our customers the best experience and that is now quickly realize our regional vision for connect so well be working on an integrated product while we continue to offer outbound to new customers and support its current customers its been almost exactly one year to the day today since elena bryan elena our cfo bryan our cro chief revenue officer and tom our cio joined zendesk and joined the management team over the past four months we have invested we have laid the ground work for future success and we have today the team the product portfolio the customer base and the rapid pace of innovation in place for successful year and to keep us on cause to reach out  billion revenue target in  our financial outlook for fullyear  reflects our strong position and remains strong we expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million for the full year none of the opportunities that we have ahead of us would be possible without our customers and without our employees we ended the first quarter with more than  paid customer accounts its a great milestone for us and we also have more than  employees worldwide i would like to thank all of them our customers our employees you guys for the continued support and for making contributions toward our growth and with that back to marc marc cabi rob we will open it up right for questions please questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question comes from line of bhavan suri from william blair your line is open bhavan suri thank you hey guys do you hear me okay mikkel svane we can hi bhavan bhavan suri great hi and congratulation before i jump on the financial i just have a quick question for mikkel on zendesk guide as you look at that product is there specific segments that youre targeting and how should we think about the asp lift the product could have it seems like an extension of your core help center offering but inclusion of ai so where do you see these are playing out alongside the core also we like get sort of how thats position not just as a product but also which customers you target ph mikkel svane so we will retain some very basic help center capabilities across support products but we will focus all our investments and the continued kind of development of these capabilities in the guide product that makes a lot of sense for many different reasons it will also help us much better towards our customers kind of produce the value statements then makes it obvious for them while guide actually and why selfservice and why providing smart selfservice options makes a lot of sense for that business so it really helps us focus our value statements our value proposal around that product and of course add some monetization opportunity all to all across customer the option of kind of these kind of selfservice capabilities are very broad across our customer base whether you work with technical support or whether you work with consumer support you want to give this seamless customer experience where you almost predictive in your capabilities to kind of provide the wide answer to the customer so its a very broad opportunity and we look very much forwards testing it with new customers and move on from a revenue perspective obviously with all of our products we launch and let them evolve over time but there will be some difference subscription models around guide and especially how ai and ml work within the guide product for selfservice and delivering correct answers which will elaborate a little bit more on as we go forward but there are lots of good subscription opportunities as the product evolves bhavan suri got it thats really helpful and then a quick followup for me its been a little bit of time now since you have changed subscription package pricing can you speak to how that impacted sort of average seat count for customer you know that gone up and sort of could you just remind where average seat counts arethank you mikkel svane so we havent really described average seat counts because of the large customer base with the long tail what i would say is that in general we are beginning to do more and more with larger companies and larger opportunities within either existing customer or new customers so we would expect our average to move up over time based on that activity but again averages are really difficult to kind of certain in q specifically we highlighted this in the letter its a very transactional more of an smb small business kind of quarter and so that kind of plays out in those results bhavan suri great thats really helpful guys thanks for my questions there and nice job mikkel svane thank you bhavan operator your next question comes from the line of jesse hulsing from goldman sachs your line is open jesse hulsing yeah thank you i wanted to touch a little bit on the enterprise or big or bigger customer part of your business the mix was flat quarteroverquarter at  and thats somewhat backwards looking im curious what are you seeing on the enterprise side and i know you guys went through some sales hashed and rehashed that multiple times about how do you feel about where the sales organization that as you as you finish up the first quarter and get into the second quarter elena gomez jesse i can take that so we feel very confident that the majority of the sales reorganize behind us and brian done a nice job of retaining the top talent that we have in terms of the new talent that is being onboard and obviously that takes some time to ramp but we continue to feel that our pipeline is showing good signs of larger deals and we think of those as you know seasonally to show up more in the back half of the year jesse hulsing got it and can you update us on your unicorn concentration i guess you want to call it that one of your software peers have some issues this week with uber starting to end source part of their provided functionality are you seeing anything similar and do you see that as any sort of risk to your business thank you mikkel svane so we havent really updated percentage of revenue that comes from socalled unicorn is only because we need a finite list to compare against to create that revenue number and the wall street journal it has created a new list for us to compare against with certain customers different companies including ourselves have to contend with the fact that once in a while they build in some futures that they might have taken from outside but we feel very confident with our large customers in that category that we have really good working relationships with them and will participate in their future growth jesse hulsing thank you mike mikkel svane thanks operator your next question comes from the line of stan zlotsky from morgan stanley your line is open stan zlotsky hey guys thank you so much for taking my question so maybe just to start off as you went through q and the results came together did anything surprise you either positive or negative is to how that the results came together in the quarter elena gomez we had a really nice pickup at the end of the quarter as it relates to our low transactional business which was obviously great news but other than that no major surprises for us stan zlotsky got it thank you and maybe just small followup the  retention what was a pretty good result in line with what we saw in q what is driving your upsell now and in addition to that if you were to strip that upsell how has your gross retention rate been trending in recent quarters thats it for me thank you elena gomez yes so the majority of our expansion continues to come from existing installs adding more agents as well as moving up to a different plan but we are starting to see with multiproduct more cross sell our customers as our customers are adopting more of our products and well continue to see that move in terms of our retention i can tell you that our churning contraction combine has remained steady stan zlotsky perfect thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of brendan barnicle from pacific crest your line is open brendan barnicle thank you i just wanted to followup on kind of the customer  kind of  type of customer you guys are seeing if i look at the average kind of revenue per customer the trend lines there are still growing but at a slower pace than weve seen in the past should we look at that as new customers that youre onboarding are smaller walk us through what youre seeing relative of the type of customer that youre adding in the quarter and what type of trends youre seeing there i would assume with higher multiproduct that has you could start to see that grow and maybe start accelerate but walk or what youre seeing on the type of customers youre on boarding here and then uptake of multiple products mikkel svane thanks brendanill start would be answered here and then well get some additional comments but when you look at our customer count it really is something that we need to continue to grow but were looking at the value of those customers more than just the count of customers so its quality versus quantity from a customer comp perspective if you were to kind of look we do have a seasonal pattern where in the first quarter we have a lot more customer count generated from the smb space and as we go through the year the customer will tilt toward more enterprise type or larger organizations so that definitely plays a role there is a big focus internally in  to have our existing customers existing customers adopt additional products well talk a little bit more about that specifically at our analyst day next week or i guess its in week and half and so but that is a large focus bryans team this year is to make sure that we educate our customers on all of our products that are becoming available to them brendan barnicle helpful thanks operator your next question comes from the line of samad samani from stevens your line is open samad samani hi there thanks for taking my questions first maybe just one on guidance if you think about for q the implied midpoint is just below  yearoveryear and for the year its fairly close as well and then when think about your  target effectively requires you to stay around this growth level pretty consistently for the next few years how should we get comfortable around that given the detail that weve seen and then i have a followup elena gomez yeah i think a couple things we think about that a lot and i think that the key is as we move up market or our business is starting to show more signs of seasonality that you see with enterprise like buyers so thats one thing to think about within the context of the year i also think that as we build out more products in our multiply product goal that will be a key lever to our growth to  which we have not really had a history of so far samad samani gotcha and then i guess maybe if i could ask what type of visibility do you have into guidance and thats my last question thank you elena gomez the way we approach guidance is really looking at the transactional business as far as which is highly predictable and we place a high probability around that and in terms of sort of the larger installs given theres more tolls to cross to get those deals over the finish line we place a lower probability overtime you know and well get more history with that and be more precise but at the moment thats how we approach guidance samad samani great appreciated taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of derrick wood from cowen and company your line is open derrick wood great thanks so you guys are scaling customers very healthy clip you guys support a lot of api calls into the platform that requires a lot of cloud infrastructure and i know when tom came a year ago one of the things he was going to work on was building up availability and security on the infrastructure just wondering kind of where you guys stand today on that and i think there were some kind of uptime challenges last year and maybe ongoing but are you feeling like thats mostly behind you just trying to get a sense for where you are on that effort mikkel svane when i think uptime unable abilities never behind you like we are in a transition moving to cloud infrastructure from our own data centers and we have definitely accelerated some of these projects to really take benefit and take advantage of the some of the advantages that we can find in the cloud infrastructure because we are incredibly mature today so definitely matured and definitely accelerated that part of the process and we believe thats one of the things we really owe to our customers is to provide them with an excellent environment that they can depend on and then some of the challenges that weve had is basically over some of last year like its  like its not good enough and we didnt live up to our own promise to our customers and we have accelerated some investments and some of our products to make sure that we will do whats best for our customers and provide them with best of class infrastructure and reliability elena gomez i would just add that in the shareholder letter we talked a little bit about gross margin and the fact that this investment in the year where we have both a colos strategy and moving to and aws that that will put some tax on our gross margin but as mikkel said its the right thing to do in particular as we move up market so just stay tuned for that mikkel svane yeah so the bottom line on gross margin is we dont normally guide to gross margin but in  gross margin will continue to have a slight penalty as a result of the hybrid investment thats occurring and once were through that transition well see gross margin improve derrick wood great and with the acquisition of outbound and combined that with connect are you going to go after a different type of user more of a marketing person or is the idea to turn a customer service agent more into a marketer mikkel svane well i think what is already happening is that were talking to more and more different buyers in our customer base because i really supporting the customer experience is not just the responsibility of this department of that department its really a responsibility across the organization so we already in the process of talking to more buyers and then the connect product with outbound is definitely also outside of the kind of a call traditional customer service buyer so that will continue to push us in that direction but i think more interesting is that what we see with kind of a new generation of businesses and also new kind of innovative groups within some of the larger enterprises but if think very differently about this and they think of how to nurture the customer experience and really nurturing the customer lifetime happen through a different momentum and a different way of doing business than think about your traditional sales marketing and customer service operating mode so these are really the new type of customers we are gathering for and we see a tremendous amount of growth in that market derrick wood great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of phil winslow from wells fargo your line is open phil winslow hi guys thanks guys for taking my questions just a couple questions first one back on the velocity business earlier you mentioned an uptick that saw towards the end of the quarter thats something i know that youd see seasonally and then we think about just had transactional business over the course of the quarter versus the trends that youd seen over the past few any changes there than just one quick followup for mikkel elena gomez i think im to be honest i think that has a lot to do with some of the focus that bryan has brought in on the operational side of the business he is just making it easier for our sales reps to focus on time with the customer and selling so i think thats starting to pay off so thats good news because we expect to see that to continue phil winslow got it and then mikkel as far as the new products obviously youve commented on connect plus outbound but we look at it to explore for example et cetera how should we expect these to roll out and then sort of how do you think about just your expectations for uptick of some of these new services within the base mikkel svane well we havent we announced  we havent announced a general availability date for the new connect products yet but we will doing this year and you will hear more about explorer later this year we are excited to get these products out we are excited it changes our conversation with customers it helps us having some more broader conversation and we can already see how you know that how people are think about this and brand goes beyond just talking about customer traditional customer support so its exciting like from a bookings revenue perspective this year we have its a lot about the additional products is chad and talk for us to really sell this year chad is doing really well target still in its early innings but like with tremendous amount of momentum really becoming the preferred solution for our own customers so bookings wise revenue impact wise these are really the product for this year that were focusing on phil winslow got it make us operator your next question comes from the line of tom roderick from stifel your line is open tom roderick hi guys thanks for taking my question i want to talk a little bit about your support and interacting here with the aws connect product and youve got  youve certainly got some experience now under your belt with that can you guys really talk a little bit about just how what integration has gone how feedback its coming from my customers anything you can say about that that certainly an interesting partnership there thanks mikkel svane so we spent time with the team at aws connect prior to its launch they will be one of you know the  plus cti vendors we integrate with whats interesting is aws connect comes at a time when weve also seen you know some of the traditional on prim players having more financial difficulties so it is very probable from my perspective that you know it could allow for some more acceptance of sas in the traditional call center world thats normally been on prim oriented too early to tell you know how quickly that kind of trend plays out but i would think that aws connect is a good product that could propelled some of that momentum forward we view all of those products as extremely important as part of our partner programming within the top category but we will also continue do have our own talk solution some customers want to have that one vendor approach tom roderick got it good helpful and last question from me just thinking about the international revenue still sticking right around  of revenues as you look at some of the or more recent offices youve opened up whether its apac or france or investment youve been making over in international regions any particular international territories youd point out having some extra momentum of places that youre  that youd like to put additional resources to accelerate things mikkel svane well we generally open up new countries within geographies and so last year within asiapac we spent time opening up and investing a little bit more in india and japan and seeing some very good early returns off a small base in both of those countries weve done really well in brazil while brazils been having a tough economy over the last two three years that team is now expanding into the spanish speaking countries within latin and so mexico is kind of on their target list in their seeing good reception there and then in europe you know we have a very strong presence in northern europe less so in southern europe and theres a huge opportunity for that vendors team to be more visible in france and other southern european countries so thats kind of the effort youll see from us in  in europe tom roderick thats great color thank you mikkel mikkel svane sure operator your next question comes from the line of kash rangan from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open kash rangan hey guys thanks for taking my question i just had a question on the long term financial goals for  billion dollars in revenue that would imply that from fiscal  updated guidance of the company its a grow lot of   type cagr its more or less in line with what we experienced in q as the numbers get larger how comfortable do you feel that you can hold these growth rates and also secondly curious how youre thinking about field sales capacity growth rate for this year thats it from me thank you elena gomez so i would comment you know kash we definitely look at the long term growth and understand the cagr and really the key is were early in our multiproduct strategy and we believe we had  have a set of solutions for our customers will serve them in their transformation so we think that as we look at multiproduct adoption and continue to focus our land and expand strategy were setting ourselves up for sustaining back room so thats how we think about you had a second question mikkel svane about the sales i mean cover that… elena gomez all the fields yeah go ahead mikkel svane so bryan has really been working to as you know restructure which is pretty much behind us but part of that restructure activity was to put strategic sales reps account reps in market and so for the first time we have account executives who will be closer to our customers and potential customers and were already seeing a benefit to that activity so first time more that gives been out in especially north america in region with the representation and so thats up to an early start and hes ramping up those individuals right now operator your next question comes from the line of jonathan kees from summit redstone your line is open jonathan kees great thanks for taking my question guys and i just had a couple of questions here as you get more into the larger customers and also even with unit requirements are you seeing a lot of dual sourcing taking place especially with the larger customers i would think that there would invite multiple people in for the rfps thats the first question mikkel svane well so generally customer will kind of rely on a few vendors for different types of application that theyre trying to serve we oftentimes through as our land and expand model try to short circuit the normal traditional rfp process but we do also compete often in the rfp process when we compete in the rfp process our winning power is around total cost of ownership time the first ticket the flexibility of our product the future jodi out of our products so you know those are the things that we put forward to gain you know standing in those rfp proposals and those are the fee type sales actions jonathan kees okay so in those rfp situations in and i guess you would encounter i would assume more the bigger players who also offer solution as one part of their packages of software offerings are you seeing more pressure from the big guys are you also seeing pressure from the smaller guys at the bottom end with more the transactional business just curious in terms of competitive picture elena gomez our competitive picture hasnt really changed frankly in and leases i have been here we continue to see obviously service cloud on the high end and we continue to have a fragmented market on the low end so were not  were not really seeing anything emerge as giving us cause for concern to change our strategy jonathan kees okay great thats helpful thanks a lot guys good mikkel svane thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jeff van rhee from craig hallum your line is open jeff van rhee great thanks a couple from me maybe first understanding the limitations of our billings number maybe you could comment if you met your own bookings expectation and then second on outbound can you give us some sense of size revenue headcount they have live customers a little better sense of how mature the product was in the company itself mikkel svane we do not comment on bookings but from a calculated billings perspective two things ill remind everyone only about approximately  of our revenues are invoiced annually the rest is invoiced quarterly and monthly and qis the transactional quarter so theres a lot of debt activity in q as far as out bound they have customer base we had some overlapping customers thats where we kind of discovered that we were taking some parallel pass and we could take up  take what theyve done and what weve done from our connect program and create something that is bigger better but also one we thought we can monetize sooner than just pursuing connect on its own so were really pleased to have that connect team or the out bound team join our connect team to make this a very nice solution for the customer experience jeff van rhee and any semblance of their size that you can share mikkel svane yeah generally there were small company that was generating revenues and developed a really nice product and we will upscale that for zendesk to go after our larger customers with it but thats all i want to say jeff van rhee okay thanks mikkel svane it is not a material transaction for us operator your next question comes from the line of ian strgar from ubs your line is open ian strgar hey guys thanks for taking my question we noticed that during the quarter there were some outages that were posted to your site im wondering if you guys could just give us a little more color on one whether that impacted your ability to meet sla agreements and to just kind of how your whole infrastructure strategy it is looking going into the rest of  mikkel svane yes i just want to start a high level and what i said previously like weve had some outages and we didnt live up to our own expectations specifically weve had some capacity issues that we have remedied a fixed and we have accelerated as we said on move to cloud infrastructure so we can have a more elastic environment which that benefits our growth rates which is one of the issues on our infrastructure so definitely we weve seen some outages that got that going to amplified by some of our capacity issues we have accelerated our move to kind of structure because that projects involved in that and setting ourselves a better op for the rest of the year and to live up to the full promise of our customers as far as bridges elena elena gomez no we havent add anything outside any financial impact and dont expect that this time ian strgar okay great and mikkel its been about a year now since you brought on brian cox to lead enterprise sales initiative im wondering if you can just comment on now that you have  months in your rearview mirror can you just kind of comment on how he has performs and the progress he has made relative to your initial expectation mikkel svane so its been almost exactly of a year since both elena tom and brian joined us and its been a fantastic years its been great its been  no but its like any new few new executive to your management team is traditionally complicated but likely weve been incredibly successful with both the dynamic and the result that we are creating as a team so im very excited about that with brian specifically like brian comes with a ton of professional jobs and operational jobs and has really helped us scale and set the organization up for future success and i am really excited about that this is his job as a chief revenue officer is really to ensure both of current execution and said while sending ourselves out for the future and its a lot of work which he will also tell you if you come to analyst day but like it its going really well and im  i couldnt be more excited about adding such great talent in both elena tom and brian to my team here ian strgar okay great and if i could squeeze one more in the connect product could you just give us any more color on that particular the connect product and how the early customer reception has been and if theres just been any kind of interesting conversations or used cases with that particular product that kind of spans outside of core customer service mikkel svane weve learned tremendously from the connect product and from the early access program that weve had and i think running into outbound with a bunch of our customers has also informed us about the right direction for that product so excited to have the outbound team join us and its been really interesting to see what some of our customers are doing we have one of them coming to analyst days who can talk a little bit more about there some of their experiences so if you can join us for that you can get some firsthand information there ian strgar i will be there thanks a lot guys mikkel svane perfect operator your next question comes from the line of pat walravens from jmp securities your line is open unidentified analyst hi this is mass spencer ph on for pat thank you for taking my question if you wouldnt mind could you just tell me what kind of trends youre seeing with in app support and maybe talk a little bit about the work youre doing with fabric and zendesk kit thank you mikkel svane yes so like with so many of the things were doing mobile is growing rapidly i think we mentioned at the last earnings call that just the amount of chat traffic we see going from web to mobile over the last over june  that was quite dramatic a shift and we continue to see that in kind of throughout powering the customer experience that more more things are happening not just on mobile web but in apps also so by supporting the fabric framework the google fabric framework we are really making these things incredibly easy for developers and like with a few clicks you can get the full kind of support customer service experience in to your app and really provided as a seamless interaction in our app so very excited about working with google fabric framework very exciting to work with many many developments who are building these capabilities into their apps and thats no doubt that its a different paradigm providing these things on mobile but like we have a big team working on it and im really excited about what were seeing there unidentified analyst thats great thank you very much mikkel svane thank you operator your next question comes from the line of alex zukin from piper jaffray your line is open unidentified analyst yeah hey guys this is scott on for alex just a couple quick ones for me you call that kind of q as the volume base quarter enterprise more since really back half weighted im curious if there are any kind of strategic programs or initiatives that theyve launched to help feed those sale cycles to this up sale cycle weve hear anecdotally you might be testing out then kind of strategy consulting teams in a limited number of geographies curious if thats true and if we could get any more color on that mikkel svane i think what youre referring to is our motions around solutions consulting and success and those kind of activities in professional services and as we move and evolve up market those kind of activities tend to be more valued and so thats probably what youre observing is that marketplace is that some of our customers are getting into more complex use cases theyre getting into a broader implementations zendesk and they look to our teams to help them that is part of our future strategy is to not only build our own teams to support that but over time to kind of describe to our customers the availability of a broader external set of development systems integrators that can help out you hear more about that next week at our investor day but that is part of our kind of evolving strategy addressing these larger opportunities unidentified analyst got it understood i look forward to hear more about that and then unrelated were hearing kind of on again off again plans to pursue federal apps certification curious that if its back on and thats true what youre seeing in the federal vertical right now mikkel svane so there are a lot of things happening in fed ramp and there are some alternatives in the fed rampup process and were evaluating those alternative avenues for fed ramp fed ramp is endower is somewhat long and cumbersome and so there are other ways that we can do business with the fed as you know were already doing business at the fcc and other places within pockets of those different government entities but it is an area that we will focus on over time unidentified analyst got it thanks guys operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of nate cunningham from guggenheim your line is open nate cunningham hi guys thanks for taking my question i was wondering if you could give us a sense where the enterprise renewal rates have been trending relative to those in the velocity business elena gomez we dont really disclose segment details but i think i said earlier our turning contraction has remained steady since our ipo days nate cunningham okay thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to the presenters mikkel svane thanks rob we appreciate you turning into our earnings call today i want to remind everybody that our analyst day is a week from monday in our headquarters here in san francisco and again there will be a webcast as well as an opportunity to come in live and were looking

collapse when zendesk ceo mikkel svane first came up with the idea of zendesk a customer service software that’s now worth  billion everyone thought it was boring  but when he shared the vision for his product — a webbased ondemand platform where companies can build relationships with customers — his boring idea suddenly became sexy  he shares his thinking behind his idea in his recent book “startupland” he writes “sexy stuff sometimes happens when you make mundane things easy and accessible any aspect of democratization is a good thing” for example he says the old ftp file sharing platform doesn’t sound all that fun but dropbox and box made filesharing sexy with better features and design retail credit card payment isn’t all that exciting but square made it cool too because of amazon’s jeff bezos the boring idea of taking bookstores online turned into a massive overhaul of the world of commerce he says svane also shares some of his trade secrets from working in the customer support field here are three of the “most unlikely tricks” he learned make it personal and mistakes are ok emails that were perfectly crafted didn’t generate much response he says instead when spelling errors or simple sentences were used people would respond more often “people realized it wasn’t an automated email but a message from a real person — and they responded to that” women get more responses when early employee michael hansen used his male name he didn’t get a lot of responses but once he changed his name to josephine the response rate shot up it might be because most it people are male but for some reason female names work better it’s all about the conversation it doesn’t really matter what you talk about but just having a real conversation helps in terms of response rates “we could quickly see a direct correlation between response rates to our emails and conversions to customers” he writes  more zendesk mikkel svane facebook linkedin twitter email print ×

matthew hi this is matthew wise with founderly we empower entrepreneurs to have a voice and share their story with the world enabling others to learn about building products and starting companies so it’s with great pleasure that i am here today with mikkel svane who is the founder of zendesk zendesk is a cloud based customer service platform mikkel we’d love for you to give our audience a brief bio mikkel yes first of all i’m danish thus the broken english here i moved to california with my family two years ago basically i moved my company over here and then my family moved along zendesk is my first startup at this stage but i’ve always been working with my own companies i’ve always been working with technology always been working with internet technologies basically since my first visit to san francisco which was back in ’ thus ’ was the year when we started to have dialup connections and so on in europe and i flew into san francisco drove up to san francisco through the  and there’s all these billboards and they all have web addresses on them and i was like “what the hell is going on here” it was superinteresting something that defined a lot of my career path but i’m danish i have a couple of kids live on out in bernal heights grew up in copenhagen matthew can you tell us what makes zendesk unique who is it for and why are you so passionate about it mikkel yes we built zendesk i have two cofounders for my company and we built zendesk because we had experience from working with these kind of systems we implemented these kind of systems for companies and enterprises of all sizes and both from the business side and from the technology side and these systems were just painful to work with it felt like it was a space that it was an industry that flew under the radar there was a bunch of startups working with social this and mobile this and productivity and how to work smarter and better and all kinds of stuff but nobody really wanted to deal with the customer support help desk space i think a lot of it had to do with the fact that back then all traditional customer support help desk was very much for the bottom feeders if you couldn’t figure out how to be an engineer you ended up in the help desk if you couldn’t figure out being a sales person you ended up in the customer service department it wasn’t a very sexy industry you didn’t pick up a lot of girls saying you work with help desks so it seemed like nobody really tried to reach or take that industry uptodate so we thought it was painful products to work with back then and we got together and said “we can do this product let’s figure out building a product that is both beautiful simple intuitive and all of that stuff and make it uptodate so that it works with internet technologies and you can subscribe to it as a service and so on” as with startups there’s many ways to tell the founding story but this is one of them at least matthew what are some of the technology and market trends that currently exist and where do you see things developing in the future for your space mikkel we were in many ways a first mover in kind of rethinking the customer service space the customer service platforms out there and i think we’ve been blessed and we’ve been very very lucky that since we launched our product it has become very very obvious for companies that they need to take the customer service much more seriously it’s very hard today because of the internet because of social media and all that stuff it’s very hard today to conceal or to hide a bad customer service experience if somebody has a bad experience with something it’s out there so you not only for some companies they say “well we can’t satisfy everybody so there are some of our customers they get a bad customer service experience and that’s too bad we’ll lose them” but nobody can really say that anymore because if somebody gets a bad customer service experience they’ll tell everybody about it and it will be super public it will be out there and their friends will know about it and they will inspire others to look for other products too since we launched our product a lot of companies have realized they need to take their customer service and their technical support much more seriously basically they have to address some of the very basic contract items in dealing with your customers or dealing with people in your own life they need to be responsive they need to be open and transparent about what’s going on and they need to be authentic you can’t just lie yourself out of stuff you have to address things with a real tone that is basically what we at help companies are doing and to what extent it has really helped and transformed our business matthew what inspired you to start zendesk how did you come across an idea and discover the opportunity mikkel as i said before we worked with these kind of systems we found that it was painful to work with them the implementation processes were typically year long it became very complicated systems that were very complicated for the actual users the customer support people that supported this use i think most importantly all these systems were so complicated so filled with metrics and management and administration that nobody really had the ability to focus on the customer service experience it was kind of like the customer got buried in all these big complicated systems so we basically said “let’s turn this upside down build a system that is beautifully simple to use that you can hit the ground running with the system you don’t have to think about training administration or anything like that it’s not something that you have to install on your own server you don’t need to think about how does this integrate with my email server or how does it integrate with my website and take care of all of that stuff and just allows you to not focus on the clutter and focus on your customers” in many ways that was what at least one of the stories that defines the startup of our company matthew who are your cofounders how did you meet what qualities were you looking for and how did you know that they would be a good fit mikkel first of all they are really good friends i think that everybody knows that the first period of a startup prefunding and all that stuff is a bitch there are so many things that can go wrong so you need to have a good contract a good relationship with the people that surround you one of the dilemmas with building a startup prefunding is you have to go through a phase of bootstrapping there’s no money in it it’s a little hard for everybody and if you are out together with really good people they all get all these offers for “why don’t you get a job here or why don’t you participate in inaudible  we are funded it’s a completely different game” and you have to manage yourself and your cofounders through that process and that’s just painful i’ve known both my two cofounders for many years i’ve been working with them in different companies and we were all working as consultants back then and we all agreed that if we wanted to get back to what we were really passionate about and that was building products building great products this was our last chance if we didn’t do it now we would never get to do it i have two cofounders we are three cofounders in total morten we’re all danish morten and alexander morten primdahl and alexander aghassipour you have to spell that we are all three with the company still and alex is our product mother and morten is our chief itech and still responsible for most of the infrastructure matthew from idea to product launch how long did it take and when did you actually launch zendesk mikkel i think we worked with the idea for quite a while and i think we spent almost a year trying to build the product getting ideas about what was the optimal work flow what were the best practices that we try to built big into the product without making them stand in your face so i think that took a year building a working version of the product and being able to launch that that was one of the things we really wanted to do we wanted to go out and have a fully functional product that you could start with on day one that was a little bit over  years ago that was october st  that we launched the product into the wild and it was a fully functional product and we started having customers already the first month matthew are there any unique metrics or social proof about zendesk that you’d like to share with our audience mikkel sure yes i will we came to san francisco two years ago it was a very bootstrap operation until then it was basically the three founders and then we had a couple of people around the world helping us today i think we’re like  people in total  of those people here in san francisco in our new offices in the new midmarket district up in th and market we announced earlier this year that we now have more than  customers that is  businesses around the world using our product for serving their employee’s partners or of course customers we have customers enrolled in  countries today we have a european headquarters in london we have an apac headquarters in melbourne we have an engineering division that we just set up in my home city of copenhagen where we have i think ten employees right now we’re a cost free raised round over here so we have through our series a b and c raised a little over  million and we are doing really really well i remember one of the first times we got to san francisco i visited twitter and these guys there were like  people and all over the place and it was the greatest people to deal with ever and they wanted to use zendesk i remember they were like “yeah we probably have like a couple of hundred requests a day” yeah no problem easy peasy and we helped them and soon after that they got on “oprah” and obama and i don’t know what their popularity just exploded and we got through that transition with them it’s one of these stories where we are a little tiny bit of the twitter story and that’s just superinteresting i also remember the first time the groupon people approached us tiny little company up in chicago we didn’t really knew who they were there was some weird conversation going on we were literally uncertain about it “what are these guys” but we said “yeah let’s make our way to helping them and get them started with some good customer service and so on” right now today they got  agents on zendesk it’s completely crazy and we’ve been with them through this crazy growth they’ve been on it’s really interesting to see these operations from the inside and i can tell the same story of fdb or dropbox or a lot of these other companies that are using zendesk today that’s an amazing part of our story but coming back to what it is that we really want to do here building a beautiful simple product is also that we wanted to marketize this space we want to make everybody capable of providing great customer service so some of the stories that are most kind of fascinating for me is how these little maintenance management company in missouri that needed to bid on a tender and needed to provide a sales service solution for this tender so they set up a zendesk over the weekend made it look crazy good submitted it and won that tender and they’ve been winning every tender since then just because they have a professional grade sweet looking sales service part so these are some of the stories that are great to share   podcast
