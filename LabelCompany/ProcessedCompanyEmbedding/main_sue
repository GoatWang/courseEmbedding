of thousands of injuries every year in the us product liability law the legal rules concerning who is responsible for defective or dangerous products is different from ordinary injury law and this set of rules sometimes makes it easier for an injured person to recover damages product liability refers to a manufacturer or seller being held liable for placing a defective product into the hands of a consumer responsibility for a product defect that causes injury lies with all sellers of the product who are in the distribution chain in general terms the law requires that a product meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer when a product has an unexpected defect or danger the product cannot be said to meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer there is no federal product liability law typically product liability claims are based on state laws and brought under the theories of negligence strict liability or breach of warranty in addition a set of commercial statutes in each state modeled on the uniform commercial code will contain warranty rules affecting product liability responsible parties for product liability to arise at some point the product must have been sold in the marketplace historically a contractual relationship known as privity of contract had to exist between the person injured by a product and the supplier of the product in order for the injured person to recover in most states today however that requirement no longer exists and the injured person does not have to be the purchaser of the product in order to recover any person who foreseeably could have been injured by a defective product can recover for his or her injuries as long as the product was sold to someone liability for a product defect could rest with any party in the products chain of distribution such as the product manufacturer a manufacturer of component parts a party that assembles or installs the product the wholesaler and the retail store that sold the product to the consumer for strict liability to apply the sale of a product must be made in the regular course of the suppliers business thus someone who sells a product at a garage sale would probably not be liable in a product liability action types of product defects under any theory of liability a plaintiff in a product liability case must prove that the product that caused injury was defective and that the defect made the product unreasonably dangerous there are three types of defects that might cause injury and give rise to manufacturer or supplier liability design defects  present in a product from the beginning even before it is manufactured in that something in the design of the product is inherently unsafe manufacturing defects  those that occur in the course of a products manufacture or assembly marketing defects  flaws in the way a product is marketed such as improper labeling insufficient instructions or inadequate safety warnings whos responsible the doctrine known as res ipsa loquitur shifts the burden of proof in some product liability cases to the defendants translated this latin term means the thing speaks for itself and indicates that the defect at issue would not exist unless someone was negligent if the doctrine is successfully invoked the plaintiff is no longer required to prove how the defendant was negligent rather the defendant is required to prove that it was not negligent the second rule that helps plaintiffs in product liability cases is that of strict liability if strict liability applies the plaintiff does not need to prove that a manufacturer was negligent but only that the product was defective by eliminating the issue of manufacturer fault the concept of nofault or strict liability allows plaintiffs to recover where they otherwise might not see proving fault in a product liability case to learn more unavoidably unsafe products by their nature some products simply cannot be made safer without losing their usefulness for example an electric knife that is too dull to injure anyone would also be useless for its intended purpose it is generally believed that as to such products users and consumers are the best equipped to minimize risk thus while a product might not be deemed unreasonably dangerous manufacturers and suppliers of unavoidably unsafe products must give proper warnings of the dangers and risks of their products so that consumers can make informed decisions regarding common defenses to product liability claims a defense often raised in product liability cases is that the plaintiff has not sufficiently identified the supplier of the product that allegedly caused the injury a plaintiff must be able to connect the product with the partyies responsible for manufacturing or supplying it there is an exception to this rule known as the market share liability exception which applies in cases involving defective medications where a plaintiff cannot identify which of the pharmaceutical companies that supply a particular drug supplied the drug heshe took each manufacturer will be held liable according to its percentage of sales in the area where the injury occurred another defense a manufacturer might raise is that the plaintiff substantially altered the product after it left the manufacturers control and this alteration caused the plaintiffs injury a related defense is that the plaintiff misused the product in an unforeseeable way and that hisher misuse of the product cause the injuries alleged get free legal help for a defective product injury today product liability

complications nuvaring side effects and lawsuits side effects of chinese drywall lawsuits and damages cosmetic product injury lawsuits by coulter boeschen share on google plus share on facebook injuries from cosmetic products can come in a wide variety of forms  from allergic reactions to infections and other complications there are two main legal theories that a person injured by a cosmetic product the plaintiff could sue under product liability and breach of warranty this article discusses what a plaintiff in a cosmetic injury suit must prove under either theory cases specifically related to allergic reactions and the possibility of class action lawsuits product liability the basics the most likely theory to be used in a lawsuit involving cosmetic product injuries is product liability an injured plaintiff can sue both the manufacturer andor the seller the defendant of the cosmetic product if his or her injury was caused by a defect a defective design or improper labeling most states follow what is called the “strict product liability” rule although a few still use traditional negligence rules a plaintiff suing under a strict liability theory simply needs to prove that he or she was the kind of consumer that the defendant intended to use the product that the defect did not occur after the product was sold and that the plaintiff was injured this kind of theory is called strict liability because many of the requirements in a standard negligence case like proof of a specific duty of care owed to the plaintiff are not included most states adopted strict liability for massmarketed consumer products because among other things the manufacturers needed to be financially responsible for their products and not be allowed to escape liability simply because of the difficulty plaintiffs faced trying to prove negligence claims in a negligence case in those few states that still use this theory for consumer products the plaintiff will need to prove that he or she bought the product from the defendant that the defendant should have known that the product could be dangerous if unaccompanied by proper warnings or that the product had a defect that the failure to warn the plaintiff or the defect or defective design injured the plaintiff and that the plaintiff didn’t do anything to cause the injury breach of warranty a cosmetic product injury case based on a breach of warranty theory will be the same as other standardbreach of warranty cases an injured plaintiff could sue for breach of an express warranty if the seller or manufacturer made specific guarantees that a product would have specific effects that the product did not have note that this theory might not fit with most cases involving an actual injury the plaintiff could also sue for breach of an implied warranty that the cosmetic product was fit for normal use ie the implied guarantee that no normal cosmetic product would cause an injury if used properly finally the plaintiff could sue for breach of an implied warranty that the product was fit for a specific purpose ie that the defendant knew the plaintiff wanted to use the product for a specific purpose but the product caused an injury when the plaintiff tried use it there are many state and federal laws controlling breach of warranty claims some breach of warranty claims may not be appropriate when the plaintiff is suing for physical injuries if the law only allows compensation for the money lost on the product what is called “economic damages” some warranty laws however do allow a plaintiff to sue for physical injuries perhaps more importantly proving a breach of warranty can help prove a strict liability or negligence claim a plaintiff is not limited to suing under one theory so including a breach of warranty claim in a cosmetic injury lawsuit will generally help a plaintiffs case overall injuries caused by allergies if a manufacturer knows or should know that a product might cause an allergic reaction in some people injured plaintiffs could potentially sue the manufacturer for failing to warn about the allergic reaction under a strict liability or negligence theory a breach of warranty theory might also be possible if the allergic reaction is not extremely rare ie the product was not fit for cosmetic use because some percentage of the population was allergic class actions for cosmetic product injuries if a cosmetic product causes many or all of its users the same kind of injury then a class action may be possible in a class action case multiple plaintiffs with the same kind of injury from the same source sue the defendant in one lawsuit if someone is injured by a cosmetic product they or their attorney should research whether there is already a class action case or a settlement fund for people injured by the product often even though the case has settled there will be a fund to pay those who were not a part of the original case   share on google plus share on

subjected to liability include all consumer goods medical devices commercialpersonal vehicles aircraft and consumable goods such as food and prescription drugs as it is the duty of a product vendor or manufacturer to producesupply a product which will not cause harm during normal use manufacturervendors of unsafe products are subject to recovery for damages contact a product liability lawyer to consult your case theories of recovery  theories of recovery are the principals upon which a customer may seek compensation for injuries or inconveniences resulting from their use of an unsafe product  when seeking recovery the buyer must present cause of action for tort which may be from bodily injury property damage or pain and suffering resulting from the intended use of an unsafe or defective product  three theories of legal recovery under product liability law are recovery under manufacturers defect recovery under insufficientunclear warnings or instructions and recovery under design defect types of losses  product liability losses resulting from defect may net economic loss compensation for the buyer or victim of harm  while physical injuries resulting from contact or use of a defective product usually are filed as negligence tort the pain and suffering incurred in the aftermath of those injuries may also be filed for as intangible economic losses  products with defects also may be held in breach of warranty if normal uses reveals a manufacturing defect or if the product cannot be used to fulfill its intended purpose negligence  liability for physical harm the proof of negligence in tort law requires that the plaintiff assert error or neglect on behalf of the seller to render safe usable products to the market sellers engaged in business of product sale must deliver a functioning product that is not unreasonably dangerous during normal use  product buyers who are harmed physically or suffer property damage from defects may sue for product negligence meaning of dangerously defective or unsafe products in product liability tort a vendor may be liable for prosecution if the product is dangerously defective or unsafe a defective product is defined as a product which is unreasonably dangerous to the user when used for its intended purpose without any interference victims of injury resulting from the use of unsafe products with defects may be entitled to sue as tort for damages  if the product can be proven as defective or unsafe the plaintiff may claim damages from physical injuries property damage and pain and suffering from the like contributory negligence misuse and other intervening misconduct  contributory negligence misuse and intervening misconduct are forms of defense to torts of negligence  when a plaintiff claims product liability in tort the vendor may allege that there was fault on behalf of the buyer which negates the original claim if a defendant successfully raises a contributory negligence misuse or intervening misconduct he or she is not liable for the original tort contributory negligence is negligent behavior on behalf of the plaintiff which contributes or is the cause of the damages claimed in tort misuse is use of the product in question for anything other than its intended purpose  intervening misconduct is any interference by a third party which may be to blame for the damages in tort  proof in product liability tort the burden of proof can vary case by case  this is generally due to the fact that there are many claims and counterclaims available for the plaintiff and defendant of a product liability lawsuit each with their respective burden of proof in such torts the plaintiff is tasked normally tasked with finding fault with the defendants product while the defense is tasked with attributing blame for the injury to the plaintiffs negligence or misuse  generally for every theory of recovery in products liability there is an appropriate standard defense  product liability is a wellrehearsed field of tort and is more tightlyconstructed than other fields of personal injury and tort comments comments no related posts share share   tweet      share   related articles
