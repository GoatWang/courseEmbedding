nongaap measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap rather we believe the ebitda calculation provides additional information to investors and debt holders due to the fact that tax credits tax rates and other tax related items vary by company additionally years of service for fixed assets and amortizable assets are based on company judgment finally companies have several ways of raising capital which can affect interest expense we believe the presentation of ebitda provides a meaningful measure of performance exclusive of these
