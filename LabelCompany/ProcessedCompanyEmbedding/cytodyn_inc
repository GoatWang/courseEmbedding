therapeutics  viralentry inhibitors  that are intended to protect healthy cells from viral infection  pro  is a fully humanized igg monoclonal antibody directed against ccr a molecular portal that hiv uses to enter tcells  pro  blocks the predominant hiv r subtype entry into tcells by masking this required coreceptor ccr  importantly pro  does not appear to interfere with the normal function of ccr in mediating immune responses  pro  has certain unique attributes that distinguish it from other therapies designed to block hiv entry pro  is an antibody not a synthetic drug and has no apparent issues with toxicity laboratory studies have shown that pro  does not induce the development of resistant viruses in previous shortterm trials pro  does not affect the normal function of ccr it only blocks the precise site on ccr that hiv needs to enter the cell without affecting the normal function of ccr pro  is one of the most advanced experimental monoclonal antibodies for hiv treatment and has been used in more than  hivinfected subjects in placebo controlled and open label fdaapproved clinical trials pro  has been the subject of seven clinical trials each demonstrating efficacy by significantly reducing or controlling hiv viral load in human test subjects  pro  has been designated a “fast track” product candidate by the fda  the pro  antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent leading to potentially fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements as compared to daily drug therapies currently in use we believe that pro  may have a number of potential roles in the treatment and prevention of hiv including patients with single or multidrug resistant viruses patients with difficulty adhering to daily drug regimens patients who poorly tolerate existing therapies patients with compromised organ function ie hcv coinfection patients with complex concomitant medical requirements preexposure prep or postexposure pep prophylactic in high risk seronegative individuals hiv remains a significant global health issue with limited new drugs in development around the world cytodyn believes that monoclonal antibodies are poised to become the next class of antiviral agents on the market for the treatment of hiv cytodyn is focused on developing monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of hiv infection and disease and is excited to continue the clinical
