as we should so orbis wants to take a lot of that error out of the hands of the patient and put it back into the dosage form we use precision particle fabrication to create particles that are very uniform and unique things if you want to inject a particle theres a certain optimal size if you want to control the release rate for weeks or days theres a certain optimal size so on the left you can see an example of orbis technology on the right you can see particles made from the exact same material from a different manufacturing process all the particles are different sizes theres no sort of uniformity you can deal with that later you can sieve off some of the particles and try to find the right ones but orbis can actually do that from the very beginning for kids taste is one of the biggest problems so we use this technology to mask the taste so that you dont taste anything we recently produced a four to five kilogram batch and we have the capacity to create scales that are large enough to address clinical trial need right now pharmaceutical companies can leverage this technology to differentiate their products maybe they need to make it long acting or theres a taste issue or they need a new format this allows them to introduce differentiated products into their portfolio these are the things you cant do with other technologies delivering precision orbis biosciences

call us   orb return to pipeline therapeutic area indication phase partner platform oncology orb cancer   cnspain orb acute pain   about taste masking and dosage format flexibility there is a significant demand for tastemasked pharmaceutical formulations due to a large number of geriatric and pediatric patients who lack access to ageappropriate dosage formats upwards of  of children discharged from pediatric hospitals are prescribed one or more medications that are designed approved and intended for use in adults underscoring the need for patientspecific formulations the importance of providing safe effective and proven medicines for children has been continually cited as an area in need of improvement for pharmaceutical companies and the providers who administer their products however the widespread lack of patientspecific drug products forces medical providers and pharmacists to use alternative solutions to treat their pediatric and geriatric patients that are not backed by key bioavailability stability and safety studies not only are these methods inconsistent they often lead to dosing errors decreased bioavailability or efficacy and they suffer from nonadherence because of foultasting pharmaceutical actives the lack of titratable and palatable formulations affects  percent of the global population subjecting patients to avoidable adverse drug events reduced compliance with medication regimens limited access to new medications and prolonged treatable illnesses current dosing regimens for pediatric and geriatric populations suffer because they fail to address the following critical aspects simultaneously palatability many apis are extremely bitter and coating efforts can result in an unpleasant mouth feel due to irregular surface features approximately half of children refuse to take their medicine with the large majority of those reporting bad taste as the single major reason for noncompliance sweeteners alone are often unable to overcome the extremely unpleasant taste of many active ingredients moreover efforts to mask flavors using coatings agglomeration or microencapsulation often result in poorly controlled heterogeneous particle distributions that result in a gritty or granular mouth feel titratable dosing different ages weights and body mass indices require extreme dosing precision that is not linearly scaled medication errors are common in  percent of pediatric hospitalizations dose titration is critical onesizefitsall dosing is ineffective in children due to their developmental variability drug format a wide variety of age appropriate formats liquid suspensions chewable tablets effervescent tablets are needed up to onethird of children have difficulty swallowing tablets in the absence of patientspecific dosages – formulations that are both palatable to ensure compliance and titratable to meet the weightsurface areaappropriate dosage needs from neonates to adolescents – healthcare providers either i prescribe adultapproved liquid formulations or ii manipulate available products to create extemporaneous formulations eg by crushing a tablet liquid suspensions while titratable and largely preferred by children over tablets and capsules are often poorly palatable and thus suffer from poor compliance extemporaneous formulations can alter the performance – including the palatability and bioavailability – of the original product and contribute to both poor compliance only  compliance in hospitals and increased risk for under and overdosing freeflowing drugloaded

of americans affected by debilitating diseases of the inner ear including sudden sensorineural hearing loss autoimmune inner ear disease tinnitus and meniere’s disease there are no fdaapproved drugs to treat these diseases forcing physicians to administer – both systemically and locally – offlabel ad hoc formulations of drugs that lack evidencebased safety and efficacy data current approaches to local delivery of therapeutics to the inner ear offer either high control of dose levels or low administration costs  but not both this significantly limits their commercial viability and the potential to improve patients’ lives as the market demands drugs that are safe efficacious and costeffective there are two approaches to deliver steroids that are used in current clinical practice i oral and ii intratympanic injection orallydelivered steroids offer patients convenience and low cost physicians working within the confines of current medical reimbursement paradigms often use oral steroids as a first line treatment for common otic disorders in order for a physician to be reimbursed for intratympanic steroid use current procedural terminology code  a patient must often have a documented inability to tolerate oral steroids or have at least  week of hearing loss with no improvement after oral steroid therapy oral steroids are typically dosed at high levels mg per day for up to  days followed by  day taper to achieve significant concentration of the drug within the perilymph fluid of the cochlea oral steroid treatment has shown some level of effectiveness in the treatment of steroidresponsive disorders however treatment is generally limited to short durations  weeks due to the significant negative sideeffects of systemic steroids it is also unclear if and to what extent systemic steroid treatment results in sufficient concentrations of steroid in the inner ear systemic steroid exposure can cause significant sideeffects and is thus a less preferred option than local delivery to the cochlea compared to systemic delivery intratympanic delivery of steroid to the inner ear offers the ability to deliver high concentrations of steroids to the inner ear for longer periods of time the rationale for intratympanic injections is that they might allow for higher concentrations and longer durations of drug exposure within the inner ear and could therefore result in improved clinical outcomes current clinical practices rely on ad hoc formulations of steroids that have produced inconsistent clinical results for example a placebocontrolled study of the intratympanic dexamethasone  mgml for the treatment of meniere’s disease reported substantial improvement of vertigo symptoms  versus  placebo control however a similar randomized doubleblind study showed intratympanic dexamethasone did not improve symptoms compared to placebo saline and sodium hyaluronate these inconsistent clinical outcomes could be attributable to the pharmacokinetics of the steroid within the inner ear indeed increasing the dose from  mgml to  mgml can improve the control of symptoms in meniere’s disease this year longitudinal study showed that sustained levels of steroid in the perilymph could significantly improve outcomes for patients as  of patients reported “acceptable” vertigo control after  to  injections of mgml dexamethasone a  study in which the intratympanic injection dose was increased to mgml of dexamethasone resulted in patients reporting  control of vertigo symptoms taken together there is clinical evidence to support the hypothesis that increased concentrations of steroids in the inner ear can improve treatment outcomes based upon this clinical data we developed orb in order to demonstrate that providing steadystate steroid levels in the perilymph cochlea fluid for no less than  days will overcome these challenges and provide significant clinical benefits about orb as the first therapeutic to use unisun™ orb will eliminate the need for physicians to prescribe offlabel use of high concentrations of oral steroids or ad hoc formulations of suspended steroids that they deliver through intratympanic injection while both systemic via oral dosages and local via intratympanic injection delivery of steroids to the inner ear have been a common practice in the ear nose and throat medical community for some time there has yet to be definitive clinicalbased evidence as to the utility of this approach to improve patient outcomes regardless of the route of administration offlabel use of steroids is problematic for a number of reasons including lack of both clinical and scientificbased understanding of the appropriate steroid concentrations to achieve a therapeutic effect in the inner ear insufficient pharmacokinetic data to determine the appropriate dose leaving patients at risk for both under and over dose lack of safety data leaving patients exposed to unnecessary risks that could potentially worsen their hearing minimal clarity on the appropriate treatment duration which further contributes to the potential risks orbis has developed orb to deliver therapeutic concentrations of steroids to the inner ear for more than  weeks after a single intratympanic injection this represents a significant improvement over current clinical practices that rely on multiple intratympanic injections spaced several days apart for the treatment of otic disorders that are steroidresponsive an example of this common procedure performed by dr chris chang of the fauquier ear nose and throat consultants of virginia can be viewed online notice that the patient must lay their head to the side for approximately  minutes to allow for the steroid to diffuse through the round window membrane rwm as soon as the patient sits up right or swallows the steroid solution will run down the estuation tube and be ingested an undesirable effect that limits the amount of time that the drug is in contact with the rwm in contrast orb will adhere steroidloaded microspheres to the rwm in less time  minutes after injection and will remain for a minimum of  weeks thereby allowing for controlled release of steroid to the inner ear for prolonged periods of time from a single convenient intratympanic injection references matsuoka a j  harris j p autoimmune inner ear disease a retrospective review of fortyseven patients audiology

fabricationplatformsunprecedented controlunparalleled scalabilityfaqsrd pipelineblogfor funcontact us medication nonadherence is a big problem its a  billion dollar problem in the us annually fifty percent of us dont take medications as we should so orbis wants to take a lot of that error out of the hands of the patient and put it back into the dosage form we use precision particle fabrication to create particles that are very uniform and unique things if you want to inject a particle theres a certain optimal size if you want to control the release rate for weeks or days theres a certain optimal size so on the left you can see an example of orbis technology on the right you can see particles made from the exact same material from a different manufacturing process all the particles are different sizes theres no sort of uniformity you can deal with that later you can sieve off some of the particles and try to find the right ones but orbis can actually do that from the very beginning for kids taste is one of the biggest problems so we use this technology to mask the taste so that you dont taste anything we recently produced a four to five kilogram batch and we have the capacity to create scales that are large enough to address clinical trial need right now pharmaceutical companies can leverage this technology to differentiate their products maybe they need to make it long acting or theres a taste issue or they need a new format this allows them to introduce differentiated products into their portfolio these are the things you cant do with other technologies delivering precision orbis biosciences optimizes oral and injectable pharmaceutical products for improved compliance our proprietary technologies provide customized drug release format and dose flexibility and
