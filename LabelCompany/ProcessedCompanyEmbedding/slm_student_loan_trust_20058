filed as shortterm assets in its cash flow analysis given that fitchs current criteria is silent on the treatment of such assets this treatment is considered a criteria variation under the counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated july   fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest in are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the notes fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities since the ffelp student loan abs relies on the us government to reimburse defaults aaasf ffelp abs ratings will likely move in tandem with the aaa us sovereign rating aside from the us sovereign rating defaults basis risk and loan extension risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in ffelp student loan transactions additional defaults basis shock beyond fitchs published stresses lower than expected payment speed and other factors could result in future downgrades likewise a buildup of ce driven by positive excess spread given
