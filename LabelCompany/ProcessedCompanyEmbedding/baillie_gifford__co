nominate a small local charity as its charity of the year nominations are only accepted for small charities where baillie giffords support will make a real impact on the services they provide a shortlist is produced and staff then vote for the charity they would like the firm to support the chosen charity for  was contact the elderly a local charity dedicated to tackling loneliness and isolation among older people the backbone of contact the elderly is its volunteers who host the tea parties and drive the elderly to and from each event this includes a number of staff from baillie gifford some of whom spoke about their experience of volunteering for the charity you can tell that these parties mean so much to the guests and it’s something they clearly look forward to hannah dobson – compliance analyst “i was really nervous when i picked up my guests for the first time but i had no need to be we had lots to chat about and there was so much laughter – it was like we had known each other for years “it’s fantastic to see the older guests connect with each other in fact two of the ladies i pick up went to school together and hadn’t seen each other for around  years until they attended the same tea party they still recognised each other after all that time and they instantly connected over past friendship “you can tell that these parties mean so much to the guests and it’s something they clearly look forward to” tracey squires – compliance policies and training coordinator “i have wanted to volunteer for a long time but i struggled to find something that wasn’t too time intensive since the contact the elderly tea parties only take place once a month it’s perfect for me as it’s not too much of a time commitment “the older people love telling us stories from their youth and last week when i was in the car with one of the guests we drove past the church where she got married in  it’s a real honour to be in the company of people who have done so much in their lives “we are all going to get older and it’s nice to know that contact the elderly is there looking out for us and our loved ones i think that’s why the charity resonates with so many people” jessie wilson – client service manager “i’ve only recently become a driver for contact the elderly lack of free time previously held me back from volunteering but being a driver for the charity only involves a few hours once a month “it’s been amazing to see the elderly guests get out of the house and be in the company of a group of people enjoying some conversation “i find volunteering for contact the elderly very enjoyable so it doesn’t feel like i’m going out of my way to help people it has given me the opportunity to meet some lovely people who have great life stories all while i get to enjoy eating some cake too” máirín eydmann – project manager “i was part of the baillie gifford habitat for humanity team last year which was a great experience i really enjoyed going to ethiopia and working with the local community the experience made me want to seek out an opportunity to work with my local community in edinburgh “when i heard that contact the elderly was looking for volunteers it seemed like a good fit for me i’m a keen baker so hosting tea parties meant that i could combine my enthusiasm for baking with volunteering “i also enjoy socialising with our elderly neighbours so extending that to tea party guests was the natural thing for me to do and volunteering for contact the elderly is no hardship i get to have great conversations with the group and eat cake it’s a fantastic way to spend a sunday afternoon” dorothy green – receptionist “i had been thinking about volunteering for a while so when contact the elderly became our charity of the year it seemed like the ideal opportunity “i’m so glad i got involved with the charity i am now the driver of a lovely yearold lady and together we go along to a tea party hosted by a baillie gifford volunteer one sunday each month “there are six older ladies in the group along with six baillie gifford drivers plus the host and we spend two hours chatting over cups of tea and delicious cakes the whole process is very rewarding and above all enjoyable i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who might be considering volunteering” sarah mitchell – investment assistant “i was keen to get involved in some charity work in my local area when i heard about contact the elderly through baillie gifford “i’m a volunteer driver for a lovely lady who is  years old she had a great time at the tea party which got her out of the house and gave her the chance to meet new people i also really enjoyed chatting to her and hearing more about her life “my first tea party was great – it’s nice to spend an afternoon listening to the group’s stories i’m already looking forward to my next tea party” corporate citizenship read more about our other sponsorship

search  about us type your search here our story  about us  baillie gifford our story culture in a nutshell baillie gifford has fostered a culture based on partnership rigorous research methods and an investment philosophy that focuses on growth over the long term from our edinburgh base we have been able to harness this intellectually curious yet rigorous approach – where the sharing of ideas and robust debate between our investment teams is central to our investment process the result is a successful business that continues to grow organically we now have £ billion under management and advice in specialist equity fixed income and multiasset portfolios for a global client base focus on clients we would be nothing without our clients that may seem obvious but can easily be overlooked all too often the financial sector will chase new business to the detriment of existing clients at baillie gifford existing clients’ interests are paramount and we frequently close our products to new business to ensure that the integrity of our strategies and the quality of service are maintained this commitment to professional excellence ensures clients receive our full attentionthanks to our partnership structure we are free to focus entirely on our longterm vision to deliver the best results for our clients without the distraction of shortterm shareholder demands this singleminded approach has enabled us to enjoy relationships with clients that have spanned generations today we manage money on behalf of some of the world’s largest institutional investors we manage international portfolios for us and canadian clients and have a blue chip client base covering corporate public and foundation assets we have had asian clients since  and we manage funds for some of continental europe’s leading pension funds and financial institutionsour broad geographical exposure also encompasses institutional clients in australia singapore hong kong china thailand korea the middle east and south africa thanks to our partnership structure we are free to focus entirely on our longterm vision to deliver the best results for our clients partnership since  when baillie gifford was founded as an investment partnership the firm has been wholly owned by the people who invest for and look after our clients through each successive generation of partners our singular focus on generating superior longterm investment results for our clients has been the bedrock of our own growth baillie gifford today is wholly owned by its  partners – all of whom work within the firm growth has been organic with no mergers or acquisitions and we are committed to remaining independent this partnership style is rare among large investment management companies and creates one key advantage with no external shareholders demanding shortterm gains we can focus solely on what we do best seeking out longterm investment returns for our clients the organisational stability created by this ownership structure means that we can recruit and retain some of the best people in the industry and partnership encourages personal responsibility creating a strong culture of questioning debate and respectful trust in which the finest investment minds are nurtured and thrive this in turn means we can continue to find the best longterm investment opportunities it’s a virtuous circle that has served us well for over a century long term baillie gifford are longterm investors not speculators our investment philosophy focuses on growth while our universe is global in equities our belief is that sustained growth in company profits leads to higher share prices over time in bonds we take a differentiated investment approach which focuses on longterm prospects rather than the potential for shortterm price movements our rigorous process of fundamental analysis and proprietary research combined with a depth of expertise are core to a successful longterm bottomup investment approach this allows us to exploit global opportunities over periods of typically five years or more it’s a philosophy that has guided our investment strategy for  years so no one can say we don’t practice what we preach we are not interested in following fads and fashions or pursuing shortterm performance we are active investors driven to deliver valueadded performance after fees over the long term capabilities we actively manage specialist equity fixed income and multiasset portfolios for a global base as at  june  we have £bn under management equities in markets seduced by complexity we believe in keeping things simple we invest in what we believe to be the most competitive innovative and efficient growth companies over a century of global investment experience has taught us that patience is vital so we build longterm committed portfolios that aim to anticipate the next decade not the next quarter most importantly we love what we do and we don’t invest by rote or by numbers alone our analysts conduct rigorous qualitative fundamental analysis to determine whether to invest we know that the equity markets may not agree with us and that’s okay it’s more profitable to lead than to follow and we never stop questioning or challenging the status quo   fixed income we are different we are truly active investors looking to construct focused portfolios of longterm investments with a global opportunity set we invest in government bonds and currencies emerging market bonds investment grade and high yield our highly experienced investors undertake rigorous proprietary analysis focused on fundamental investment characteristics to identify attractive opportunities around the world we recognise that the asymmetric nature of bonds with capped upside makes risk management key to achieving our investment objective and it is integral to our approach multi asset we don’t believe in limiting our investment opportunities listed equities property high yield credit commodities emerging market government bonds and insurance linked securities – these are just some of the asset classes we invest in it is our core belief that diversifying across asset classes can reduce risk without significantly reducing returns maximising our investment opportunities raises the likelihood of finding individually attractive asset classes and also helps us to achieve a balanced and welldiversified portfolio we focus only on absolute risk and absolute return considering an asset class for its ability to enhance returns or reduce volatility we offer our clients access to a broad mix of asset classes through the convenience of a single activelymanaged portfolio   from edinburgh our research covers the globe we set no barriers to the imagination of our investors encouraging fresh perspectives and the use of diverse sources of information research in short we’re curious about the world and we truly believe that the best investment ideas spring from thinking about future possibilities not shortterm probabilities we appreciate of course that the world is complex but we believe that the way to generate longterm returns for our clients is to focus on the deceptively simple task of identifying and investing in those companies which have the potential to grow at a faster rate on a more sustainable basis than their peersso we conduct rigorous qualitative research to establish whether prospective investments have the competitive financial and strategic advantages to deliver on that potential and we love to share our insights our investment ideas are discussed and debated across our investment teams from those of the most junior analysts to partners of the firm we are always looking for that novel insight offbeat observation or penetrating challenge to help round out the investment case and enhance our collective knowledge and because there are no enduring right answers in investment we never stop asking questions related films request

gifford is an independent investment management firm based in edinburgh scotland with offices in london england and manhattan usa with just under  staff the firm manages more than £ billion us billion in active equity and bond portfolios for its clients in the uk and throughout the world combining experience enthusiasm and sound judgement this year and for the fourth time in  years baillie gifford overseas limited a wholly owned subsidiary of baillie gifford  co received the queen’s award for enterprise for its success in retaining and acquiring international clients datadvantage has enabled us to remove the risks associated with data permission changes within our it environment employees with responsibility for sensitive and critical data now have confidence that there are no security exposures as an organisation we can prove to our regulators that our it controls are stringent and that we are providing effective protection around our data – colin lennox technical services manager baillie gifford the challenge baillie gifford has been operating for over  years and since its inception over  years ago the information systems department has grown organically with the firm however increasingly it was discovering that network permissions set five years ago let alone before that were no longer valid this raised concerns that problems may exist within its security controls based on a microsoft windows operating system its environment comprises  servers – a mixture of both physical and virtual containing tb of data that continues to double year on year of these  servers ten are identified as key file servers containing sensitive data that must be protected at all costs incorporating client information and share portfolios hr records and financial accounts a team of ten people based in edinburgh are responsible for the day to day running security and permission management of these servers and all its  employees across the organisation have access albeit with different levels of permission with the security and integrity of its client information paramount baillie gifford needed to ensure this critical data was secure access to it limited and that its removal from the firm was correctly managed and maintained to do this it used various basic windows auditing solutions however these tools couldn’t provide the endtoend insight that baillie gifford required in conjunction the management effort required to produce accurate reports placed a heavy burden on the it team colin lennox baillie gifford’s technical services manager explains “we needed a solution that could provide evidence that the network permissions we have are secure and correctly assigned and that any potentially excessive permissions within the environment were not exposing vulnerabilities to our data” evaluation parameters as an active project baillie gifford knew it needed to improve the control visibility and manageability of its critical data colin adds “we wanted to revoke obsolete permissions and accurately consolidate access rights across the whole of our data structures to do this we needed to see who had access permissions but more importantly who was actually using it we could then alter permissions more effectively and without revoking access to teams who continually required access to perform their roles in addition baillie gifford had a strategy to give ownership of permission settings back to the key data managers within the firm it sounds a simple thing file system permissions but as colin explains “to give nontechnical people an easily understandable report with actionable highlights is actually quite difficult and time intensive to produce” the solution baillie gifford selected datadvantage since it was the only solution that addressed all their data access challenges especially in terms of meeting and proving regulatory compliance not only is datadvantage easy to install and maintain but its standard reports along with the user interface are easy to understand as colin adds “datadvantage was the only solution that i believed covered all our requirements for data access and permissions auditing plus the reports it produces even a layperson could quite easily pick up interpret and action plus the inbuilt ‘traffic light’ scheme clearly identifies excessive permissions and we quickly pinpointed areas that needed to be tightened” the security management improvements the solution provides to the organisation were evident during the evaluation period so the investment was easily justified and approved by baillie gifford’s internal risk committee working in partnership with varonis technical staff the deployment of the system was trouble free and within a month datadvantage had been rolled out across the whole firm weekly reports are created and sent electronically to the security officer the internal it department and more importantly those data managers responsible for the data classification in each area in contrast to the previous complicated paper reports datadvantage provides clear change control visibility with a graphical representation of changes highlighted on a week by week month by month basis its simplicity allows the data managers to navigate through the permissions themselves resolving any issues and regaining control everyone responsible for data protection now has confidence that is backed up with validation that the changes happening within the business are necessary and accurate – visibility that simply would not have been attainable previously testament to its success baillie gifford has started to roll out datadvantage to its sharepoint servers this is providing visibility to data that the it department previously had no visibility or insight of more importantly datadvantage is exposing any risks and providing an opportunity to tighten security permissions further colin added “although this investment was driven primarily by risk management and not by cost savings the fact that it is now so simple for those responsible to manage permission changes i estimate datadvantage has saved the organisation hundreds of man hours since its introduction” business benefits detailed yet understandable access permission reports historically baillie gifford would need to pull complex reports from each of its  servers – a confusing and labour intensive process today datadvantage brings it all together under one central interface simplifying the process and giving a holistic view from an enduser perspective the easily understandable reports provide relevant information to the key data managers improving their understanding of who has and is actually accessing their data and addressing any vulnerabilities posed complete data governance datadvantage has the ability to track historic changes and highlight when they’d taken place effectively wrapping up the change control system and providing evidence to external and internal audit teams demonstrating regulatory compliance minimal overhead and continued support since its deployment at the beginning of the year baillie gifford has been impressed by how little management overhead has been needed the solution is robust has minimal impact on the live environment and operates without the need for patches management and maintenance from its it team colin concludes “varonis has established a partnership with us providing assistance to our staff and ensuring we continue to get the most of datadvantage by utilising all its capabilities effectively if only all of our software vendors provided such great support” alan paterson baillie gifford  co ltdunited kingdom profile  biography  bloomberg feedback alan paterson chairman baillie gifford  co ltdunited kingdom career

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
