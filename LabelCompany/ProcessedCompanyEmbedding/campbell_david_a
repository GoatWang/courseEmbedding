wa add to my lists claim share copy the following code on your pageblog suggested widget size mobile desktop dave campbell has an unusual take on winning the  tcn career achievement award “honestly i have mixed emotions” he confesses while humbled by the recognition from his peers “i am not someone who likes it to be about me this is not an individual sport—it’s a team effort” then there’s the matter of his official title technical fellow and his role vice president of development for sql server this paring suggests a blend of technical acumen leadership skills and business savvy that is rather unique even in that upper stratosphere in which technical fellows ply their trade after  years at microsoft campbell continues to be a strong leader within the organization spearheading product development for microsoft sql server including microsoft azure sql database microsoft sql server business intelligence and enterprise information service products there’s more and we’ll get to that in a moment but first let’s look back at an early career that shaped this leader and innovator having earned a degree in mechanical engineering and a masters in robotics from clarkson university campbell joined sanders associates in  he faced leadership challenges from the day he walked in the door “i was the new robot guy they’d hired and i quickly realized that unless i earned the trust of the people on the floor i was never going to succeed ” he recalls “so i started solving some of their problems in a way that they could realize i was actually there to help them and not put them out of a job” campbell says this theme of trust has repeated itself over the course of his career and it is closely tied to a related concept he calls “design empathy” “when you are building a product that you would like to use it is easy to project yourself into it” he explains “but if you are building products for someone who is not like you it requires a lot more insight into what problem you are really solving i think those early experiences in terms of how to build automation for people who were afraid of it was actually quite fascinating” it wasn’t long before campbell’s notions about trust and design empathy would be put to a serious test his tenure at sanders was followed by a stint at digital equipment corporation then in  david vaskevitch recruited him as a developer and architect on the sql server storage engine team at the time the team was working with a code base acquired from sybase campbell notes that while sybase’s product had done an amazing job when it first shipped in the early s by the mids hardware had evolved to the point where the sybase architecture was becoming obsolete the marquee feature on which campbell was working at the time was row level locking—the concurrency controls that keep data consistent while multiple users are updating the database this was something contemporaneous database products had started to employ but microsoft sql server did not campbell engineered a workaround solution that got the job done but was a selfadmitted series of compromises he and the team came to the reluctant conclusion that the old architecture had to go and they needed to rewrite it not surprisingly this led to what campbell describes as an “interesting” meeting with bill gates who demanded to know why they would walk away from a product the company had acquired only a year or so previously according to campbell gates listened and seemed to understand the imperative but then gates asked the tough question if this is so important why isn’t sybase doing it silence ensued “we had never really considered that” says campbell “i remember us looking at each other and thinking how are we going to answer this” fortunately after a little thought gates himself provided a solution asking as campbell paraphrases it “is it because they don’t have the guts” the team grabbed the lifeline “yeah that’s it” the project was on having won gates’s trust it was time to move on to design empathy at the time enterprise database products were incredibly complex to run each had hundreds of configuration knobs and as campbell puts it “very few people on the planet knew what these things did” at the time knowing how to configure the various arcane configuration parameters was seen as a rite of passage for database administrators less experienced administrators would ask questions in discussion groups and by email around how to set the parameters and the seasoned veterans would reply with their opinions even the experts would debate such minutia as the number of hash buckets to allocate for the buffer pool the systems needed to be more dynamic and campbell drew on his background in robotics and control theory to do it a slapyourforehead moment came with the realization that the development team could encode the knowledge on how to set the obscure parameters into the product creating a product that became aware of and adapted to its environment based on query patterns and workload a parallel achievement was reducing the array of configuration knobs from more than  to a more manageable  it was elegant and it dramatically reduced the cost of administration a critical aspect of the undertaking was the fact that they had to keep the product operational while the rewrite happened “we went from the sybase server to the sql server completely changed its guts and keeping it going the whole time at the end it spoke the same query language but most everything else was new it was a fascinating experiment i tell people we changed a cow into a horse by changing one organ at a time while keeping it alive” sql server  would go on to establish the foundation for the future success of sql server in the database market an independent microsoft design that would become a multibilliondollar business the team grew significantly for sql  and again for sql  at this point campbell explains a new problem emerged “we had gotten to the point where the complexity and scale of the product and the team outstripped our processes we realized that we now had to go back and reorganize our development process” in short just two cycles after completely reengineering the database it was time to completely reengineer the way in which they built the database to do this campbell stepped out of his broad supervisory role and assembled a small team warning them that it would be an incredibly difficult journey both technically and culturally “and so we went off and did it” he says “and it was incredibly hard and we got arrows in our back and people came into my office and said ‘i can’t believe how painful this is’ but we got through it and sql server  as a result of this shift was by far the greatest initial quality release we ever had” of course as hinted earlier campbell’s story does not end with sql server in  he became involved in an internal microsoft project called cloud db “in that first year we learned how to build and deploy a service on this engine we were developing this cloud db engine” he explains “and in the second year in august of  we deployed an internet scale service an email archiving service based upon that engine and then in november of  we launched sql azure with windows azure so that was a fantastic phase where we basically went after these cloud services” campbell is being modest there are plenty more products and services he could name microsoft streaminsight app fabric cache service bus relay access control services the list goes on he personally hired and presently leads a team of experts to accelerate the machinelearning deployment in microsoft’s big data information services and service insight efforts campbell points to longtime colleague peter spiro as one of the first to insist the company move over to cloud services now retired spiro received the  career achievement award campbell himself was quick to get on board “when a truly new technology comes along it presents an opportunity for doing things completely differently even though we initially use it to mirror the old” he explains “today people still think of the cloud as infrastructure replacement—instead of buying my own servers i can just rent them but in reality the cloud will present new architectural opportunities and completely new business models and that is where microsoft has been leading” but having said that this technical fellow and vice president of development can’t help but put on his bizdev hat “the question is where is the market acceptance on that for me the strategy whether from a technical perspective or a business perspective is about trying to understand a complex dynamic system” campbell’s career has seen him move back and forth between teams of all sizes from small groups of  to organizations of  spread around the world he insists that as long as he has a worthy challenge he is happy his approach to management “i try to be situational and i try to understand things from a systems perspective” he says “my style would be to establish a solid frame communicate that frame and then operate within it” and finally when it comes to his legacy it shouldn’t be surprising that a man who shuns individual awards prefers to think of the bigger picture “i would like to be remembered as one of the people who helped establish and maintain a great engineering culture where the focus was on the product on the customer and on doing things the right way a way that was built to last” says campbell “when i first got here i would go home at night and feel proud of the code i wrote that day” he says “then there was a period where i was proud of the product we developed then i became proud of the team we developed then i became proud of the fact that we had been able to go new places “the test is whether you can walk away and see it live on if you write some elegant code then someone can maintain that and maybe learn something from it but if you set up a culture then the team can take on things that are completely new that is more durable and lasting i never want it to be about me i want it to be about what we have done and will do”  companies in career na related markets  colleagues  related investments alias dave campbell industry computer software tags distributed systems scalability software design
