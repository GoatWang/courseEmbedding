adopt the same principles of competition and accountability as exist in the private and nonprofit sectors they will continue to deteriorate says hastings one way to permanently impact the system would

once you have hitchhiked across africa with ten bucks in your pocket starting a business doesnt seem too intimidating  after returning from the peace corps hastings went on to attend stanford university he graduated in  with a masters degree in computer science founding of pure softwareedit hastings first job was at adaptive technology where he invented a tool for debugging software i worked for audrey maclean in  when she was ceo at adaptive corp from her i learned the value of focus i learned it is better to do one product well than two products in a mediocre way says hastings hastings left adaptive technology in  to found his first company pure software which produced products to troubleshoot software the rapidly growing company soon proved challenging for hastings as he lacked managerial experience as the company grew from  to  to  to  to  employees i found i was definitely underwater and over my head said hastings i was doing whitewater kayaking at the time and in kayaking if you stare and focus on the problem you are much more likely to hit danger i focused on the safe water and what i wanted to happen i didn’t listen to the skeptics hastings engineering background didnt prepare him for the challenges of being a ceo and he asked his board to replace him i tried to fire myself — twice hastings says i was losing confidence the board refused and hastings says he learned to be a businessman i was an engineer myself we doubled our revenue every year but my transformation from engineer to ceo was when morgan stanley took the company public in  in  pure

better business model you could pay  or  a month and work out as little or as much as you wanted hastings said that when he founded netflix he had no idea whether customers would use the service netflix was originally a single rental service but the subscription model was one of a few ideas we had—so there was no aha moment having unlimited due dates and no late fees has worked in a powerful way and now seems obvious but at that time we had no idea if consumers would even build and use an online queue netflix cultureedit after his experiences at pure atria hastings was concerned with the problems of growth if building an entertainment company was his public goal his private goal was to build a company that would grow rapidly without losing its entrepreneurial spirit in the process netflix was a testbed for his theories as netflix grew the company began getting noticed for its innovative management practices—the results of the culture hastings was exploring—called freedom and responsibility netflix is known to pay salaries that are typically much higher than customary to attract the best talent and is one of the few companies where employees can choose annually how much of their compensation they want in cash vs stock were unafraid to pay high says hastings other innovations include their treatment of employees who dont meet expectations at most companies average performers get an average raise says hastings at netflix they get a generous severance package because that way managers dont feel too guilty to let average performers go the company also gained notoriety for eliminating sick and vacation time for employees and instead allowing them to manage this time off individually hastings would meet each new employee and discuss the culture and his theories about it over the years his personal presentation codified into a powerpoint slide deck that was widely shared internally reviewed and tweaked by upper management and refined actively in

 million times internet televisionedit hastings is a proponent of internet television and sees it as the future i think theres a huge category of people who will watch movies on laptops says hastings and remember its not the laptop of today think of the laptop in five years people will continue to want to watch movies on tv no doubt about it but laptop screens are improving and young people are living on laptops he credits youtube for his shift in strategy for developing a video streaming service netflix launched a service in  to stream movies and television to computers what were finding is that young people under  are watching our streaming on their pcs in huge numbers says hastings they operate more portably than we do with our big screen tvs controversyedit in july  netflix announced that subscription prices were changing that dvd rental prices would drop by  but that the initially free streaming service would now be charged for many customers this represented a savings but for the group that both received discs and enjoyed streaming it would result in a cost increase of up to  the move led to reported customer backlash cancellations lower than projected subscriber growth and a decline in stock price in response netflix admitted to poor public relations decisions in announcing the change but kept its policy in place two months later in september  netflix announced that it would spin off its popular dvd business under a new brand name qwikster leading to customer and market confusion netflix reversed the decision less than a month later during this time the companys

have been material missteps if you look at the cumulative track record its extremely positive other business interestsedit hastings has been a director of the board of facebook since june  as of

for local schools to pass construction bond issues from  to  percent in  hastings ran into trouble on the state board of education when democratic legislators challenged hastings’ advocacy of more english instruction and language testing for nonenglishspeaking students the california senate rules committee refused to confirm him as the board president the california state legislature rejected him in january  governor arnold schwarzenegger who had reappointed hastings to the board after hastings first term issued a statement saying he was disappointed in the committee’s action hastings resigned on april   steven maviglio reported that hastings had made a  contribution to california governor schwarzeneggers voters first redistricting campaign charter schoolsedit hastings is active in educational philanthropy and politics one of the issues hastings most strongly advocates is charter schools publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules regulations and statutes that apply to other public schools in exchange for some type of accountability for producing certain results which are set forth in each schools charter if public schools dont adopt the same principles of competition and accountability as exist in the private and nonprofit sectors they will continue to deteriorate says hastings one way to permanently impact the system would be to have  to  percent of california schoolchildren enrolled in charter schools that would be critical mass and enough of a force to induce a competitive dynamic in the system he added hastings is a founding member of newschoolsorg aspire public schools pacific collegiate school and edvoicenet on july   the santa cruz sentinel reported that hastings had donated  million in startup funds to beacon education network to open up new charter schools in santa cruz county where he lives small schools arent for everyone but in some kids they work better in terms of academic preparation for college hastings said the small school focus is particularly true for students who dont get as much academic support at home on march   hastings delivered the keynote address at the california charter school association meeting in san jose california during this speech he argued for the elimination of elected school boards saying in part the fundamental problem with school districts is not their fault the fundamental problem is that they don’t get to control their boards and the importance of the charter school movement is to evolve america from a system where governance is constantly changing and you can’t do long term planning to a system of large nonprofits  in response california school board association jo lucey said public oversight of local government is the foundation of american democracy nowhere is this more evident than in our public schools where voters entrust boards of education with the education of our youth newark new jersey elected school board member and former deputy mayor alturrick kenney and milwaukee wisconsin teachers union president bob peterson responded to hastings by saying that unelected school boards are not democratic they added that elected school boards are necessary to slowdown the process of privatization of public schools and that unelected school boards work to expand privately managed charter schools kenney and peterson also said privately run charter schools are not run democratically have relatively little accountability and the data does not show charter schools outperform public schools technologyedit hastings is a member of technology

hastings most strongly advocates is charter schools publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules regulations and statutes that apply to other public schools in exchange for some type of accountability for producing certain results which are set forth in each schools charter if public schools dont adopt the same principles of competition and accountability as exist in the private and nonprofit sectors they will continue to deteriorate says hastings one way to permanently impact the system would be to have  to  percent of california schoolchildren enrolled in charter schools that would be critical mass and enough of a force to induce a competitive dynamic in the system he added hastings is a founding member of newschoolsorg

is particularly true for students who dont get as much academic support at home on march   hastings delivered the keynote address at the california charter school association meeting in san jose california during this speech he argued for the elimination of elected school boards saying in part the fundamental problem with school districts is not their fault the fundamental problem is that they don’t get to control their boards and the importance of the charter school movement is to evolve america from a system where governance is constantly changing and you can’t do long term planning to a system of large nonprofits  in response california school board association jo lucey said public oversight of local government is the foundation of american democracy nowhere is this more evident than in our public schools where voters entrust boards of education with the education of our youth newark new jersey elected school board member and former deputy mayor alturrick kenney and milwaukee wisconsin teachers union president bob peterson responded to hastings by saying that unelected school boards are not democratic they added that elected school boards are necessary to slowdown the process of privatization of public schools and that unelected school boards work to expand privately managed charter schools kenney and peterson also said privately run charter schools are not run democratically have relatively little accountability and the data does not show charter schools outperform public schools technologyedit hastings is a member of technology network a political network
