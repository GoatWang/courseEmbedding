strength a consistent scorer and creator of goals he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or oneonones müller describes this role as raumdeuter a term that translates to interpreter of space cf raumdeuter space interpreter during  world cup germany manager joachim löw stated that müller is a very unorthodox player and you

berlinbased video artist experimental musician painter and photographer for an exhibition in  he burned three of his oil paintings and displayed the resulting pile of ashes as a sculpture entitled three of my favourite pictures these particular ashes were reused in new paintings some of which have again been burned to produce further ashes for further paintings thus began a cycle of ashbased works entitled not a bird ranging from large canvas paintings to postcards sometimes enriched with pigment the paintings were used as source material for video installations and exhibitions or simply burned to produce more ashes müller considers the process of burning and the resulting ashes as a means of transcendence and purification for this reason he only uses the ashes of objects related to himself this lp brings together not a bird and müllers longtime preoccupation with richard wagners rheingold the piece originally conceived as a video consists of countless layers of rheingold
