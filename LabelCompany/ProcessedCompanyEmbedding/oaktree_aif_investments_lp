 pm eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings has affirmed the longterm issuer default ratings idrs of oaktree capital group llc and its related entities collectively oaktree at a the rating outlook is stable approximately  million of unsecured debt is affected by these actions a complete list of ratings is detailed at the end of this release todays rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic peer review of the alternative investment manager im industry which comprises seven publicly rated global firms fitchs outlook for the sector is stable reflecting the relative stability of core operating fundamentals given the lockedin nature of a large portion of fee revenue modest but increased leverage levels manageable nearterm obligations relative to available liquidity resources increasing asset under management aum diversity and investors increasing allocation to alternative investments particularly those managed by alternative ims with strong franchises such as those included in fitchs peer review while fund realization activity has increased significantly over the last three years leading to the amortization of existing aum managers have continued to replace capital and therefore fees with followon funds and expansion into other product categories through stepout strategies seed investments andor acquisitions the variable cost structure of the alternative ims has contributed to relatively steady cash flows through cycles feerelated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization febitda margins had been trending down in recent years given lower fee rates on new product categories higher fundraising costs and because the cost of doing business has risen with increased regulation and administrative costs associated with operating as public companies however febitda margins have turned a corner more recently as many alternative ims have begun to raise followon funds for newer strategies which adds scale to the platform the febitda margin for a category alternative ims averaged  for the trailing  months ttm ended sept   which compared to a  average for  leverage levels have increased across the industry as issuers have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue longduration funding and have also used debt financing for acquisition purposes average leverage defined as debt divided by febitda was x for a category firms for the ttm ending sept   which compared to an average of x at yearend  fitch believes the issuances have been largely opportunistic and views the reduction in refinancing risk favorably over time fitch expects leverage levels to migrate toward historical averages as cash proceeds are deployed into febitdagenerating opportunities and recent acquisitions begin to contribute to consolidated results while core issuer fundamentals remain solid alternative ims continue to have record levels of capital to invest at a time when conditions are increasingly challenging therefore there is more capital chasing fewer deals which could lead to significant fund underperformance if competition bids prices up further outsized vintage concentration could potentially exacerbate this issue while most of the large managers have operated through a variety of market cycles and have demonstrated investment restraint pressure for returns from limited partners remains high given the length of time that interest rates have been at low absolute levels that said a meaningful portion of the industrys uncalled capital is not yet earning fees often referred to as shadow aum which could provide some material upside to alternative im febitda as the capital is deployed key rating drivers idrs and senior debt the rating affirmations for oaktree reflect its strong position as a global alternative im solid investment track record experienced and deepened management team large base of feeearning assets under management faum strong blended management fee rate given the absence of a stepdown in the management fee percentage once closedend funds enter their liquidation period a lack of reliance on transaction and monitoring fees for revenue incentive incomegenerating capability growing investment income from oaktrees investment in doubleline solid liquidity and subordination of general partner interests to outstanding indebtedness rating constraints for the alternative im space include key man risk which is institutionalized throughout many limited partnership agreements reputational risk which can impact the companys ability to raise future funds and legal and regulatory risk which could alter the alternative asset space rating constraints more specific to oaktree include lower relative aum diversity higher exposure to net asset value navbased fees and reduced operating margins which could impact the firms financial flexibility faum amounted to  billion at sept   down about  from q due largely to realizations in closedend funds and negative valuation movements in openend funds openend fund faum declined  over the ttm ended sept   as relatively neutral net flows were hurt by foreign exchange and market value declines closedend faum is down  yearoveryear and  below yearend  levels given continued realizations in legacy funds still the decline in faum overshadows what has been a very strong fundraising period for the firm for the ttm ended sept   oaktree received  billion in closedend capital commitments fitch expects faum to grow in coming quarters as  billion of capital was raised but not yet earning management fees as of sept   fees will be turned on when funds begin their investment period or when the capital is deployed which will provide meaningful upside to oaktrees revenue the firms newest distressed debt funds oaktree opportunities fund x and xb had nearly  billion of aggregate committed capital at sept   including  billion in fund x which should start its investment period and thus full management fees in  oaktrees core operating performance was down in the first three quarters of  as management fees declined inline with faum and core compensation tickedup as a result the firms febitda margin declined to  which was slightly below the peergroup average on a ttm basis even so fitch expects the firm to reach an inflection point in  as record levels of undeployed aum gradually begin to generate fees which will allow for margin expansion given the scalability of the platform performance fees and investment income have come down as oaktrees realization cycle started a bit earlier than the peer group given its credit focus however accrued performance fees remain strong amounting to  billion at sept   or nearly  million net of associated compensation expense fitch does not view the accrual as a liquid asset but it does point to potential future income generation and cash flow oaktrees leverage as measured by longterm debt divided by febitda amounted to x on a ttm basis at sept   which compares to x at yearend  the uptick reflects the decline in febitda however leverage is overstated by  million of  debt maturities which were effectively prefunded with oaktrees  senior note issuance removing the  maturities from total debt reduces leverage to x which is still above fitchs general leverage tolerance for a category firms of x fitch believes leverage may increase a bit further over the next few quarters as fund realizations yield a decline in management fees but leverage is expected to decline to x or below over the medium term as capital not yet earning fees begins to generate fees in  additionally if fitch were to include nonperformance investment income that oaktree earns from its investment in doubleline leverage would be approximately x on a ttm basis removing the  maturities from total debt this income stream which is tied largely to management fees has increased significantly over time as doublelines faum has grown fitch will continue to monitor the stability and predictability of this income stream over time but it has improved the firms cash flow generation in recent periods fitch believes oaktree has a solid liquidity profile at sept   oaktree had  million of balance sheet cash  million of government securities and  million of borrowing capacity on its bank revolver this compares to  million of debt maturities in  and  million of aggregate general partner commitments to the funds as of sept   in q oaktree increased its standard payout ratio from  to  of its distributable earnings retaining the rest for fund coinvestments possible corporate transactions and enhanced liquidity fitch is comfortable with the updated policy given the firms sound liquidity position but would expect the firm to reduce shareholder distributions should corporate cash demands increase in october  oaktree appointed its first ceo jay wintrob who had been an outside director of the company since  and who ran aigs life and retirement division until september  wintrob will be focused on the daytoday administration of the firm in addition to a variety of strategic initiatives fitch believes the ceo appointment reflects the growth diversity and continued globalization of the platform and an addition to executive management depth given wintrobs prior experience on the board fitch does not expect wholesale strategic changes resulting from this change the stable outlook reflects fitchs expectations that management fees will increase in  as shadow aum begins to generate management fees which will allow for modest margin expansion and balance sheet deleveraging the outlook also reflects the agencys belief that oaktree will growretain faum through the raising of new and expansion of existing fund strategies and retain a solid liquidity profile in order to fund operations and meet coinvestment commitments to the funds rating sensitivities idrs and senior debt fitch believes positive rating momentum for oaktree is limited given its current rating levels and the nature and risk profile of the business including the impact that key man events andor reputational damage can have on the franchise and future fundraising prospects however positive momentum could develop over time with a meaningful reduction in key man risk an increase in fund and fee diversity enhanced stability of incentive income through a variety of market cycles stronger funding diversity and declines in leverage declines in investment performance a key man event andor legislative risk which negatively impact the companys ability to raise faum and generate fees meaningful increases in leverage andor impairment of the liquidity profile could result in negative rating
