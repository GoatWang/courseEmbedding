introduce your students to image processing with the industry’s most prized text for  years image processing has been the foundational text for the study of digital image processing the book is suited for students at the college senior and firstyear graduate level with prior background in mathematical analysis vectors matrices probability statistics linear systems and computer programming as in all earlier editions the focus of this edition of the book is on fundamentals the th edition which celebrates the book’s th anniversary is based on an extensive survey of faculty students and independent readers in  institutions from  countries their feedback led to expanded or new coverage of topics such as deep learning and deep neural networks including convolutional neural nets the scaleinvariant feature transform sift maximallystable extremal regions msers graph cuts kmeans clustering and superpixels active contours snakes and level sets and exact histogram matching  major improvements were made in reorganizing the material on image transforms into a more cohesive presentation and in the discussion of spatial kernels and spatial filtering  major revisions and additions were made to examples and homework exercises throughout the book for the first time we added matlab projects at the end of every chapter and compiled support packages for you and your teacher containing solutions

format hardcoververified purchasethis is a good introduction to image processingthe first chapters introduce the readers to the fundamentals of human vision and how the brain processes light contrast and color the examples are clear and understandableas the book progresses the subjects become more complex and mathematicallyoriented i found that i could follow up with those topics in which i had prior background like intensity transformations spatial filtering filtering in the frequency domain color image processing image compression and image segmentation in these topics i understood most of what they were explaining except maybe the last pages of each chapterwhen it came to chapters where i was weaker or not familiar at all i have to admit that i was able to keep up only with the first pages of each one more specifically wavelets and multithreshold processing morphological image processing representation fuzzy logic and object recognition these chapters became muddy very quickly and i only got a general feeling about what they were explainingmaybe someone with an electrical engineering background myself being mechanicalsoftware would understand better the advanced topicsi plan to read them again once i have a practical need or use for those areasthe book does not contain code samples but it has quite a lot of practical use examples with picturesin summary i understood roughly  of the book and would recommend it to anyone who needs a better understanding of image processingbest regardsariread more comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport

image processing having read most of the st edition yes im reading all of the rd i can say that this rd edition is larger yet not insurmountable with more examples explanations mathematical development and new material im currently in the chapter about frequency domain processing and must say that the previous chapter about spatial domain processing is more robust even now including a good introduction to fuzzy logic anyhow with a good background in applied math and matlab programming this material is easy reading for me but should also be accessible enough for anyone with a

hardcoververified purchasei just completed a semester of digital image processing where this was the course textbook of the myriad textbooks i have used over the years this one is definitely at the top of my list in terms of its clarity and organization i ended up reading at least two thirds of this textbook and the way that the authors present the material makes it very clear in most cases i came away with the sense that the authors expended a great deal of effort in illustrating and explaining the concepts  more so than many textbooks i have encountered especially those at the graduate engineering levelmy only criticism is that certain parts of chapters  and  seemed a bit too extensive for an introductory image processing text however they were still good chapters and so i dont think that it warrants a deduction of a star in my ratingi highly recommend this text if you need to take an image processing courseread morecomment one person found this helpful was this review
