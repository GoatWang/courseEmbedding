resigns henry knueppel chosen as interim replacement print email ed komenda the patriotnews by ed komenda the patriotnews the patriotnews follow on twitter on february   at  am comments to midstate shareholders attracted to local stocks harsco corp hasn’t had much allure these days    the wormleysburgbased company’s portfolio has dropped about  percent since hitting its peak of  in  stalling at  on friday when the fortune  company announced the resignation of its chairman and ceo salvatore d view full sizesalvatore d fazzolarifazzolari   officials contended the company has underdelivered over the past two years and needs new leadership    “a new leader will better position the company to deliver shareholder value” company spokesman ken julian said    the company’s board of directors named henry w knueppel a member of the board as interim ceo until a permanent replacement is found    harsco a company worth  billion provides industrial services and engineered products primarily to steel construction railways and energy industries worldwide employing  employees at  sites in  countries    it’s a big company and it’s footprint stretches across the world as more than  percent of its employees work outside the united states    without a stake in company you probably wouldn’t notice its global headquarters overlooking the susquehanna river where about  employees work    the company sponsors the harsco science center in the whitaker center for science and the arts in harrisburg but doug thomas a research analyst said most wouldn’t recognize the name    “it’s not mcdonald’s or hershey” said thomas president of lancasterbased jet research investments “no one knows what they do”    and you wouldn’t know of its struggles    fazzolari’s exit followed the heels of  million loss in the company’s infrastructure branch — an almost  billion operation that includes the building of highways and buildings — since     harsco’s stock dropped about  percent during that time moving from a peak of about  in  to  at the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on friday the decline comes as the rest of the market is enjoying a surge to heights not seen in years    what happened    the giant might have grown too big for its own good some analysts say    it’s a problem fazzolari who started at harsco as an auditor  years ago might have inherited when he took over as ceo in  before the global economy soured said robert norfleet iii a stock analyst with bbt capital markets    “they are way too spread out” norfleet said “they had offices everywhere”    harsco had  offices in 9 and bought new equipment for every construction project norfleet said in both  and  harsco spent about  million on equipment about half of the branch’s operating costs    harsco spent a lot of money hoping to make even more norfleet said    but during the process the company notched several highprofile projects    harsco supplied the equipment used in the construction of burj khalifa formerly known as burj dubai the world’s tallest building in the united arab emirates    new york city’s bank of america tower considered by some to be one of the world’s greenest office buildings is equipped with harsco hotwater systems    the company also helped build the marina bay sands the largest resort in singapore    and then the bottom fell out    confidence crumbled with the collapse of the economy at the end of  people stopped building and harsco was left with unused equipment expensive offices and droves of employees with no work to do industry analysts say    in  harsco’s infrastructure branch made a  million profit and brought in less than half that in 9 logging 8 million    in  harsco decided to close offices and cut staff to balance their budget    over the next two years the company closed  branch offices  administration offices and axed about 8 people    the cuts accounted for a  percent decline in harsco’s infrastructure operations and cost the company  million in restructuring charges    in total the infrastructure branch lost  million in  and ze¤’    this year harsco has already lost about 8 million norfleet said    so how do you fix it    more cuts norfleet said    “there is a way out of this fazzolari did a lot” he added “perhaps the company is looking for someone with fresh eyes with more aggressive restructuring initiatives”    derek hathaway who has been particularly quiet about the company’s progress since his departure as ceo in  offered little comment friday    “it saddens me to see him go” he said “and i wish the company the best of luck in choosing its new leader”  interim ceo   name henry w knueppel   age      what he brings “we are grateful that henry knueppel a proven industry leader with deep knowledge of our company and its broad international reach has agreed to step into the interim role during this transition period” said kathy g eddy lead independent director of the harsco board of directors     background knueppel holds degrees from ripon college and the university of wisconsin whitewater     he has served on the harsco board of directors since september  and recently retired as the chairman and ceo of
