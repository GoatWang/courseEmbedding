candidate mst purified poloxamer  is an investigational agent that has potential to reduce ischemic tissue injury and endorgan damage by restoring microvascular function which is compromised in a wide range of serious and lifethreatening diseases and conditions we initially are developing mst as a treatment for complications arising from sickle cell disease learn more about mst   air   this page contains forward looking statements air is a sodium nitrite solution for intermittent inhalation via nebulizer nitrite is a direct vasodilator and can be recycled in vivo to form nitric oxide no independent of the classical no synthase nos pathway nitrite mediated no formation has several beneficial effects including dilation of blood vessels and reduction of inflammation and undesirable cell growth generation of no from sodium nitrite is not dependent upon endothelial function and is enhanced in the setting of tissue hypoxia and acidosis conditions in which nos activity typically is depressed in early clinical studies air demonstrated positive hemodynamic effects with reductions observed in right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as well as improvements in mean pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac output we are developing air for treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef a condition that affects millions in the us and for which no proven therapeutic agent is available numerous lines of evidence suggest that hfpef is a disease of no deficiency we are supporting two institutionsponsored phase a studies in patients with hfpef to evaluate acute hemodynamic effects of air and to evaluate its acute effects versus placebo on submaximal oxygen consumption and exercise hemodynamics how does air work   air inhalation solution is sodium nitrite formulated with a phosphate buffer into an inhalation solution nitrite is a physiological signaling molecule with roles in intravascular endocrine nitric oxide no production hypoxic vasodilation signaling and cytoprotection after ischemiareperfusion nitrite serves as the largest physiologic reservoir of no and can be converted to no independent of no synthase nos activity in experimental models nitrite use demonstrated improved remodeling both in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricle hemodynamic effects include venodilation with reductions in right atrial pressures pulmonary and systemic vasodilation with reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and left atrial pressures and improved cardiac relaxation in addition recent clinical and nonclinical studies have demonstrated that nitrite can stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion and decrease mitochondrial oxygen consumption through a mechanism distinct from that of no which may have utility in treating heart failure air clinical data   we obtained the air program through our acquisition of aires pharmaceuticals inc in february  prior to the acquisition air had been tested in more than  healthy volunteers and patients with various forms of pulmonary hypertension in three phase  studies and in one phase  study in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension while the phase  study was prematurely terminated due to aires’ capital constraints prior to the acquisition preliminary data from the study are positive showing improvements in hemodynamic parameters and in exercise capacity from baseline there were no treatmentrelated serious adverse events and methemoglobin levels remained normal   which distinguishes air from safety concerns associated with intravenouslyadministered nitrite data from these early clinical studies support continued clinical development of air given the observed hemodynamic improvements of decreased right arterial pressure decreased pulmonary capillary wedge or left atrial pressure as well as improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac lusitropic effects air may benefit patients with exercise impairment due to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef for whom these are all desirable effects   potential applications of air hemodynamic improvements improvements in pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac lusitropic effects observed in earlier studies of air support air’s potential to benefit patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef we currently are pursuing clinical development of air for that patient population    activities event timing initiate tqtqtc study completed secure orphan designation for mst for scd in eu completed activate first site in

share this article san diego sept   prnewswire  mast therapeutics inc nyse mkt mstx a biopharmaceutical company developing novel clinicalstage therapies for sickle cell disease and heart failure today reported topline results from epic a phase  clinical study of its investigational new drug vepoloxamer also known as mst for the treatment of individuals with sickle cell disease experiencing vasoocclusive crisis voc  the study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the mean duration of voc  hours in the vepoloxamer group compared to  hours in the placebo group in the intenttotreat population p  there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the intenttotreat population across the two secondary efficacy endpoints rate of rehospitalization for voc and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome consistent with previously conducted studies vepoloxamer was generally well tolerated with no statistically significant differences in treatmentrelated serious adverse events in the vepoloxamer group compared to the placebo group no deaths occurred on the study we are exceedingly disappointed with these topline results while clearly not the outcome we wanted we believe the insights and data from the largest placebocontrolled clinical trial ever completed in sickle cell disease will substantially advance the understanding of vasoocclusive crisis and the still maturing clinical science necessary to support the development of new therapeutics for this debilitating disease stated brian m culley the companys chief executive officer we wish to reiterate our sincere appreciation for all of the patients caregivers and others who aided us in conducting this informative study these analyses are limited to just topline data so in the coming weeks the company intends to review the full data set from epic in addition we plan to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing heart failure trial of vepoloxamer however based on the data weve seen to date we expect we will terminate all clinical development of vepoloxamer consequently while we evaluate our options we intend to significantly and immediately reduce our operating expenses and continue our efforts with air our lead asset in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction which currently is the subject of a

about the epic study  the epic study was a randomized doubleblind twoarm placebocontrolled phase  clinical trial of vepoloxamer in individuals with sickle cell disease hospitalized for acute pain typical of vasoocclusive crisis who required treatment with parenteral opioid analgesia the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of vepoloxamer in reducing the duration of vasoocclusive crisis with the duration of crisis measured from the time of randomization to the time at which the patient received the last dose of parenteral opioid analgesia for the treatment of vasoocclusive crisis prior to hospital discharge  vepoloxamer or placebo  saline was administered intravenously as a  hour loading dose infusion  mgkg immediately followed by a continuous maintenance infusion  mgkghr for at least  hours and up to  hours  randomization was stratified by age ≥ to  years or ≥ to ≤ years use of hydroxyurea yes or no and pain score measured using the wongbaker faces® pain rating scale at time of randomization  or ≥ the study was  powered to detect a  hour difference in treatment arms with a statistical significance level of p assuming an average crisis duration of  hours in the control arm and a coefficient of variation    secondary efficacy endpoints were to compare the rates of rehospitalization for vasoocclusive crisis within  days of initial hospital discharge and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome within  hours of randomization between the treatment and control groups a total of  patients ages four to  were randomized in epic  more than  study sites in  countries participated  the average age was  years  patients under age  accounted for approximately  of total subjects  approximately  of patients were concurrently on hydroxyurea therapy  about sickle cell disease and vasoocclusive crisissickle cell disease is a chronic genetic blood disorder that affects millions worldwide and an estimated  people in the united states where it is classified as a rare or orphan disease  the hallmark of sickle cell disease is vasoocclusive crisis which results from obstruction of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells causing tissue ischemia and injury  vasoocclusions can occur everywhere blood flows and lead to an accumulating disease burden in every organ system with the ultimate loss of vital organ function and significantly reduced lifespan  vasoocclusive crisis is also characterized by intense and debilitating pain which can last for days and even weeks  there are between  to  hospitalizations annually in the us related
