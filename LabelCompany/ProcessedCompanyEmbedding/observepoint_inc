contact customers partners news and media careers frequently asked questions download pdf what is tag management tag management is the process of monitoring and maintaining marketing tags integrated into digital properties a tag management system tms is a solution usually provided by a thirdparty vendor that simplifies the processes of implementing maintaining and sunsetting the increasing number of tag implementations an organization employs tag management also includes auditing and scanning your digital properties to identify all thirdparty and custom tagging implementations to validate accurate deployment and data collection even after implementing a tag management solution things break—tags go missing or are duplicated links break and javascript code is corrupted old thirdparty implementations are not fully eradicated etc this is why it is important to have people tools and process in place to ensure effective tag management discover more about tag management what is the difference between an audit and a simulation audits are prescriptive simulations are protective audits can tell you about tagging issues that need to be fixed and simulations can alert you when new tagging problems appear read more on our blog site audit and simulations what’s the difference which vendors do you support observepoint is integrated with every major digital marketing technology we use selenium so would we use that in conjunction with observepoint yes observepoint contributes to an overall data quality practice manual page level debugging automated site audits tag regression testing selenium scripts and so forth can all contribute to improved data quality it’s important to understand that none of these are onetime events—there has to be an ongoing commitment to achieve highquality data do you do mobile yes we support all mobile browsers why have i not heard of observepoint before hard to say how long has it been since you took the red pill can i see variable data yes since observepoint is executing javascript all javascript parameters and values are stored in the tag database after an audit and available as test criteria in simulations isn’t a onetime audit enough no websites are complex and always evolving one audit is great for telling you what is a problem today but data quality management is a process most effectively performed on an ongoing basis if i have a tag management system do i still need to audit yes tag management systems are great and help teams become more efficient and sophisticated they also introduce additional tagging to the site and can cause blind spots how difficult is an implementation with observepoint it’s not difficult—there’s no code to deploy observepoint requires a configuration of the audits simulations and reports rather than any deployment to your sites does page performance impact data collection it can for example if the tag is in the bottom portion of the page that is loading slowly the page view might not be recorded in the web analytics solution consequently this page might falsely show very low page views can observepoint audit behind logins yes observepoint can simulate visitor actions such as a user login we recommend automating this and this is a very common practice among our customers how long does it take to implement observepoint a few days there is no code to deploy so all setup is done through our user interface how often do you recommend auditing this depends on your business needs but generally our customers find the most value aligning with their release cycles reacting to business conditions that dictate audits and performing proactive audits in anticipation of large project releases for more information about audit frequency and timing read about the data quality management process we’re having data collection challenges with different browsers and devices can you help yes observepoint supports a variety of browser agents and devices do you handle onclick or custom action events yes our patented technology actively interacts with your website’s user interface and most of the time this is selfconfigured in our platform we’re about to change web analytics vendors should we wait to audit until the new deployment is done don’t wait auditing now can help you be sure that you have completely removed any old tags from your website and correctly deployed your new solution my team doesn’t have much confidence in our web data what should i do start with some baseline audits to get an idea of what your data quality challenges are once you’ve done that you can make a plan to measure improve and protect your data using our data quality management platform and processes how to use the observepoint tagdebugger™ observepoint tagdebugger™ is an excellent alternative for web analysts who may currently use one or more of the following wasp charles fiddler omnibug sitecat debugger omniture debugger digitalpulse debugger or google tag assistant use the tagdebugger™ install the tag debugger ensure the extension is enabled by selecting tools  extensions and verifying the observepoint tag debugger is enabled it should be enabled by default open the chrome developer tools on windows and linux press controlshifti on mac press commandoptioni select the observepoint panel use the tag debugger tag name  path this is the name observepoint uses to uniquely identify each vendor and tagging technology the path is the tag request up to the query string account this is the sitecatalyst report suite google analytics profile webtrends dcsid etc – within observepoint we call them accounts category observepoint’s classification of the kind of tag listed categories include analytics advertising tag management video voice of consumer split testing ecommerce and lead tracking for a complete list of all tags we support please visit our supported tag vendors status the network status code of the tag request most should be status  ok request  response size request is the amount of data sent to the vendor’s collection servers response is the data sent back to your web browser by the vendor total time  latency total time is measured from the initial request for the tag to time it is fully loaded latency is the time it takes from the initial request to the first response from the vendor detailed view of sitecatalyst showing a listing of each of the variables found as part of the tag can observepoint detect analytics tags that have been deployed multiple times on the same page yes find this in the duplicate or multiple requests report duplicate tags may be an indicator of data inflation does observepoint support both old and new versions of a tag most of the time yes but it depends on the tag for example we support hbx all the way to the current sitecatalyst tags typically if a tag has version data we will catalog it will observepoint audit pages that redirect yes we follow all redirects and will audit the terminal page if it is allowed by filters defined in the audit we also catalog all other server status codes such as broken and access denied pages can you see tags that are in an include file and not directly on the page yes one item that makes observepoint unique in this area is that we observe actual image request for a given tag can observepoint audit mobile websites for iphone ipad or android yes follow these steps to configure an audit to scan a mobile site access the mobile version of the site in your web browser and copy the url example httpsmobiletwittercomobservepoint paste the mobile url as the starting page of the audit change the audit user agent to a mobile browser note that this is only a user agent change the actual device that will be scanning the site does not change verify that the include filter will only audit mobile pages save which tag vendors do you support the observepoint tag database is constantly growing and being updated when i run an audit will it check iframes as well yes we will typically see tags loading from iframes without a problem we observe the network traffic for particular page tags that load from an iframe are part of the network requests how do i receive alerts on my phone most people simply use the email feature on their smartphone but we can send a text as well if you want us to send you a text instead follow these guidelines replace “phonenumber” with your own phone number area code first do not include dashes parentheses or spaces provider example alltel messagealltelcom att txtattnet boost mobile myboostmobilecom cellularone mobilecelloneusacom cricket smsmycricketcom omnipoint omnipointpcscom nextel messagingnextelcom qwest qwestmpcom sprint messagingsprintpcscom tmobile tmomailnet verizon vtextcom virgin mobile vmoblcom why should i use tag simulations we recommend setting page and tag alerts when you may have doubts concerning the reliability of page doubts for example could be triggered by a page impression report that shows a sudden drop in traffic even though the tagging audit shows complete tagging implementation our alerting functionality can also be used to record a process or form being filled out we can then replace this at a specified interval and alert you if the process breaks which ip addresses do you audit from this information is privileged and is available to observepoint customers only if you
