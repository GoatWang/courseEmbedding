about us investment philosophy performance letters  articles marketing materials video  pictures legal documents contact us we made the money that were investing by focusing our efforts on a few great ideas we run our fund in the same way we do more research than most firms our size and tend to hold our securities longer we have three main strategies that we rotate among putting the emphasis in areas where the market is most advantageous special situations where we identify mispriced assets and a catalyst to realizing value in those assets these opportunities tend to have a much higher rate of return than we can typically find in equities over a holding period that tends to range between  months and  years investments in wellrun undervalued companies we look for profitable high growth companies with significant operating margins and returns on invested capital these investments tend to be hard to find at the right price but when we do find them we may hold them for many years arbitrage where we seek out securities typically of a single company that are mispriced relative to one another in companies for which we have done substantial fundamental research these investments tend to have very high rates of return over a relatively short holding period usually less than  months with limited upside and limited risk of loss copyright    kg funds legal disclaimer powered by
