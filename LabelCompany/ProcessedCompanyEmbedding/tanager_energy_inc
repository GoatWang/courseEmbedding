management framework all of the possible risks associated with individual projectplatform as well as normal operations should be identified the focus in this step is on capturing and not necessarily evaluating the risks in addition the consequence of an incident risk occurring should be identified it is also important to note that there may be significant crossfunctional valueadded input from different individuals for example soliciting the input from project managers project leaders coordinators from host organizations specialist may provide valuable insightat a minimum the organization’s risk profile should address risks in the following risk classes strategic functional operational projectrelated and platformrelatedsome of the perils that threaten operations and assets and create risks include fire collision theft fraud security leaks violence climate and earthquakesfactors influencing risks should be identified they include acts of nature human inefficiency negligence error and willfulness and physical factors such as the availability and quality of materials and the state of a particular technologyeach risk should be identified as one that is either strictly internal to the tanager resource inc or partly or wholly related to the actions or omissions and property of other parties such as host organizations collaborators funding partners or suppliers either by design or by chance this distinction has important implications for determining the respective obligations or potential liabilities the degree of control that can be exercised over the probability of chance

to have significant longterm effects and potentially catastrophic shortterm effectsmedium – expected to have moderate impact the impact could be expected to have mediumterm detrimental effectslow – expected to have minor negative impact the damage would not be expected to have a longterm detrimental effectprobability can be described as follows high – the frequency of the event occurring is perceived to be once per hundred transactionsmedium – the frequency of the event occurring is perceived to be once per thousand transactionslow – the frequency of the event occurring is perceived to be once per ten thousand transactionsto simplify the analysis of the various risks it may be appropriate to group or classify the various by categories that would be considered appropriate by source or nature of risks for example scientific technology ethical for financialthe assessment of the impact and probability will result in a risk exposure index that will determine the extent of actions required the risk exposure index will also guide the prioritization of the identified risks other considerations in the prioritization could include the probability of detection and the possible timeframe within which this event may occurrisk exposure index actionvery high unacceptable – requires further mitigationhigh acceptable only with executive signoffmoderate acceptable with project
