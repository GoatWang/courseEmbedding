product generations significant evolutions can occur in both the customer needs a product must address and the technologies it employs to satisfy these needs furthermore even within a single development project firms must respond to new information or risk developing a product that is obsolete the day it is launched this paper examines the characteristics of an effective development process in one such environment  the internet software industry using data on  completed development projects we show that in this industry a more flexible approach to development is associated with better performing products this approach is characterized by the ability to generate and respond to new information for a longer proportion of a development cycle it is underpinned by greater investments in architectural design earlier feedback on product performance from the market and the use of a development team with extensive productbased experience our results further suggest that investments in architectural design must play a dual role in a flexible process first through the selection of an architecture which maximizes product performance and second through the adoption of an architecture which facilitates process flexibility we provide examples from our field work to support this view new product development  second edition book  edition published in  in english and held

refrigerator in general the devices had a large single electron charging energy ec is identical to sq e c of order  k by varying the ratio of ec to the josephson coupling energy ej we studied the crossover between the conventional josephson regime in which ejec and the coulomb blockade regime in which charging effects are dominant for comparable charging and josephson energies the iv curve is

the management of technological transitions  evidence from microsoft corporation by marco iansiti book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide many studies highlight the challenges facing incumbent firms in responding effectively to major technological transitions while some authors argue that these challenges can be overcome by firms possessing what have been called dynamic capabilities little work has described in detail the critical resources that these capabilities leverage or the processes through which these resources accumulate and evolve this paper explores these issues through an indepth exploratory case study of one firm that has demonstrated consistently strong performance in an industry that is highly dynamic

editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide there is considerable confusion among academics and practitioners over how or if information technology it impacts corporate performance can a typical company benefit from a focus on information technology to differentiate itself from competitors and achieve important business objectives our research has found this is indeed the case but that the answer is not found in a simple measure of the dollars invested in it in our study we wanted to focus on what it actually does for a business to accomplish this we developed an approach that measures the business capabilities it can enable our results show a high correlation between it capability and profitable business growth firms that build high capability it systems grow faster than firms that do not and do so while increasing both revenue and profits how the incumbent can win  managing technological transitions in the semiconductor industry by marco iansiti book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper reports on an empirical study of the management of technological transitions it focuses on projectlevel mechanisms for the generation of knowledge through experimentation and for its accumulation through individual experience it proposes a model that links these mechanisms to effectiveness in the management of revolutionary and evolutionary development approaches this argument is tested with data describing projects conducted by all major competitors in the semiconductor industry each project was aimed at a technological transition defined as the introduction of a major new generation of process technology the analysis shows substantial differences among competitors in the approach taken ie evolutionary vs revolutionary and results achieved additionally it shows that individual organizations can migrate over time from evolution to revolution and vice versa the analysis further indicates that accumulating experience and generating knowledge through experimentation are significantly associated with project performance while product performance improvement through revolution is associated with research experience and with parallel experimentation capacity improvement through evolution is associated with project experience and minimum experimental

source software oss what drives companies with large proprietary software portfolios to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in oss we approach this question by grouping a sample of oss projects

corporate playbook often becomes lost or muddled when the team takes the field to execute in their new book professor marco iansiti and microsofts steven sinofsky discuss a one strategy approach to aligning plan and action key concepts include the book combines practical experience at microsoft with conceptual frameworks on how to develop strategies that are aligned with execution in a rapidly changing competitive environment strategic integrity occurs when the strategy executes with the full aligned backing of the organization for maximum impact the chief impediment to strategy execution is inertia the one strategy approach is less about formal reviews and more about oneonone conversation blogs can be a powerful asset in managing an organization closed for comment  comments posted  jul  working paper summaries principles that matter sustaining software innovation from the client to the web by marco iansiti despite the current strength and promise of the internet software market the future pace of growth and innovation is not assured the principles of choice opportunity and interoperability were important in the growth of pc software and in the overall health of the information technology ecosystem and these same principles will shape competition in internet software according to hbs professor marco iansiti given the unprecedented speed at which this industry is developing consumers and the industry should watch carefully as different companies compete choice opportunity and interoperability should serve as an important lens particularly when focused on companies with especially large footprints in the new markets key concepts include successful technology companies should not forget that innovation and growth in the technology sector is dependent on promoting a thriving ecosystem of complementary and interdependent products the competitive principles of choice opportunity and interoperability are important in internet software because of the increased variety of possible software and hardware combinations and the increased interdependency in the applications and services they deliver closed for comment  comments posted  dec  working paper summaries dynamics of platform competition exploring the role of installed base platform quality and consumer expectations by feng zhu  marco iansiti what factors drive platform success longrun market structure and market efficiency conventional wisdom suggests that for a new platform to be successful either it must make its technology compatible with the incumbent or its technical advantage must offer so much value to consumers that it exceeds the combination of functionality installed base and complementary goods value offered by the incumbent zhu and iansiti develop a dynamic model to examine the evolution of platformbased markets they find that a huge quality advantage may not be necessary for an entrant to be successful using data from the video game industry they find support for their theoretical predications key concepts include a huge quality advantage may not be necessary for success when market dynamics are driven by quality a platform with a small quality advantage can also be successful xbox has a small quality advantage over playstation  and the market dynamics are quality driven these results help explain the successful entry of the xbox console into this market and provide support for zhu and iansitis theoretical model installedbase advantages do not necessarily provide a safety shield for the incumbent to defend its leadership position the incumbent needs to constantly enhance its quality closed for comment  comments posted  jan  research  ideas the business of free software by julia hanna breaking with a largely proprietary tradition large it

turning to the open source software community to create pieces of their products many it vendors invest in open source projects that draw customers to a vendors mainly proprietary core businesses—the

iansiti  gregory l richards ibm has contributed more than  billion to the development and promotion of the linux operating system and other vendors such as sun are ramping up open source software efforts and investment why do information technology vendors that have traditionally sold proprietary software invest millions of dollars in oss where have they chosen to invest and what are the characteristics of the oss projects to which they contribute this study grouped oss projects into clusters and identified it vendors motives in each cluster key concepts include cluster  the moneydriven cluster consisted of projects that have received almost all of vendor investments the eighteen projects in this cluster have received over  billion in investment cluster  the communitydriven cluster has a large number of projects that have received almost no vendor investment it vendors have generally ignored projects in this cluster and appear to have no coordinated strategy for dealing with them examining the impact of projects in both clusters shows that vendors have not invested uniformly in highimpact oss projects instead vendors invest in projects that can serve to draw revenues to their own largely proprietary core business closed for comment  comments posted  jul  working paper summaries why it matters in midsized firms by marco iansiti george

has also testified as an expert witness before the european commission and united states department of justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the hightech industry development of the field of ecosystem strategyedit iansiti helped develop the field of ecosystem strategy which focuses on the creation of firmlevel strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem iansiti built upon the previous work of james f moore the founder of the field of ecosystem strategy and is considered the current thought leader in the field iansiti examined firms such as microsoft corporation and walmart and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers suppliers and competitors many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of organizations technologies consumers and products perhaps the most dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry in contrast with the vertically integrated environment of the s and s today’s industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized products technologies and services the degree of interaction between firms in the industry is truly astounding with hundreds of organizations frequently involved in the design production distribution or implementation of even a single product and because of this increasingly distributed industry structure the focus of competition is shifting away from the management of internal resources to the management and influence of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the firm iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy including keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem this field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical contribution to understanding the role of information technology in modern businessesedit iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of information technology it strategy developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firmlevel investment in it iansitis work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between it investment and enterprise growth breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities it enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance this more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations level of it maturity referred to as the it scorecard this scorecard allowed the return on an organizations it investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously and provided a more actionoriented assessment that could be used for example to focus improvement efforts on underdeveloped it capabilities contribution to understanding the digital transformation of businessedit iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of technology strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation iansitis work in this

and execution every firm has two strategies unfortunately these strategies often diverge by sean silverthorne published jan     every firm has two strategies we learn early on in the pages of one strategy organization planning and decision making explicit strategy is the one you read about in your companys planning memos and powerpoint slides the second implicit strategy is what emerges when middle managers and line employees attempt to execute the explicit strategy unfortunately these strategies often diverge they are not aligned and so the potential of the enterprise becomes unrealized strategy therefore becomes the product of the firms incentives structures and patterns of behavior not the other way around writes harvard business school professor marco iansiti an expert on innovation entrepreneurship and operations marco iansiti is the david sarnoff professor of business administration at harvard business school this happened at computer maker dell says iansiti ossified in a deep culture of direct sales to corporate customers the company was slow to take advantage of a rapidly emerging consumer market—at least until founder michael dell returned to shake things upour past is littered with firms that failed to adapt to competitive changes iansiti says in an interview with hbs working knowledge obtaining one strategy in times of change means the organization will respond in a holistic fashion to new challenges staying aligned for maximum competitive impactthe book follows microsofts windows  development team headed by steven sinofsky as it encounters and overcomes many of these same challenges sinofskys blog posts to his team provide a behindthescenes look at how the one strategy approach works in practicesean silverthorne how did you get the idea for this bookmarco iansiti steven sinofsky and i have known each other for more than  years and have often worked together on projects such as cases and articles after spending over a decade with the microsoft office team steven was asked to manage windows development in may  as windows vista development was winding down during his time with windows steven wrote over  pages of blogs to communicate with his team this provided an incredible wealth of information from which to draw and synthesize what we now believe are some pretty interesting insights the book combines a selection of stevens blogs with practical conceptual frameworks on how to develop strategies that are aligned with execution in a rapidly changing competitive environmentq who will benefit from reading ita our audience is senior managers in any industry specialists in the hightech sector will find it particularly interesting because it reflects on crucial competitive dynamics in their space however managers outside the tech sector will still appreciate the general management lessons throughout the bookq what is strategic integrity and why is it importanta every firm has two strategies the first is topdown directed strategy—what the ceo and the senior management team believe the firm should focus on the second is bottomup emergent strategy which is established by the actual decisions and behaviors in the organizationdirected strategy is what management believes needs to get done while emergent strategy represents what actually gets done strategic integrity is when emergent and directed strategies are one and the same thing when the strategy executes with the full aligned backing of the organization for maximum impact when a strategy lacks integrity its like those war movie spoofs when the cavalry general goes on the attack only to find that none of his troops actually follow himthe book provides a very pragmatic and detailed look at how to achieve strategic integrity this is not a theory book but a book that offers insights and tools one can put into practice steven and i describe in detail how to build organizational capabilities set up a good structure implement the right processes and adopt an effective management styleachieving strategic integrity is always important since managers naturally wish to maximize the impact of their strategies however the notion of strategic integrity is particularly important in times of change our past is littered with firms that failed to adapt to competitive changes obtaining one strategy in times of change means the organization will respond in a holistic fashion to new challenges staying aligned for maximum competitive impactq what are the chief impediments to strategy executiona the chief impediment is inertia over time organizations tend to optimize the efficiency of their operating model dells direct model during the  time frame is the perfect example every process every incentive every cultural norm was optimized to deliver efficiently bypassing the retail channel when the strategy changed the organization simply did not follow execution continued along the old inertial path and the organization failed to adapt despite the intentions of senior management the structures processes and behaviors defined in the book are designed to break inertia and maintain strategic alignment in times of changeq to plan or not to plan your own research sheds some light on the question of whether topdown project planning has become outdated in todays fastmoving environments what did you discover and how did microsoft do ita planning is key planning is the glue that holds the organization together providing a way to test the strategy determine its feasibility improve it through collective feedback and align capabilities to drive its executionplanning is central to the one strategy approach but the planning process we describe is going to surprise many executives its not the usual topdown rigid budgetstyle race for resources or a brain trust—driven process developed by a select set of the top peopleplanning for one strategy is iterative and collaborative defining a framework for executing on the strategic priorities while refining the strategy and aligning the organization around its features planning is the process that more than any other activity works to align the organization around one set of goals topdown bottomup and middleout by necessity planning is a process that involves many people and empowers those closest to the knowledge and the work q one thing that struck me in steven sinofskys blog was how relatively little of his time was devoted to formal product reviews going in i would have bet that these kinds of meetings would be huge at microsoft what did you make of this practicea in a review the middle managers typically deliver a powerpoint presentation that formalizes issues around project status to the executive in charge of the project this makes no sense if you truly believe that the point is aligning the whole organization around the strategy not convincing the one executive that you are following his or her ideasthe one strategy approach is less about formal reviews and more about oneonone conversation the idea is to maintain as much as possible a rich twoway and informal exchange of ideas to make sure that the strategy is perfected and the priorities are universally shared there is no point in spending days preparing slides that portray an oftenartificial look at the project to convince your manager that you understand his or her views the point is for everyone to contribute to perfect the approach and do so in a collaborative fashion and with integrity beautiful handcrafted slides dont cut it what you want is free informal discussion around the realities of the projectq the one strategy approach is mirrored in your discussion of the innovators reality the reality is that in designing new products innovators cant ignore the benefits users received from previous versions how should companies think of existing products when it comes to creating new onesa answering this question goes back to our definition of innovation innovation is invention times impact invention is nice but if it has no economic or social impact it is uselessthis view on innovation highlights the interesting role played by established firms traditionally my academic field has argued that big companies have trouble innovating because their businesses are too complex with assets processes and capabilities that make the organization inflexible however those same assets are also extremely valuable when it comes to achieving impact established enterprises have customer relationships channels to market technical capabilities critical data and information about consumers along with a myriad other factors that will increase the impact of any innovation they come up with apple microsoft google and ibm are all established firms each with a remarkable track record of innovations that built on past capabilitiesthe same assets processes and capabilities that make established firms complex and hard to manage also make them incredibly powerful and impactful the innovators reality is that in order for a product to be successful it has to master the complexity of customer adoption—and customers are used to the richness of previous versions and traditional solutions the first successful hybrid cars for instance had to have air bags just like their predecessors this means that established firms start with a huge advantage in that they have already mastered answers to these problems rather than being helpless when confronted by startups established firms should leverage their traditional capabilities and manage their way to success—as long as they can figure out how to get the organization aligned around the new strategiesq one way that sinofsky communicates with his staff is via a quite detailed blog on his management philosophy what did you think of this idea and is it a model that other managers should followa blogs are a powerful asset in managing an organization if you are responsible for hundreds or thousands of people ensuring clear consistent communication of your ideas to the entire group is a difficult challenge as steven demonstrates blogs are highly effective in aligning an organization jumpstarting a twoway interaction that can really shape strategy and align the organization around itblogging today is increasingly common in an informal poll in the schools general management program which brings in executives from around the world about  percent said they write a regular blogq care to comment on toyota which is held up as a model at the end of the book but which has since suffered very public problems i wonder if its admitted overemphasis on growth at the expense of quality might be an example of the dangers of separating strategy development from strategy executiona the toyota story becomes more interesting every day there is no question that decades of success at toyota demonstrate the power of its management systems and approaches at the same time the roots of its current crisis appear very deepit is difficult to understand exactly what happened since the questions have barely started but it seems quite possible that toyotas model may have ossified a bit as what happened with the dell example we discuss in chapter  some of the accounts that i have seen point to an inability by management to detect longterm patterns across different recallswhether the organization was still aligned in both the strategic importance of quality and in the execution of a quality strategy might have contributed to the situation we see today clearly many questions remainq what are you working on nowa the main thing i am working on is a generalization of the one strategy framework by running an empirical study across four industries namely online services foods

software innovation from the client to the web marco iansiti economic analysis often reviews the role of principles—such as respect for intellectual property rights—in driving innovation given the interdependent nature of innovation in information technology three core principles have emerged that work together to ensure that complementary interconnected products coexist and compete these core principles are particularly important when applied to platforms which have played a central role in enabling the development and distribution of the variety of applications and services that drive the popularity of software the first principle focuses on enabling choice firms should allow consumers and partners to have a real choice between complementary products and services from otherwise competing firms eg a browser should enable a consumer to choose a home page provided by a competitor the second principle focuses on opportunity specifically opportunity that is facilitated by giving developers platform access and the ability to innovate and build on platform technologies to create new products and services the third principle focuses on interoperability vendors should enable products to work together so customers can realize the full benefit of complementary products offered by competing vendors following this principle enables products to connect to each other in appropriately defined ways and ensures that users can port their data between products securely and reliably this paper reviews the rationale for these principles and examines their impact on

a platformbased market finally when is a platformbased market socially efficient we analyze a dynamic model where an entrant with superior quality competes with an incumbent platform and examine longrun market outcomes we find that the answers to these questions depend critically on two parameters the strength of indirect network effects and consumers discount factor of future applications in addition contrary to the popular belief that indirect network effects protect incumbents and are the source of market inefficiency we find that under certain conditions indirect network effects could enhance entrants quality advantage and market outcomes hence could be more efficient with stronger indirect network effects we empirically examine the competition between the xbox and playstation  consoles we find that xbox has a small quality advantage over playstation  in addition the strength of indirect network effects and consumers discount factor in this market are within the range in which platform success is driven by quality advantage and the market is potentially efficient counterfactual experiments suggest that playstation  could have driven xbox out of the market had the strength of indirect network effects more than doubled or had consumers discount factor increased by fifty percent keywords price network effects market platforms monopoly quality competitive
