investors borrowers news contact us home about us investors borrowers news contact us investors “kimura seeks to achieve performance consistent with the return and risk patterns of a diversified portfolio of commodity trade finance transactions” kristofer tremaine cio kimura commodity trade finance investment objective we focus on transaction based lending to small and mediumsized enterprises smes credit is assessed and secured against the counterparty andor the underlying product being financed as opposed to the traditional bank business of balance sheet assessment and unsecured lending commodity trade finance the most fundamental issue in international trade finance is the method of payment agreed between importer and exporter the exporter wants to accelerate payment from the importer and the importer wants to delay and mitigate the supply risk from the exporter trade finance bridges the finance gap and settles the conflicting needs of the importer and exporter commodity trade finance has grown faster than other syndicated financings due to development of free trade policies growing investment and consumption needs in developing countries increase in volumes traded growing demand for secured assets due to change in risk appetite by banks regulatory framework and constraints on liquidity commodity trade finance low interest rates market uncertainty and disappointment with passive investments such as long only commodity funds have left investors seeking alternative sources of return   commodity trade finance has historically been a profitable function of banks but regulatory changes and balance sheet restructuring following the financial crisis of  has meant that many banks have been forced to scale back this lending business this has made trade finance significantly harder to access particular for smaller producers and traders which has led to increased demand for alternative source of finance however despite these structural changes the risk profile at a transaction level remains unchanged which has led to a new opportunity for investors kimura aims to package this return profile into a new category of asset class by introducing an alternative return profile we interest investors seeking attractive riskadjusted returns low volatility scalability asset diversification absolute returns uncorrelated exposures low minimum investment transparency convenience and cost efficiency the flexibility of quarterly liquidity investment process we employ an active investment approach by selecting high quality commodity trade finance transactions across strategic commodities energy metals and softs   we seek to deploy funding across the supply chain spectrum from producer processorrefiner to distributormerchant trader loans are mostly secured against the underlying commodity with additional recourse to the borrower’s balance sheet   kimura is able to finance any number of senior and junior debt structures as well as configurations of structured debt kimura will consider transactions globally with an initial focus on europe cis africa and asia and under no circumstance will review transactions involving us sanctioned countries kimura adopts a stringent client onboarding process due diligence is at the centre of the company’s operational mandate a thorough review process is conducted on each new counterparty and on every transaction   although defaults within trade finance are already very low our investment committee aims to mitigate this further by only investing in commodities regions counterparties and transactions that satisfy very strict risk and credit parameters furthermore since we take a portfolio approach across many separate and uncorrelated transactions the risk to overall investor return from possible default in any individual transaction is diversified significantly   transaction default rate for shortterm trade finance  source international chamber of commerce  global risks trade finance report constructing the portfolio  maintain and develop an extensive database of trade finance counterparties covering multiple commodities regions and deal types  identify transactions and counterparties that offer the best risk adjusted exposures  pass selected transactions and counterparties through rigorous credit and commercial due diligence procedures  select only transactions which offer superior risk and return  characteristics  credit is agreed on a noncommitted basis and lending is performed on a transaction by transaction basis  treasury structuring and risk functions are managed for the lifetime of each transaction  transactions are self liquidating and funds including profits and fees are returned to the fund benefits of investing in kimura global diversification access to commodity trade finance riskreturn profiles quarterly liquidity with no long dated lockups or other liquidity constraints no heavily weighted individual
