employee relations are also out mobility analytics and other it initiatives helped push american consistently ahead of rivals united and continental in customer satisfaction but ford a cio hall of fame member says his most lasting accomplishment is how he developed his staff you joined american airlines in  after the  terrorist attacks youre leaving as us involvement in the war in iraq draws down theres been a recession or two in between and the airlines are everyones favorite industry to hate has it been a wild ridea decade ago we talked about all the things we needed to do at american and how sept  had a devastating effect but we were still going to do these things we were trying to integrate twa which was pretty big sabre was selling its it business to eds monte fordnot that im the best leader ever but the people we were able to assemble really met the challenges we came from a place where we had lost our technology leadership and outsourced our thinking to a place where were thought leaders now mobility networking backend systems  these things set us up to support the customer of the future through these tumultuous years how did you get the money to pay for all the it you useevery year we gave ourselves a challenge to selffund the new things we needed to do by taking whatever million from operating expenses in the last two years we had the lowest operating expenses weve ever had some people when money gets tight will back off on innovation because theyre hunkered down we had the opposite philosophy thats the time you need to spend most on innovation everyone was okay with that we developed relationships with the business units that gave us the credibility to make these decisions if youre constantly justifying your existence you are in less good position to do your work initially it was can we even come to strategy meetings now were doing presentations in those meetings what is your most lasting accomplishment at americanthe development of people the focus has to be not on looking back but forward back is not where innovation and creativity come from always move people forward i like to rotate people into different areas so theyre not getting stale take a really good person and the second they create a highperforming team is when you take them and put them somewhere else and let them do it again and one of those high performers steps up and leads that team its my turn to rotate every really good leader should know when its time to step aside most cios stay in the job for four years ive been here  its time what do you wish youd known about leadership  years agoi wish i knew as much about how to develop people as i do today but the only way to know that is to do it how you reward people makes a difference in it weve always paid people what they deserve to be paid even in difficult times salary is a statementbut how you treat them recognize them and promote diversity in the workplace all matter diversity is not just how many men or women or hispanics and african americans its how open you are to suggestions from people who dont have your background your successor is maya leibman who has worked at american

selfservice kiosks into the business units shes a very smart and very talented individual with a great personality maya has a different style than i do but philosophically we agreewhats next  teaching consulting another cio rolei think i have opportunities in all of those i want to live so that i create a void when i leave i want there to be a hole in the planet where i was a cio like me at a big company has a higher calling not only as a matter of integrity and how you live your life but how you treat people and manage in times of need a cio like me is supposed create an environment where innovation comes first im supposed to find and pick small young companies when guys like me are willing to go with a different provider or a new technology or take a chance those staid it companies function better and later produce better products the innovation i want to promote is not just at american but across the it industry what do you think your last day will be likeim going to spend that day with maya talk with her about all the things shes done encourage her embolden her its going to be a very very sad day for me but im sure maya and i will share a few laughs and hugs then i will
