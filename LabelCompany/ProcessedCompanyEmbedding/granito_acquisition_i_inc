thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in top underwriters virtual data rooms five simple steps to totally mess up your merger’s virtual data room and blow the deal posted on august     comment ok the headline is a bit dramatic – but when discussing virtual data rooms vdr a little overacting is appropriate to emphasize the importance of “shopping” for a vdr it’s a very wide product market – ranging from inexpensive limited functionality dropndrag box cloud folders to extremely powerful aggressive priced document management systems our vdr’s intelligent value meets the requirements of most ma transactions – especially for middle market companies request a demonstration step  don’t plan or… planning is vital for every activity in business and setting up a virtual data room is no different by creating detailed plans of action you can avoid being caught unprepared for any situations arising from the index structure you need to fulfill the requirements of the deal methods of adding and removing user permissions ways of managing queries using the qa options controlling the quality of service provided to stakeholders finalization of the deal closure of the data room and backing up of the information if you overlook these aspects you’ll find yourself having to scramble to meet the objectives of your data room step   don’t bother understanding the costs or… virtual data room pricing depends on a number of variables including the level of service you choose cheaper doesn’t always mean better so make sure you understand exactly what your pricing covers for example if your documentation consists mainly of many pages of text then pricing per megabyte could be more practical than a price per page data containing highresolution images require more space to store so a price per page could be a better option in that case other factors that affect pricing include the scanning and uploading of data as well as the number of users that require access if you do the prep work yourself you’re likely to pay less than you would if the service provider managed the process—as long as you do it right step  not fussing with permissions or… providing access to your data is a sensitive issue and one that can backfire badly if you get it wrong user permissions determine what various parties in the deal are able to view copy print and download so don’t leave this critical aspect in the hands of a junior staff member the permission structure is ideally created during the planning stage and requires the knowledge and experience of a qualified deal coordinator to avoid errors make sure you understand who is getting what access and why and ask questions to clarify any points you are unsure about step  don’t think of asking for help or… nobody expects you to be an expert in managing a virtual data room especially not your first time around there’s a reason why you choose a service provider carefully and even if you’re determined to do your own prep work and manage the process yourself don’t avoid asking for help when you need it if you’re using a service provider that offers a full coordination service it can help you to prevent unpleasant surprises and leverage the technology available to make the best decisions for the deal our recommendation if possible always use a deal coordinator who will be able to ensure you don’t make these mistakes this will result in effective management and a good experience step  cheaper the better or… not all virtual data room providers are created equal and if you want the service you need it’s critical to make sure you choose a vendor who is able to deliver before you appoint a provider find out whether the company has the resources to offer a full service or if any aspects will be outsourced if so you’ll need to pay close attention to issues such as security processing times and the integration across different platforms even if your provider manages everything inhouse it’s important to understand the security protocols in place and the document protection options that are available to you your choice of provider can affect the success of your deal and the integrity of your information significantly request a demonstration have a great day share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin  comment posted in virtual data rooms ipos and transactions august  –  posted on august

the new  ipo study from proskauer rose llp is a must read for those of us in the capital markets business of working with ipos click here to download the study the report examines in great detail the jobs act financial profiles and accounting disclosures sec comments and timing corporate governance ipo expenses deal structure lockups sponsorbacked companies most relevant to vintage are  the jobs act and the findings regarding emerging growth companies egc confidential ipos vs traditional ipos and of course  ipo expenses but i will add a third point the merging of those two as shown in the proskauer rose llp with added magnifying glass chart below generally the lionshare of our s work is with egcs our intelligent value fee structure has always appealed to micro and smallcap companies however it was enlightening to read exactly how intelligent our value can be a  delta savings is a lot of intelligent value for any size ipo it’s over th of the total cost of the entire ipo process for an egc click here to download the s workflow illustrated whitepaper from the wall street journal what proskauer found was that on average the reported expense of going public as an emerging growth company was  million last year versus  million for nonegcs this could be partly explained by the fact that nonegcs tend to be bigger companies no says proskauer’s frank lopez cohead of the capital markets practice while he couldn’t pinpoint the reasons he explained that “larger companies expenses can be just as simple but just generating more money roi” implying that costs should be pretty standard across all deals yes cost should be standard across all deals pinpointing the reasons for financial printing cost control is easy as there are only a few meaningful variables accuracy of typesetting is not not not a variable the s is either accurate or not and not is not an option or upgrade the sec comments and revisions process can be a variable but no direct trend was found in the report other than some sectors seem to have more comments than other sectors physical printing is a variable with large highprofile ipos needing paper ink and postage the last variable to highlight is that many ipos are handed an “overabundance” of rush charges from rush changes vintage clients fortunately don’t face that we have always believed that “rush” is inherent within the s registration process – and not an addon billable cost it is the job click here to learn more about our capital markets services have a nice day share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin  comment posted in ipo vintage upgrades flexbrl program streamlines corporate reporting promotes investor adoption of sec filings posted on august    leave a comment two new enhancements focus on industrywide drive for xbrl data quality   new york august   pr newswire  — vintage the capital markets and corporate solutions division of pr newswire today announced they have upgraded their xbrl extensible business reporting language program flexbrl with two new features further demonstrating vintage’s position as the industry’s intelligent value xbrl online review xor xor is a secure xbrl review portal that enables all reviewers of an sec reporting company’s xbrl filing process to collaboratively review and comment on xbrl tagging selections before final submission to the sec built with an intuitive online interface xor delivers a complete set of userfriendly features that allow xbrl reviewers to navigate and communicate effortlessly through xbrl instance documents streamlining the workflow for finance counsel csuite auditors and vintage to thoroughly review the xbrl documents together including xbrl calculations checking within the xor viewer uses icons to clearly highlight extension tags negated elements calculation errors and more threaded commenting allows members of the internal financial reporting team as well as permissioned outside auditors to add comments to xbrl documents for quality assurance verification of instance documents and the approval – or disapproval – of bookmark tags and facts comprehensive reporting of calculations extensions negations and units with an xbrl filing as well as comparing differences between two xbrl versions taxonomy searching provides simple navigation filtering and reviewing options xor will be especially useful to vintage flexbrl core clients who are not currently working in vintage’s comprehensive xbrl saas platform online interactive analyst center iac vintage has partnered with virtua research to allow flexbrl clients to publish their financial fundamental information onto their investor relations website with data directly from their own official sec xbrl files this eliminates the concerns issuers have long held regarding the inaccuracies of manually collected thirdparty financial fundamental data and delivering that unvetted data to investors for investors and analysts the interactive analyst center makes company financial data – balance sheet income statement and cash flow data – more readily accessible and easier to understand online “the issue of xbrl quality created an roi ‘chicken  egg’ scenario in the capital markets” said liam power president of vintage “many corporate issuers have expressed concerns regarding their experience with xbrl because neither investors – nor the sec itself – were using the data meanwhile investors have equally expressed their concerns as the xbrl data was inconsistent across the market today’s announcement drives both quality and adoption this is especially important in light of the sec’s recent disclosure that they are taking a much more aggressive tone towards enforcing xbrl data quality” continued power “the common goal for everyone involved is uniform usable data that connects issuer and investor” both xor and iac are available to all vintage xbrl clients at no additional cost and are included in all new compliance packages for detailed information  httpwwwthevintagegroupcomcontactus  about vintage vintage a pr newswire division is a topthree provider of fullservice regulatory compliance and shareholder communications services

the intelligent value for public companies posted on august     comments the feedback we received from clients partners and other stakeholders regarding the relaunch of vintage was affirming we have become the industry’s intelligent value depending on whom you ask here we’re either the honda of xbrl the target store of ir services or the jetblue  southwest of ipo transactions what is intelligent value for a vintage client it’s the flexibility to receive a superior service at the appropriate scale to their business goal and what is that appropriate scale  that’s for a client to decide but generally it is the venn middle of costeffective and intrinsicimportance   case examples an otc marketslisted company is a sec reporting organization they are doing all they can to be transparent while finding new investors unfortunately the fee quoted for xbrl from an oldschool financial printer seems “aggressive” and will drain an inordinate percentage of budget for the size of the issuer – reducing their overall budget for shareholder communications wisely above cost the issuer is equally concerned about quality and don’t want to switch to an “xbrl garage band” vendor nor a new untried firm our flexbrl core solution delivers their intelligent value bonus they also find additional intelligent value by negotiating a bundle that includes shareholder communications news distribution and their ir website  with the xbrl a nasdaqlisted midcap is going to issue more shares they need to draft and file a new s registration with the sec but as they have been public for quite a while the registration is not as “passionate” as their ipo it’s just paperwork the s working group is very small and don’t require to meet facetoface they don’t need the indulgence of a mahogany conference room they do need accurate typesetting a  virtual transaction delivers intelligent value bonus fortunately for them they are an existing pr newswire client which gives them a buying power boost each day more examples are being created the bottomline for all these clients and prospects is be creative and precise with what you require to receive as intelligent value address your business goals don’t buy more than you need but certainly don’t settle for less are we the kleenex of edgar i can’t answer that really but we are the  largest filer have a great day share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin
