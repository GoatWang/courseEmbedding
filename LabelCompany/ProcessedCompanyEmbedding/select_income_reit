the huntsville al property is occupied by a subtenant that continues to pay rent to sir in an amount equal to the rent under the rejected lease the sublease term runs concurrently with the former

calculated in accordance with gaap plus real estate depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of real estate assets and the difference between net income and ffo allocated to noncontrolling interest as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to sir sir’s calculation of normalized ffo attributed to sir differs from nareit’s definition of ffo because sir includes business management incentive fees if any only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with gaap due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of sir’s core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year and sir excludes acquisition related costs expensed under gaap loss on asset impairment and normalized ffo from noncontrolling interest net of ffo if any sir considers ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a reit along with net income net income attributed to a reit and operating income sir believes that ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts such as depreciation expense ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir may facilitate a comparison of its operating performance between periods and with other reits ffo attributed to

hanover pa with approximately  rentable square feet and an original lease term until september  the huntsville al property is occupied by a subtenant that continues to pay rent to sir in an amount equal to the rent under the rejected lease the sublease term runs concurrently with the former tenant’s original lease term subject to certain termination rights by the subtenant sir expects that the

distributions declared per common share                  sir calculates ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir as shown above ffo attributed to sir is calculated on the basis defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit which is net income calculated in accordance with gaap plus real estate depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of real estate assets and the difference between net income and ffo allocated to noncontrolling interest as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to sir sir’s calculation of normalized ffo attributed to sir differs from nareit’s definition of ffo because sir includes business management incentive fees if any only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with gaap due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of sir’s core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year and sir excludes acquisition related costs expensed under gaap loss on asset impairment and normalized ffo from noncontrolling interest net of ffo if any sir considers ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a reit along with net income net income attributed to a reit and operating income sir believes that ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts such as depreciation expense ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir may facilitate a comparison of its operating performance between periods and with other reits ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir are among the factors considered by sir’s board of trustees when determining the amount of distributions to sir’s shareholders other factors include but are not limited to requirements to maintain sir’s qualification for taxation as a reit limitations in sir’s credit agreement and public debt covenants the availability to sir of debt and equity capital sir’s expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance and sir’s expected needs and availability of cash to pay its obligations ffo attributed to sir and normalized ffo attributed to sir do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income net income attributed to sir or operating income as an indicator of sir’s operating performance or as a measure of sir’s liquidity these measures should be considered in conjunction with net income net income attributed to sir and operating income as presented in sir’s condensed consolidated statements of income other real estate companies and reits may calculate ffo and normalized ffo differently than sir does  incentive fees under sir’s business management agreement with the rmr group llc are payable after the end of each calendar year are calculated based on common share total return as defined and are included in general and administrative expenses in sir’s condensed consolidated statements of income in calculating net income in accordance with gaap sir recognizes estimated business management incentive fee expense if any in the first second and third quarters although sir recognizes this expense if any in the first second and third quarters for purposes of calculating net income sir does not include such expense in the calculation of normalized ffo attributed to sir until the fourth quarter when the amount of the business management incentive fee expense for the calendar year if any is determined normalized ffo attributed to sir excludes estimated business management incentive fee expense of  for the three
