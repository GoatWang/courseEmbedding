of plaintiff’s competitors carlyle global financial services partners lp “carlyle” the background facts underlying this case are not in dispute plaintiff eig is an asset manager that specializes in raising and investing funds in the area of energy and energy infrastructure defendant the tcw group inc “tcw” manages investment products and defendant tamco is a subsidiary of tcw cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   prior to  eig’s principals and several of its employees operated as a subgroup within tcw that focused on energy and infrastructure investments in  eig’s principals and tcw agreed to permit eig’s principals to leave tcw and establish a new business this new business took the form of a cooperative venture under which eig would continue managing funds already operated by the eig principals raise new funds and distribute payments to tcw from the funds the process through which eig and tcw accomplished this goal was governed by an “omnibus agreement” see vitale decl ex b this agreement provided that the separation between eig and tcw would occur in three phases as the phases progressed different amounts of the revenue generated by the funds were allocated between tcw and eig and control over the funds would be gradually transferred to eig specifically those funds launched during phase  were operated through tcw those launched during phase  were operated through a limited liability company operated by eig and tamco and those launched during phase  were operated by eig  on the same day the parties entered into the omnibus agreement tamco and eig entered into an ancillary agreement governing the operation of the joint venture to be formed between eig and tamco after the above phases were commenced see vitale decl ex a “llc agreement” the llc agreement was attached as an exhibit to the omnibus agreement pursuant to the omnibus agreement this joint venture took the form of an llc named tcw  eig alternative investments llc referred to hereafter as “the llc” jointly owned by tamco and eig the llc proceeded to act as a general partner for energy fund xv a fund focused on energy investments  pursuant to the omnibus agreement phase  began on october   and ended when the parties executed their first “new product launch” which appears to be energy fund xv omnibus agreement recital  the precise date this launch occurred is unclear from the parties submissions phase  began immediately when phase  ended and though the parties initially planned in the omnibus agreement to end phase  on december   the parties later agreed to end phase  on december   see omnibus agreement recital  stern decl ¶  phase  then commenced on january   and is set to end january   omnibus agreement recital  cv  civil

energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   in august  societe generale announced its plans to sell its controlling interest in tcw to investment funds controlled by carlyle “the carlyle transaction” carlyle like eig manages funds that focus on private energy investments seeking to prevent this sale eig initiated arbitration on august   through the los angeles office of judicial arbitration  mediations services pursuant to the omnibus agreement and llc agreement see section iva below as of august   an arbitrator had not been selected and eig filed the motion for a preliminary injunction now before the court iii legal standard a preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy” winter v natural res def council inc  us    “a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief that the balance of equities tips in his favor and that an injunction is in the public interest” am trucking ass’n inc v city of los angeles  fd   th cir  see also cal pharms ass’n v maxwell jolly  fd   th cir  alternatively “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction assuming the other two elements of the winter test are also met” alliance for the wild rockies v cottrell  fd   th cir  a “serious question” is one on which the movant “has a fair chance of success on the merits” sierra online inc v phoenix software inc  fd   th cir  under either formulation demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm is “most critical” nken v holder  us    iv analysis a injunctions preserving the status quo pending arbitration are permissible district courts have the authority to grant a preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo pending arbitration toyo tire holdings of amercias inc v continental tire north america inc  fd   th cir  as the ninth circuit has cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   recognized such injunctions can be necessary to insure “the meaningfulness of the arbitration process” and therefore further the congress’s policy in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements id other circuits are in agreement see id at  –  collecting cases additionally the ninth circuit in toyo tire explained that preliminary relief in this context is particularly important because “one party to the arbitration often has an incentive to delay arbitration proceedings to its own advantage” and “even without bad faith by either party the selection of arbitrators and the constitution of the arbitral panel necessarily takes time” id at  here the arbitration agreements specifically provides that the parties may seek a preliminary injunction under these circumstances specifically the llc agreement and omnibus agreement both provide that the parties may seek “provisional injunctive relief    in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator” llc agreement §  omnibus agreement §  therefore this court has authority to issue an injunction that remains in effect until final resolution of this matter in arbitration provided that plaintiff establishes that there are grounds for granting injunctive relief toyo tire  fd at  the court next turns to those grounds b whether plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits this case is essentially a contract dispute that hinges on the construction of two agreements the omnibus agreement and the llc agreement according to plaintiff the sale of tcw is barred by §  of the llc agreement which states in relevant part “no membership interest of portion thereof can be transferred without the consent of a supermajority of the board of directors” llc agreement §  plaintiff further points out that the term “transfer” is explicitly defined in the llc agreement to mean “a sale exchange transfer assignment including through the transfer of control by means of the transfer of voting stock or other equity interest of a membership interest” llc agreement appendix  §  plaintiff argues that the portion of this definition referring to “voting stock or other equity interest” makes clear that §  prohibits transactions in equity that would result in a change in control of tamco which holds a membership interest in the llc cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   plaintiff contends that the accuracy of this reading of §  is confirmed by the sole exception under which a party to the llc agreement can transfer its interest without the consent of a supermajority of the board pursuant to §  a membership interest can be transferred without consent to a “member’s whollyowned subsidiary so long as    such subsidiary remains whollyowned by such member” plaintiff infers that because the only excepted transfer is one in which a membership interest remains in the hands of an entity wholly controlled by a member a transaction that changes which entity exercises ultimate control over the entity holding the membership interest is barred plaintiff concludes that because §  prohibits a transfer of control of tamco without the consent of a supermajority of the llc’s board of directors the proposed acquisition by carlyle violates §  plaintiff contends that a change of control will take place for the simple reason that prior to the transaction societe generale ultimately controlled tamco but after the transaction carlyle will ultimately control tamco moreover plaintiff explains that the llc’s board has not consented to the sale and that tamco could not obtain consent if it tried because eig selects a majority of the board plaintiff further argues that its interpretation reasonably construes §  in a manner consistent with the way that courts interpret priorconsent and firstrefusal clauses in agreements governing closely held business ventures as plaintiff points out the delaware court of chancery has explained antiassignment clauses are normally included in contracts to prevent the introduction of a stranger into the contracting parties relationship and to assure performance by the original contracting parties    in some business relationships the continued personal involvement of an original contracting party is a material premise of the contract itself in such cases any assignment is problematic in other cases the parties fear that the assignee will either not perform or will perform inadequately in which case what is problematic is not the assignment per se but the identity of the assignee star cellular telephone co inc v baton rouge cgsa inc  del j corp l   del ch  though the delaware court of chancery in star cellular ultimately cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   found that a merger challenged by the plaintiffs in that case did not effect a transfer because it did not change the identity of the company or managers who exercised ultimate control over plaintiffs’ business partners see id at  in this case plaintiff argues that the proposed sale would change ultimate control over tamco in violation of the purpose of antiassignment clauses such as §  see also in re asian yard partners  wl  at  –  interpreting an antitransfer provision in partnership agreement to “encompass a situation where there is a transfer of a controlling interest in a partner entity because such a transaction effectively transfers a partner interest to the control of the party acquiring the controlling interest of the partner entity” oregon rsa no  inc v castle rock cellular of oregon ltd partnership  fsupp   –  d oregon  finding that an agreement that prevented an entity from transferring its interest in a partnership also prevented the sale of that entity where the entity’s only significant asset was the partnership interest plaintiff recognizes that tamco is the only defendant that signed the llc  agreement but argues that the other defendants can nonetheless be enjoined from taking any steps to complete the proposed acquisition by carlyle plaintiff offers two arguments in support of this conclusion first plaintiff argues that tamco had actual and apparent authority to bind tcw because all defendants signed the omnibus agreement which contained the complete text of the llc agreement and stated that it would be executed omnibus agreement § a plaintiff concludes that tcw therefore authorized tamco to impose upon it the obligations in the llc agreement see also omnibus agreement §  “the tcw parties agree not to take and agree not to permit any of their respective affiliates to take any action intended to circumvent diminish or impair the economic governance or other rights of the other parties and under this agreement”  plaintiff also notes that even if these other entities were not liable for breaches of the llc agreement and hence were not subject to a

can be enjoined from violating §  of the llc agreement on the theory that their actions directly caused tamco to breach §  plaintiff explains that while corporate parents are not generally liable for the actions of their subsidiaries a corporate parent is liable when it uses its ownership of a subsidiary to make the subsidiary commit an unlawful act see esmark inc v nlrb  fd   th cir  following kingston dry dock co v lake champlain transp co  fd   d cir  l hand j  in response defendants argue that §  of the llc agreement cannot prevent societe generale from selling its stake in tcw because the omnibus agreement contains no provision preventing the sale and under §  of the llc agreement any inconsistency between the two agreements is resolved by looking to the omnibus agreement moreover defendants argue that §  of the omnibus agreement demonstrates that the proposed sale of tcw to carlyle can go forward without eig’s consent specifically defendants point to the portion of §  that provides if    tcw group or any of its controlled affiliates is a party to any transaction whereby tcw group or any of its controlled affiliates acquires merges with is acquired by or becomes affiliated with any party active in the energy or infrastructure business with products that compete directly or indirectly with eig’s products offered as of the date of this agreement    then eig may as its sole and exclusive remedy accelerate the operational and personnel transition to eig that is scheduled to occur in the phase  period omnibus agreement §  defendants contend that the omnibus agreement specifically contemplates the possibility that tcw will be acquired by an eig competitor and specifies that in those circumstances eig’s “sole and exclusive remedy” is to “accelerate the operational and personnel transition scheduled to occur in the phase  plaintiff also argues that even if tcw is not liable for a breach of the llc agreement it could still practically be prevented from consummating the sale because the injunction would prevent them from conspiring with or aiding and abetting tamco’s violation of the injunction cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman

company et al date november    period” defendants conclude that because the omnibus agreement controls in the event of any inconsistency between it and the llc agreement this provision prevents plaintiff from seeking an injunction barring the sale of tcw without approval of a supermajority of the joint venture’s board additionally defendants argue that even if the llc agreement were controlling that agreement does not prohibit the sale of tcw without the consent of a supermajority of the board according to defendants §  of the llc agreement only applies to transfers of a membership interest by a “member” to a third party defendants therefore conclude that because tamco will be the entity holding the membership interest before and after the sale of tcw to carlyle no transfer will occur and the sale will not violate §  buttressing its interpretation of §  defendant points to case law that has found that a change in corporate control of a partner in a joint venture does not thereby introduce a new party to the business venture in northeast communications of wisconsin inc v centurytel inc  fd  th cir  the seventh circuit considered whether a partnership agreement giving the partners in a joint venture a right of first refusal pertaining to transfers of partnership interests became activated when the parent of one of the entities holding a partnership interest underwent a merger id at  –  plaintiff argued that the merger of defendant’s parent with another corporation triggered the right of first refusal because it effectively introduced a stranger into the business venture id at  rejecting this argument the seventh circuit reasoned the merger accomplished no such thing because “a new indirect owner may give universal new marching orders but so may a new ceo of a partner that has no corporate parent and a change of ceo or a new business plan adopted by an old ceo does not give other partners a buyout right” id see also engel v teleprompter corp  fd   –  finding that no transfer of stock held by a subsidiary occurred through the sale of the subsidiary’s corporate parent because direct ownership of the stock by the subsidiary was not altered in the

conclusion that any transfer of the stock of any entity that possesses an interest in cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   tamco requires eig consent defendants claim that this result is a necessary consequence of plaintiff’s interpretation because §  applies to the transfer of any portion of a membership interest and presumably the transfer of any portion of the equity of a company that controls tamco would in turn amount to a transfer of a portion of the membership interest held by tamco second defendants argue that under plaintiff’s construction of §  no third party could obtain a controlling interest in societe generale without eig’s consent defendants contend that it would be absurd to read the llc agreement to contain such a broad restraint on alienation binding complete strangers to the llc agreement third defendants argue that the bargaining history and conduct of the parties shows that it would be absurd to find that a critical term in their overall relationship is “buried” in an appendix to the llc agreement instead defendants argue if the parties intended to restrict societe generale’s ability to sell its interest in tcw it would have made more sense to include that restriction in an agreement signed by societe generale in reply plaintiff argues that there is no inconsistency between the omnibus agreement and the llc agreement insofar as the llc agreement merely contains an additional restriction on transfers in control that is not present in the omnibus agreement additionally plaintiff argues that §  of the omnibus agreement and §  llc agreement do not conflict because they address different concerns plaintiff explains that §  of the omnibus agreement addresses the consequences that follow when tcw becomes a competitor of eig whereas §  focuses on any change in control over tcw finally plaintiff argues that exclusive remedy portion of §  of the omnibus agreement does not limit plaintiff’s remedies in this case because it only applies if the parties have not already reached phase  of their relationship since the parties agree that phase  has already commenced plaintiff concludes that this clause does not limit its ability to seek this injunction the court finds plaintiff’s construction of the agreements more convincing and therefore finds that plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits the plain terms of the llc agreement require the consent of a supermajority of the board before control over a membership interest is transferred “by means of the transfer of voting stock or other equity interest” llc agreement appendix  §  the parties agree that consent of a supermajority of the llc’s board has not been obtained and because the carlyle sale cv  civil minutes  general

v tcw asset management company et al date november   would transfer control over tamco from societe generale to carlyle the carlyle sale is prohibited by the plain terms of the llc agreement  other courts have construed antitransfer provisions similarly even when those provisions do not explicitly define “transfer” to include changes in control affected by transfers of voting stock or other equity in oregon rsa no  for example the plaintiff sued to exercise a right of first refusal to purchase a partnership interest when the defendants did not purchase the partnership interest itself but instead purchased the entities that held the partnership interest oregon rsa no   f supp at  since the parties’ contract only explicitly applied to “tranfers” of partnership interests and not transfers of the entities holding partnership interests the district court was faced with the question whether a partnership interest was effectively transferred through a sale of the entities which held that partnership interest id at  the court found that a transfer did occur under these circumstances and that any other result would circumvent the purpose of the rightoffirst refusal clause id at  in re asian yard partners  wl  d del br ct  is similarly instructive there the debtor took the position that its sale of the stock of an entity holding a partnership interest did not violate a provision barring any partnership interest transfer “directly or indirectly or by operation of law” because that entity would still be the direct holder of the partnership interest before and after the stock sale id at  the bankruptcy court disagreed finding that “a transfer of control of a corporate general partner is prohibited as an indirect transfer of a general partner interest” id at  the court’s interpretation of the llc agreement does not render it irretrievably inconsistent with the omnibus agreement as plaintiff points out there is no  since the court relies on the definition of “transfer” set out in the appendix of the llc agreement which specifically contemplates that transfers can occur through transfer of voting stock or other equity engel and centurytel do not compel a different result the agreements in those cases contained no comparable provision giving “transfer” such a broad definition see centurytel inc  fd at  –  setting out the transfer restriction agreement

california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   inconsistency between the agreements by virtue of the fact that the llc agreement contains restrictions on transfers of control that are not contained in the omnibus agreement in fact it is natural to expect that the two agreements would place substantially different restrictions on the relationships between the parties because the agreements have entirely different purposes the omnibus agreement addresses the overall relationship between the parties including the formation and capitalization of the llc whereas the llc agreement addresses the management and operation of the llc therefore there is nothing inconsistent or surprising about the fact that the llc agreement contains restrictions on the transfer of ultimate control over the llc that have no correlate in the omnibus agreement  additionally this interpretation of the llc agreement does not entail absurd results the court rejects defendants’ argument that plaintiff’s interpretation compels the result that any transfer of societe generale or tcw’s stock requires eig consent plaintiff’s position is consistent with the position that transfers of a minority of the equity interest in the direct or indirect owners of tamco do not amount to a transfer of all of the equity interest of a membership interest here plaintiff is arguing that total transfer of control over tamco results in a full transfer of the membership interest held by tamco and that argument does not entail that a transfer of a minority ownership interest in societe generale would somehow be a transfer of a small portion of tamco’s membership interest the court also rejects defendants’ argument that it is absurd to find that a term in the appendix of the llc agreement has the farreaching consequence of preventing the carlyle transaction   additionally the court agrees with plaintiff that the “sole and exclusive remedy” clause of §  of the omnibus agreement accelerating the omnibus agreement to phase  does not limit plaintiff’s remedies to acceleration to phase  because the parties have already entered phase  nothing in §  suggests that plaintiff should be deprived of any remedy for the events mentioned in that section in the event that the parties already entered phase   in a supplemental filing defendants argue that eig’s principles blair thomas and randall wade acted inconsistently with eig’s position in this litigation by transferring their equity interests in eig to trusts without consent of tamco’s board cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   although an injunction restraining tamco alone would likely suffice to prevent the sale and as a practical matter preserve the status quo pending arbitration plaintiff is also likely to succeed in proving that the other tcw defendants are liable for any breach of the llc agreement caused by tamco first the omnibus agreement specifically provides that “the tcw parties agree not to take and agree not to permit any of their respective affiliates to take any action intended to circumvent diminish or impair the economic governance or other rights of the other parties and under this agreement” omnibus agreement §  since the omnibus agreement provided that tamco and eig were to enter the llc agreement and the llc agreement was attached to the omnibus agreement this provision prevents tcw from taking any action that would impair eig’s governance rights under the llc agreement second as tamco’s parent tcw faces liability for any breach of the llc agreement by tamco because “a parent corporation may be held liable for the wrongdoing of a subsidiary where the parent directly participated in the subsidiary’s unlawful actions” esmark inc v nlrb  fd   th cir  if tcw takes action through tamco that violates the llc agreement it therefore faces liability for breach of the llc agreement for these reasons the court finds that plaintiff has a strong likelihood of success on the merits as against both tcw and tamco and thereby effected an upstream transfer of a membership interest in violation of §  as plaintiff points out in reply this is course of performance evidence and hence cannot be relied upon because the court finds §  unambiguous on its face in any event there is no inconsistency between eig’s litigation position and the actions of thomas and wade here eig’s litigation position is that §  prevents upstream transfers that lead to a change in control of the entities that control tamco and the transfers by thomas and wade to the trusts did not lead to a change in control over eig see second supplemental thomas decl ¶  “i have and at all times have had full control over the exercise of any and all voting or other governance rights with respect to the trust’s ownership interests in eig” wade decl ¶  “i have and at all times

management company et al date november   c plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the sale is executed plaintiff argues that it is facing irreparable harm as a matter of law as explained above plaintiff likely has a right under §  of the llc agreement to prevent a transfer of tamco’s membership interests without the consent of a board supermajority and plaintiff argues that if the sale of tcw proceeds it will irretrievably lose that right plaintiff claims that settled authority recognizes that the loss of this type of right – the bargained for right to prevent business transactions resulting in substantial change in corporate structure or business relationships – necessarily results in irreparable harm see cdc group plc v cogentrix energy inc  f supp d   sdny  empresas cablevision sab de cv v jp morgan chase bank na  f supp d   sd ny  alternatively plaintiff argues that that it will suffer irreparable harm because the transaction will allow carlyle to obtain sensitive eig information to exercise management control over the joint venture will result in marketplace confusion and will render plaintiff unable to make certain types of investments in response defendants argue that the harm plaintiff claims to suffer is too speculative to warrant granting an injunction moreover defendants argue that plaintiff’s concerns about its confidential information are misplaced because the omnibus agreement provides protection for confidential eig information in this context additionally citing to vantico holdings sa v apollo management lp  f supp d  sd ny  defendants claim that the court should not presume that plaintiff will suffer harm from any managerial control carlyle might exercise over tamco because there is no evidence that carlyle and its agents would ignore their fiduciary duties and economic self interest by sabotaging the joint venture the court finds that plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the acquisition goes forward in apparent violation of the llc agreement because complex business transactions cannot be simply unwound bargained for rights to prevent changes in business structure and ownership are irreversibly lost after a transaction breaching those rights occurs this principle is illustrated well in empresas cablevision sab de cv  f supp d at  there the plaintiff sued to enjoin defendants’

one of plaintiff’s competitors id at  plaintiff argued that this sale was barred by a provision that gave plaintiff the right to veto any assignment of the loan by defendant id the district court found that plaintiff faced irreparable harm because defendants’ planned sale would “emasculate plaintiff’s right to veto assignments of the loan and this sort of injury is irreparable as a matter of law” id at  the court further explained that “when a party has expressly negotiated for and received the right to veto certain transactions with which it disagreed before those transactions commenced a right that is irretrievably lost upon breach and may not be compensable by nonspeculative damages the only way to render such a provision truly viable is to enforce it” id following wisdom import sales co v labatt brewing company  fd   d cir  internal quotation marks omitted here plaintiff is asserting a right to prevent a transfer in the control of tamco its partner in a cooperative venture without supermajority approval if this right is not given interim protection it will be lost once the announced acquisition of tcw is consummated this result would interfere with the arbitration process and leave plaintiff without a meaningful remedy should it succeed on the merits consequently the court finds that plaintiff is likely to face irreparable harm if it is not granted preliminary relief d the balance of the equities tips in plaintiff’s favor as explained above plaintiff faces irreparable harm from the irretrievable loss of its right to influence who controls tamco’s membership interest in the llc defendants argue that balance of equities nonetheless tips in defendants’ favor because a temporary injunction would create a serious risk that the sale to carlyle would collapse the collapse of the sale would in turn harm tcw through “negative consequences to the  since the court’s decision is that the type of injury plaintiff faces constitutes irreparable harm as a matter of

will result from the temporary injunction while defendants speculate that the injunction itself would cause the sale to carlyle to collapse there is no showing that this result is certain and no showing that a comparably beneficial transaction would be impossible were it to prevail in arbitration therefore since plaintiff faces irreparable harm that cannot be undone if it prevails in arbitration the balance of the equities tips in plaintiff’s favor  the analysis reached here is akin to the district court’s reasoning in cdc group plc v cogentrix energy inc  f supp d   sdny  in that case the plaintiff a minority shareholder in a joint venture with the defendant sought to enjoin the defendant from selling its shares in the joint venture pursuant to an anti transfer provision id at  balancing the equities the district court found that a preliminary injunction preventing defendant from selling its shares would cause minimal harm reasoning that while the injunction could deprive the defendants of one chance to sell their shares there was no evidence that the defendants would not be able to arrange a comparable sale if it prevailed at trial id at  in contrast the district court found that the plaintiff faced greater harm because if it prevailed at trial but defendants had already sold their shares defendants “could not readily be brought back into a forced ownership position without incalculable disruption” id e the public interest favors granting an injunction district courts are required to weigh the public interest implicated by an injunction stormans inc v selecky  fd   th cir  however “when the reach of an injunction is narrow limited only to the parties and has no impact on non parties the public interest will be at most a neutral factor in the analysis rather than one  in fact the evidence suggests that carlyle and tcw knew that eig planned to challenge the sale to carlyle and hence that any delay caused by a temporary injunction could have been anticipated and should not cause the transaction to collapse see supplemental thomas decl ¶¶  –  cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united

granting or denying the preliminary injunction” id this case is a contract dispute that does not implicate any broad public interest beyond the signatories to the contracts and their close business associates although the proposed injunction in this case affects the rights of nonparties societe generale and carlyle the impact of the injunction is limited to these private parties and does not implicate the public interest accordingly since the other factors weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction and because a preliminary injunction ensures that the parties receive a meaningful arbitration this factor does not preclude granting an injunction  f proper scope of the injunction the preceding analysis demonstrates that a preliminary injunction should be granted to preserve eig’s right to prevent transfers of control over tamco’s membership interest in the llc pending the completion of the arbitration and the court now considers how to structure a narrowly tailored injunction that protects eig’s contractual rights but places no unnecessary burdens on defendants’ interest in closing the carlyle transaction califano v yamasaki  us    “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs” the parties have suggested different forms that such an injunction could take plaintiff proposes that the court issue an injunction preventing the tcw parties from closing the carlyle transaction and taking certain preliminary steps necessary to close the transaction plaintiff maintains that preventing the carlyle transaction from taking place is the only way to insure that no transfer of control over the membership interest takes place defendants propose a far narrower injunction they propose that the injunction take a form analogous to a “hold separate” order which is commonly issued in antitrust  the parties also submitted numerous evidentiary objections the court does not rely on the evidence to which objections are asserted instead as is apparent from the text of the order the court’s decision rests on its interpretation of the language of the omnibus agreement and llc agreement and its finding that irreparable harm has been shown absent the issuance of an injunction accordingly these objections are hereby overruled as moot cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document

business or investment decisions of the llc a graphic representation of the effect of defendants’ proposed injunction is plaintiff argues that in this case unlike roche a hold separate order is not sufficient to protect its rights under the llc agreement and omnibus agreement plaintiff claims that it has the right to be in a joint venture relationship with tamco while that entity is cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   controlled by tcw and ultimately societe generale and that forcing it to accept any other arrangement is a violation of its contractual rights plaintiff also argues that defendants’ proposed injunction would violate the terms of the llc agreement because while the agreement allows tamco to transfer the membership interest downstream to an entity it controls the agreement does not allow it to transfer control over the membership interest upstream to an entity that controls tamco the court finds that defendants’ proposed hold separate injunction adequately protects plaintiff’s right to obtain full relief under the llc agreement and omnibus agreement plaintiff is guaranteed that control over the membership interest will not pass from tamco which in turn is controlled by societe generale these agreements do not however entitle plaintiff to any rights with respect to other assets held by tamco or any other tcw entity hypothetically the tcw entities and societe generale could spinoff all tcw assets except the membership interest into a new company as set forth in the below hypothetical transaction and this transaction would be wholly consistent with plaintiff’s rights as long as tamco was still the holder of the membership interest and no upstream change in control over tamco occurred plaintiff would have no interest in the assets held by the new company pursuant to the llc agreement and omnibus agreement consequently control over this new company and its assets could change and no violation of plaintiff’s rights would occur no violation of plaintiff’s rights would occur in this hypothetical spinoff and sale a graphic representation of this hypothetical transaction is  at oral argument counsel for plaintiff argued that the hypothetical transaction would violate plaintiff’s rights if in the course of spinning off tamco’s other assets tamco also changed its employees and managers plaintiff’s counsel further argued that defendants’ proposed transfer of the membership interest to a trust would lead to such a change in employees and management in violation of plaintiff’s rights the court disagrees nothing in the llc or omnibus agreements gives eig control over which individuals may act as the employees or managers of tamco while counsel for plaintiff argues that a change of management could cause such a change in the structure of tamco to be equivalent to a change of control this argument ignores that as the parent corporation societe generale could change tamco’s management without there being any breach of the llc or omnibus agreements cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   what the hypothetical transaction illustrates is that the llc agreement and omnibus agreement only give plaintiff a right to prevent transactions that have an effect on control over the membership interest held by tamco a transaction can radically change other tcw assets and other aspects of the corporate structure of tcw entities without violating plaintiff’s rights as long as ultimate control over the membership interest remains unaltered plaintiff’s rights have not been violated it follows that defendants’ proposed injunction is sufficient to secure the remedy to which plaintiff would be entitled if it succeeds in arbitration the hypothetical cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman document  filed  page  of  page id  united states district court central district of california civil minutes  general case no title cv  cas manx eig global energy partners llc v tcw asset management company et al date november   transaction is equivalent to defendants’ proposal for purposes of the llc and omnibus agreements and because plaintiffs’ rights are not violated in the hypothetical transaction they are not violated under defendants’ proposal either this is the case because in the corporate structure that results from defendants’ proposed injunction ultimate control over the membership interest remains in the hands of societe generale even though all other assets held by tcw entities have been transferred by separating the membership interest from other carlyle assets this remedy preserves plaintiff’s interest in preventing changes in control over the membership interest pending the completion of the arbitration but by leaving all other aspects of the carlyle transaction intact it reaches no further therefore defendants’ proposed form of injunction will ensure that plaintiff has the remedy to which it is entitled if it prevails in arbitration and it is far more narrowly tailored to achieve this result while not interfering with defendants’ ability to proceed to close the transaction as to matters that do not implicate plaintiff’s rights all that defendants’ proposed injunction accomplishes is placing the membership interest in a trust which effectively holds this interest separate from the rest of the transaction pending a ruling by the arbitrator consequently the court finds that defendants’ form of injunction should issue   defendants’ proposal in some ways does not function as a true hold separate order because it is not structured to allow plaintiff to unwind the carlyle transaction a typical hold separate order prevents intermingling and change of control in order to insure that a transaction can be unwound in this case however plaintiff would have no right to unwind the transaction but only has a right to block changes in control over the membership interest therefore the hold separate order in this case does not need to preserve unwinding or divestment of ownership as a remedy it only needs to prevent transfer of control preservation of divestment of ownership as a remedy may be a necessary feature of a hold separate order in the antitrust context but it is not necessary here cv  civil minutes  general page  of  case cvcasman
