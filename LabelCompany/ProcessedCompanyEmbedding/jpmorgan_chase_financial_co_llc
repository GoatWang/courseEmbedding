hypothetical payments at maturity on the notes at maturity for a subset of index returns detailed in the table above  to  your investment may result in a loss of up to  of your principal amount at maturity     how the notes work   upside scenario if the final value is greater than the initial value investors will receive at maturity the  principal amount plus a return equal to two times the index return up to the maximum return of  at maturity under the terms of the notes an investor will realize the maximum payment at maturity at a final value of  or more of the initial value   ●   if the closing level of the index increases  investors will receive at maturity a  return or  per  principal amount note   ●   if the closing level of the index increases  investors will receive at maturity a return equal to the maximum return of  or  per  principal amount note which is the maximum payment at maturity par scenario if the final value is equal to the initial value or is less than the initial value by up to the buffer amount of  investors will receive at maturity the principal amount of their notes downside scenario if the final value is less than the initial value by more than the buffer amount of  investors will lose  of the principal amount of their notes for every  that the final value is less than the initial value by more than the buffer amount   ●   for example if the closing level of the index declines  investors will lose  of their principal amount and receive only  per  principal amount note at maturity the hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term  these hypotheticals do not reflect the fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market if these fees and expenses were included the hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments shown above would likely be lower selected risk considerations   an investment in the notes involves significant risks these risks are explained in more detail in the risk factors sections of the accompanying product supplement and underlying supplement   ●   your investment in the notes may result in a loss  the notes do not guarantee any return of principal if the final value is less than the initial value by more than  you will lose  of the principal amount of your notes for every  that the final value is less than the initial value by more than  accordingly you may lose up to  of your principal amount at maturity   ●   your maximum gain on the notes is limited to the maximum return regardless of the appreciation in the index which may be significant     ps    structured investments   capped buffered return enhanced notes linked to the russell  ® index      ●   credit risks of jpmorgan financial and jpmorgan chase  co  investors are dependent on our and jpmorgan chase  cos ability to pay all amounts due on the notes any actual or potential change in our or jpmorgan chase  cos creditworthiness or credit spreads as determined by the market for taking that credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes if we and jpmorgan chase  co were to default on our payment obligations you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment   ●   as a finance subsidiary jpmorgan financial has no independent operations and has limited assets  as a finance subsidiary of jpmorgan chase  co we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our securities aside from the initial capital contribution from jpmorgan chase  co substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under loans made by us or other intercompany agreements as a result we are dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations under the notes if these affiliates do not make payments to us and we fail to make payments on the notes you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by jpmorgan chase  co and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of jpmorgan chase  co   ●   potential conflicts  we and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the notes in performing these duties our and jpmorgan chase  cos economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes it is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines please refer to risk factors  risks relating to conflicts of interest in the accompanying product supplement   ●   the notes do not pay interest   ●   you will not receive dividends on the securities included in the index or have any rights with respect to those securities   ●   an investment in the notes is subject to risks associated with small capitalization stocks  small capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic market trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies small capitalization companies are less likely to pay dividends on their stocks and the presence of a dividend payment could be a factor that limits downward stock price pressure under adverse market conditions   ●   lack of liquidity  the notes will not be listed on any securities exchange accordingly the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price if any at which jpms is willing to buy the notes you may not be able to sell your notes the notes are not designed to be shortterm trading instruments accordingly you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity   ●   the estimated value of the notes is lower than the original issue price price to public of the notes  the estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors the original issue price of the notes exceeds the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes these costs include the selling commissions the projected profits if any that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes see the estimated value of the notes in this pricing supplement   ●   the estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others estimates  see the estimated value of the notes in this pricing supplement   ●   the estimated value of the notes is derived by reference to an internal funding rate  the internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes is based on among other things our and our affiliates view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixedrate debt of jpmorgan chase  co the use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes see the estimated value of the notes in this pricing supplement     ps    structured investments   capped buffered return enhanced notes linked to the russell  ® index      ●   the value of the notes as published by jpms and which may be reflected on customer account statements may be higher than the thencurrent estimated value of the notes for a limited time period  we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by jpms in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period see secondary market prices of the notes in this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period accordingly the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by jpms and which may be shown on your customer account statements   ●   secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes  any secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because among other things secondary market prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and also because secondary market prices a exclude selling commissions and b may exclude projected hedging profits if any and estimated hedging costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes as a result the price if any at which jpms will be willing to buy the notes from you in secondary market transactions if at all is likely to be lower than the original issue price any sale by you prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you   ●   secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors  the secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors which may either offset or magnify each other aside from the selling commissions projected hedging profits if any estimated hedging costs and the level of the index additionally independent pricing vendors andor third party brokerdealers may publish a price for the notes which may also be reflected on customer account statements this price may be different higher or lower than the price of the notes if any at which jpms may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market see risk factors  risks relating to the estimated value and secondary market prices of the notes  secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors in the accompanying product supplement     ps    structured investments   capped buffered return enhanced notes linked to the russell  ® index      the index   the russell  ® index consists of the middle  companies included in the russell e tm index and as a result of the index calculation methodology consists of the smallest  companies included in the russell  ® index the russell  ® index is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the us equity market for additional information about the russell  ® index see equity index descriptions  the russell indices in the accompanying underlying supplement historical information the following graph sets forth the historical performance of the index based on the weekly historical closing levels of the index from january   through june   the closing level of the index on june   was  we obtained the closing levels above and below from the bloomberg professional ® service bloomberg without independent verification the historical closing levels of the index should not be taken as an indication of future performance and no assurance can be given as to the closing level of the index on the observation date there can be no assurance that the performance of the index will result in the return of any of your principal amount in excess of  per  principal amount note subject to the credit risk of jpmorgan financial as issuer of the notes and the credit risk of jpmorgan chase  co as guarantor of the notes   tax treatment   you should review carefully the section entitled material us federal income tax consequences in the accompanying product supplement no i the following discussion when read in combination with that section constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel davis polk  wardwell llp regarding the material us federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of notes based on current market conditions in the opinion of our special tax counsel it is reasonable to treat the notes as open transactions that are not debt instruments for us federal income tax purposes as more fully described in material us federal income tax consequencestax consequences to us holdersnotes treated as open transactions that are not debt instruments in the accompanying product supplement assuming this treatment is respected the gain or loss on your notes should be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the issue price however the irs or a court may not respect this treatment in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected in addition in  treasury and the irs released a notice requesting comments on the us federal income tax treatment of prepaid forward contracts and similar instruments the notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment it also asks for comments on a number of related topics including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked the degree if any to which income including any mandated accruals realized by nonus investors should be subject to withholding tax and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the constructive ownership regime which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain longterm capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge while the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates     ps    structured investments   capped buffered return enhanced notes linked to the russell  ® index      any treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes possibly with retroactive effect you should consult your tax adviser regarding the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice withholding under legislation commonly referred to as fatca may if the notes are recharacterized as debt instruments apply to amounts treated as interest paid with respect to the notes under a recent irs notice withholding under fatca will not apply to payments of gross proceeds other than any amount treated as interest of a taxable disposition including redemption at maturity of the notes you should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of fatca to the notes nonus holders should also note that recently promulgated treasury regulations imposing a withholding tax on certain dividend equivalents under certain equity linked instruments will not apply to the notes the estimated value of the notes   the estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components  a fixedincome debt component with the same maturity as the notes valued using the internal funding rate described below and  the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes the estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which jpms would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market if any exists at any time the internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes is based on among other things our and our affiliates view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for our conventional fixedrate debt of jpmorgan chase  co for additional information see selected risk considerations  the estimated value of the notes is derived by reference to an internal funding rate in this pricing supplement the value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates these models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs some of which are marketobservable and which can include volatility dividend rates interest rates and other factors as well as assumptions about future market events andor environments accordingly the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time the estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others estimates different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes in addition market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect on future dates the value of the notes could change significantly based on among other things changes in market conditions our or jpmorgan chase  cos creditworthiness interest rate movements and other relevant factors which may impact the price if any at which jpms would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions the estimated value of the notes is lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes these costs include the selling commissions paid to jpms and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers the projected profits if any that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected or it may result in a loss a portion of the profits if any realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits if any see selected risk considerations  the estimated value of the notes is lower than the

repurchases of your notes by jpms in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period these costs can include projected hedging profits if any and in some circumstances
