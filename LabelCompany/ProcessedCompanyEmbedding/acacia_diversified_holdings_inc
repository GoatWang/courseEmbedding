acacia diversified holdings welcome to please take a few minutes to navigate through our site review our history and our plans thank you for visiting and we hope you will come again about our name a·ca·cia – pronounced uhkay’shuh we are proud of our company and its plan for doing business and wanted to select a name that would portray the right image to our clients the acacia tree embodies that image and has become the symbol of the great symbiosis that can occur between a company and its clients one of the world’s most valued trees the acacia tree is found in many parts of the world including the united states the wood of the acacia is very hard and an excellent building material in their native habitats some of them become huge forest trees over  feet tall with trunks four feet in diameter often protected by strong thorns some of these huge acacias provide beautiful hardwood lumber for furniture cabinets boats musical instruments and ornamental purposestaking a high polish acacia wood often exudes a pleasant fragrance the natural plant gums found in acacia are used as thickening agents and emulsifiers in food products cosmetics and pharmaceuticals these gums produce the thick rich consistency of sauces and syrups prevent the formation of ice crystals in frozen desserts and stabilize the foaming in beer many common candies and jelly beans contain a thickening agent called gum arabic gum acacia from the sap of certain acacia trees this gum can be found in candies from such wellknown vendors as mentos dreyers and starburst and can even be found in ben and jerry’s ice cream the acacia tree is looked upon as the “tree of life” in many parts of the world some insects and animals protect the tree from its predators while the tree provides them with nourishment in exchange this symbiosis is seen as a parallel to our company’s determination to serve its clients we will seek to protect and nourish one another in building relationships that are impenetrable in

approximately  as of december   in june  the company completed a private placement offering of its common stock raising just over  and caused to be formed acacia augusta vehicle auction inc a south carolina corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the company “aava” for the sole purposes of acquiring certain assets of the augusta auto auction and operating an auction at that same location this became the company’s first operating asset in the automotive auction industry and was the company’s only revenue producing business at that time in late  after successfully operating the augusta auction for more than four years the company determined that it was in its best interests to sell the augusta auction and the sale transaction was completed on july   following the disposition of the augusta vehicle auction the company sought to become a diversified holding company the company was without revenueproducing operations from july   until july   in october of  the company changed its name to acacia diversified holdings inc to reflect its determination to diversify its business interests the company’s business operations from mid through mid were conducted through two new  whollyowned subsidiaries and an operation that was not yet segregated as a subsidiary or division they included citrus extracts inc acacia transport services inc and acacia milling services a brief description of each follows on july   the company formed a whollyowned subsidiary named citrus extracts inc cei in fort pierce florida which became a foodgrade byproducts manufacturer cei was a business in the food manufacturing industry subsector that transformed livestock and agricultural products into products for intermediate or final consumption cei utilized our proprietary chemicalfree  natural processes in the manufacturing sale and distribution of allnatural foodgrade ingredients from raw fresh natural citrus peel resulting from citrus juicing operations through these controlled methods cei processed and dehydrated orange lemon grapefruit and tangerine peel into its “citrablend” and “citrablend organic” products and then milled those products to varying sizes ranging from larger “cut  sift flakes” to  mesh powders or smaller sizes for custom orders those ingredients both organic and nonorganic found their way into many regional and national brandname products commonly found on america’s kitchen tables in the form of spices teas and otherwise our citrablend products were also utilized in brewing many local and regional craft beers in addition to nationallyrecognized beer brands and because we had only begun address that market it remained largely untapped at that time citrablend was primarily sold through a network of distributors who blended our products and sold them as ingredients included in many wellknown consumer products in march of  the company began milling products as acacia milling services in conjunction with its citrus extracts manufacturing operations acacia milling services “ams” was a developmental stage business in the milling or grinding industry that milled finished citrus ingredient products rendered by citrus extracts into smaller finer particles those milling services varied from simple sifting operations that separated the various sizes of materials to creating specific cuts from the original material such as “tea bag cut” size granulated materials of various sizes or “powders” of various mesh sizes generally the greater the mesh size higher mesh sizes referred to finer smaller particle size requested by the customer the higher the milling charges per pound the company also intended to expand its offerings of those milling services to outside parties for the generation of additional revenues but sold the business prior to doing so in july and august of  the company through its new whollyowned acacia transport services inc subsidiary acquired a fleet of tractors and trailers and became engaged in the transport business in july of  the company formed a new subsidiary named acacia transport services inc ats for the primary purpose of hauling raw citrus peel from the lambeth groves juice company in vero beach florida to its citrus extracts manufacturing facility and hauling excess peel to local farmers for use as livestock feed ats operated three tandem axle road tractors five  foot aluminum enddump peel trailers one  foot van trailer and a straight truck with stainless steel tank to accommodate those operations on june   the company sold the assets and related business of its citrus extracts inc and acacia transport services inc subsidiaries the details of that transaction can be found by clicking on the link to the current report on form k filed on july   on the sec page of this website on january   the company acquired the assets and related businesses of the marij group of companies in clearwater florida consisting of marij agricultural inc jr cannabis industries llc cannacures research  development center llc and tripiflora llc the company created two new subsidiaries to become its new revenueproducing operations marij pharmaceuticals inc with current operations and cannacures research  development center inc anticipated to commence operations following the companys anticipated capitalraising activities set for commencement in midmay of  a description of each subsidiary follows marij pharmaceuticals inc marij’s impetus will be in the extraction and processing of very high quality highcbdlowthc content medical grade cannabis oils from medical cannabis plants marij specializes in organic strains of the plant setting itself apart from the general producers of nonorganic products in addition marij has the technical expertise and capability to process and formulate the oils and to employ them in its compounding operations marij will seek to become engaged as owner or coowner of a grow facility in florida or other locations such as to produce its own plants for processing marij has also been preparing for the  rollout of its newlydeveloped proprietary geotraking technology that is fully compliant with the health insurance portability and accountability standard “hipaa” utilizing its “plant to patient” solution this geotraking technology is designed to provide a fullchannel patient care tracking system that is fully compliant under today’s strict hipaa regulations that require privacy and security of the patient’s information beginning with rfid labeling and tracking of every single seed employed in the grow program and continuing through the sale of prescription products in a sophisticated retail pos delivery system the geotraking technology will be the most advanced system available marij’s revenues are anticipated to be generated from several activities including but not limited to the following a cannabis oil extraction and processing marij has a unique mobile cannabis oil processing and extraction unit designed into a heavyduty vehicle that unit has already begun performing extractions and processing of medical organic hemp into oils at various sites and is currently developing additional contracts for services b wholesale sale of raw and processed low or zerothc medical cannabis oils c laboratory testing and certification services marij has begun construction of a mobile laboratory and testing unit also on a heavyduty truck chassis intended to address the growing demand for these services in the medical cannabis industry d licensing and support of the company’s geotraking technology systems e processing and compounding services for medical grade cannabis oils the company is preparing to seek additional investments and financing to pay the costs of building its second mobile oil extraction and processing unit to finance final construction of its mobile laboratory and testing unit for the same industry and to complete the rollout of its geotraking technology system there can be no assurance the company will be successful in its plans to generate the required capital cannacures research and development center inc while this subsidiary has not yet implemented revenueproducing operations it is anticipated to begin generating revenues after mid those revenues will be generated from several activities including the following a cannacures will seek to enter into research and development projects with institutions of higher learning in efforts to develop new and better strains of medical cannabis related products for dispensing as medications nutraceuticals cosmeceuticals and probably dietary supplements cannacures anticipates participating in state and federal grants in conjunction with one or more universities as a means to defray part of its costs in these efforts b private label packaging services the company has obtained a majority of the equipment required to engage in the business of packaging and labeling of medical cannabis oils oilinfused products and related items c retail sales of medical cannabis oils oilinfused products and other merchandise through its webbased portal or retail dispensaries planned for that purpose these activities are dependent in large part upon meeting fda regulations and criteria relating to the sale and distribution of cannabisinfused products and the company is currently in the process of determining the status of those criteria d retail and wholesale sales of cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and dietary supplements containing its highquality cannabis oil extracts again dependent upon the same fda regulations and criteria as mentioned in item c above the company will require additional capital to finalize these plans and accommodate the rollout of its services for this subsidiary and intends to begin its capital raising activities through an offering of its common stock and convertible debentures in midmay  jr cannabis industries llc the third entity acquired in the transactions of january   was jr cannabis industries llc that entity was a service business providing management services in coordination with the activities of marij agricultural following the acquisition of those entities acacia determined that it no longer needed services the same or similar to those of jr cannabis industries and therefore has elected to not recreate it as a subsidiary of the company tropiflora llc the fourth and final entity acquired in the transactions of january   was tropiflora llc in the acquisition transactions of january   the company acquired the noncapital assets and the business of tropiflora llc but not its goodwill or capital assets as a part of its efforts to engage in growing cannabis in florida through a growers license prior to tropiflora’s acquisition by marij and ultimately by acacia it was a grower with decades of experience in the nursery industry with the capacity to grow large quantities of plants marij and subsequently acacia acquired the business of tropiflora to position itself to be issued a growers license under the new  florida cannabis laws if successful in obtaining a florida growers license tropiflora as an acacia subsidiary would cultivate and distribute legal medical cannabis products in the state opening the door to the sale of the noneuphoric strains of cannabis to treat patients with seizure disorders and cancer however the state of florida announced the names of the five applicants that were to be awarded the growers licenses but tropiflora was not among the winners substantial legal objections have arisen as to the florida license award process prompting the filing of a number of complaints and spawning litigation with the state the company believes that among other things tropiflora was unfairly judged for the licensing opportunity the legal complaints instituted by tropiflora while a part of the marij group of companies and before its acquisition by acacia left many questions that can only be answered as the cases progress through the administrative and judicial systems the company continues to seek a florida growers license through its legal efforts and may seek one or more other potential new licensing opportunities within florida andor in other states in addition to the foregoing the company will continue to seek and evaluate other acquisition business combination or merger opportunities such opportunities need not be in our current area of operations and may be more consistent with our objective to become a holding company with a diverse array of businesses click

the company   acacia diversified holdings inc “acacia” or the “company” has two whollyowned subsidiaries marij pharmaceuticals inc and cannacures research  development center inc   the company’s primary source revenue is from the extraction of medicinal cannabis oil from a nonpsychoactive cannabis plant all extraction services are currently limited to the state of colorado as the company is attempting to attain various licenses for business in the state of florida note  – going concern the company has not generated profit to date the company expects to continue to incur operating losses as it proceeds with its extraction and research and development activities and continues to navigate it through the regulatory process the company expects general and administrative costs to increase as the company adds personnel and other administrative expenses associated with its current efforts as such and without substantially increasing revenue or finding new sources of capital the company will find it difficult to continue to meet its obligations as they come due  the company is still locating new clients for its services and products and the business is generally seasonal with the second and third quarters of the calendar year being the slowest as a result of it being the “off season” for outside grow of cannabis hemp plants  the company is currently involved in a capital raise but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to raise capital or if it were successful in raising capital that it would be successful in meeting its business plans  while the services performed by the company’s marij pharma subsidiary and sales of current inventory supplies if sold on a seasonallyadjusted basis are anticipated to be sufficient to meet the company’s liquidity needs these factors raise some doubt as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern  management’s plans include increasing production at the company’s new marij pharma subsidiary during  selling its inventories of products attempting to start new businesses or find additional operational businesses to buy and attempting to raise funds from the public through an equity offering of the company’s common stock management intends to make every effort to identify and develop all these sources of funds but there can be no assurance that management’s plans will be successful the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has incurred losses for all periods presented and has a substantial accumulated deficit as of march   these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the
