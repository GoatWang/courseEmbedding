would like to discuss our announcement today of seagates ceo succession plan today seagates board of directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to executive chairman of seagate and appointed dave mosley as chief executive officer dave and i will assume our new roles effective october  at which time i will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company dave has also been appointed to the seagates board of directors effective immediately over the last two years the board and i have been focused on executive management succession in addition to daves appointment dave morton transitioned to cfo  months ago and recently we have appointed jim murphy executive vice president worldwide sales and marketing kate schuelke as senior vice president chief legal officer and corporate secretary and ravi naik as our senior vice president and chief information officer in addition as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last  months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under senior vice president of operations jeff nygaard and we have reorganized our rd functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements the board and i believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute seagates business strategy capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace and continue to create long term shareholder value its been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as seagates ceo in  of the last  years im grateful to our amazing employees customers suppliers and shareholders and i look forward to working closely with the management team on our future opportunities in my new role as executive chairman at seagate turning to our operational results the overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability and we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into  we remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate it spending growth in the context of the storage marketplace the major transformative shifts from a client server to mobile cloud high capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for seagate the long term trajectory of growth in infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum at the same time the more mature enterprise storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall it storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structural shift to a wide variety of it and cloud service providers accelerates in addition the endtoend storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as  times to  times in the memory markets the effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near time enterprise customer demand softness which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters for the june quarter seagate achieved revenues of approximately  billion gaap gross margins of  net income of  million and diluted earnings per share of  on a nongaap basis seagate achieved gross margins of  up  basis points year over year net income of  million and diluted earnings per share of  hdd exabyte shipments for the june quarter were  exabytes average capacity per drive across the hdd portfolio was approximately  terabytes per drive and asps per unit were  we saw strength in the quarter from our largest nearline us based csp customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers including traditional oem nearline and mission critical demand china csp nearline demand and our own cloud storage systems business in addition there was weakness in the surveillance and nas markets due to some intraquarter channel inventory management as a result our overall revenue results were approximately  below plan with approximately half of that shortfall from our cloud storage systems and half from hdd enterprise weakness and channel inventory management we believe some of these factors particularly china csp demand and nas and surveillance market demand are temporal and supply chain related while some of the oem revenue declines are more structural our nongaap margin results of  were approximately  basis points below our guidance within this approximately twothirds of the impact was due to operational trends issues in our cssg business and approximately onethird was due to lower than expected enterprise and surveillance hdd portfolio mix gaap operating expenses were  million down  year over year and nongaap operating expenses were  million down  year over year cash flow from operations for the quarter was  million and free cash flow was  million up  year over year while we were disappointed to not meet our topline targets in the june quarter seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year  for the year diluted earnings per share grew  on a gaap basis and  on a nongaap basis in addition for fiscal year  we generated  billion in cash flow from operations and returned  of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in summary im pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year  and we are well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems ill now turn the call over to dave morton now to go into more details on our operational activities david h morton jr  seagate technology plc thanks steve for the june quarter we achieved  billion in revenue and shipped  exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of  terabytes for the enterprise market we shipped  exabytes with an average capacity per drive of  terabytes our average capacity per drive for our nearline products has reached over  terabytes per drive up  over last years strong terabyte sales quarter and up  from the june quarter two years ago we continue to ramp our tb nearline product and shipped approximately  units in the june quarter our sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last two quarters and we expect to ship approximately  million tb units in the september quarter in addition our tb product shipped for revenue in the june quarter with excellent customer feedback and we are confident our qualification process is competitive we expect to achieve approximately  of the exabyte share within the tb and tb market by the end of the calendar year the growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployment continue to represent a significant opportunity for seagate and we are confident in our nearline hdd portfolio designed to serve these storage environments over the next  months to  months we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads with use cases from tb to tb products for certain applications and up to  terabyte for other use cases in the client and retail markets our tb per platter inch platform continues to perform well and to date we have shipped over  million drives substantially ahead of the competition using similar technology our tb per platter inch platform began ramping last quarter for desktop markets providing great value for customers needing tb tb and tb client capacity points customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition operating expenses for the june quarter were  million on a gaap basis and  million on a nongaap basis down  year over year total consolidated expenses were slightly lower than forecast primarily due to lower variable compensation we continued to identify areas for cost improvements and this morning we filed a restructuring plan that will provide savings of approximately  million annually these cost actions provide support of our objective to exit the calendar year with nongaap operating expenses of approximately  million per quarter in addition to these actions we will continue to manage our operating expenses tightly targeting approximately  million per quarter by the end of fy  capital expenditures were  million for the june quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new hdd products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment cash flow from operations in the june quarter was  million and free cash flow was  million these results include approximately  million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the june quarter with  billion in cash and cash equivalents and  million ordinary shares outstanding our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of  for the june quarter which will be payable on october  interest expense for the june quarter was  million and will be lower in the september quarter due to the lower debt balance our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities given our staggered maturities and low interest rate in fy  we successfully completed a debt offering of  billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than  and paid  million to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt including our s  senior notes overall our operational and financial performance in fy  reflect execution of our business model profitability improvement objectives and our ability to generate cash flow from our storage portfolio looking ahead we will continue to optimize our business model and focus on our go to market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets i would now like to turn the call back to steve stephen james luczo  seagate technology plc thanks dave turning to the market outlook we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and it and enterprise spending trends we believe the end to end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year and therefore we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher than normal supply chain pricing at the same time we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the csp ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets including pcs and the branded market for the september quarter we are expecting to achieve revenues of between  billion and  billion our gross margin expectations for the september quarter are relatively flat and within our  to  targeted range cash flow from operations will be up sequentially as dave indicated nongaap operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately  million in the september quarter and we expect to exit the december quarter at or below  million while we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of nongaap eps of  for calendar year  we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the december quarter thank you for joining us on the call today and well now open the call up for questions and answers questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question is from steven fox of cross research your line is open steven fox  cross research llc thanks good morning two questions from me first of all on the nearline enterprise business have you identified any market share shifts that might have hurt either the quarter or your outlook and then secondly in terms of the nonhdd business the enterprise systems and flash business youve done a bunch of acquisitions in there over the last few years its had sort of fits and starts and this quarter is somewhat disappointing i guess im wondering if you could just sort of step back and give us your big picture take on those acquisitions and the progress you expect to make in the coming quarters thanks william david mosley phd  seagate technology plc yeah steve this is dave mosley let me try the first one theyre somewhat interrelated i think your two questions so on the nearline side some customers youre heavy with and other customers youre not as heavy with so there are some fundamental shifts going on depending on capacity points i think at the highest capacity points there are some things about our ramp that were not happy with the product is really good and were ramping it hard right now at the lower capacity points the  terabytes and  terabytes and things like that quite happy with our products thats where some of the china csp behavior and the smaller customers and their issues that they had across their supply chain were affected so theres slight share shifts going on but really only the highest capacity point is super relevant and we think thats temporal like i said the two questions that you asked are interrelated somewhat the systems business that we have is – theres a few different kinds of business in there theres some specialty products buildout that we do and then theres some things where were really acting more like an odm ill say and that stuff is not very good business and obviously a lot of odms got themselves into situations with the supply chain issues where either they were underwater or they couldnt procure parts at the right point they had supply that was older supply so to speak so it was a really tough road for the last two quarters in that and were going to have to really take a look at how much of that business we continue to support going forward steven fox  cross research llc great thats very helpful appreciate the color operator thank you our next question is from katy huberty of morgan stanley your line is open kathryn lynn huberty  morgan stanley  co llc yeah thank you steve congrats on retirement dave congrats on the new role just a question on gross margins appreciate that youve guided flat for september but when you take a more medium term look out a couple of quarters is  the right normalized gross margin to think about or are there costs in the september quarter around the  and terabyte ramp around enterprise mix that you think is depressing the gross margin in september and you would expect a rebound from that level thank you stephen james luczo  seagate technology plc so katy let me first say while i appreciate your congratulations on the retirement much to my childrens chagrin i have not retired in fact this is probably the best way for me to stay engaged with the company for a few more years but i did i suppose retire from the ceo job but so im super happy about where im headed and what my engagement will be with the company also super happy that mosley is ceo as i said to someone the other day that running a disc drive company is a little bit like driving in stopandgo traffic sometimes youre going  miles an hour and sometimes youre going  miles an hour but you usually get to your destination on time and no ones hurt but its stressful as shit for the driver and oftentimes for the passengers too so i think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now the – i think your point is right on where were headed on margins the way we see the math to your point clearly ramps are always challenging whether or not its a inch notebook product or a inch surveillance product or a highend nearline product and whenever youre ramping the products the yields come up the ramp and you get better and you also do redesigns and bring costs down and you also start to understand customer needs which allow you to optimize the firmware et cetera et cetera so we would expect that with the ramp on those products and the overall mixup that occurs as customers move from s terabytes to s terabytes to s terabytes to s terabytes that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range i think the good news on the quarter frankly is even with the weakness that we had in nearline and mission critical in certain customer bases and even within the services group the margins that they did contribute were not what they should have been even with that the overall margin structure was pretty solid which i think should give you a good sense of the underlying core hdd business is operating pretty nicely right now and yes it should improve as we execute here in the second half of the year william david mosley phd  seagate technology plc yeah kathryn lynn huberty  morgan stanley  co llc thank you operator thank you our next question is from c j muse of evercore your line is open c j muse  evercore group llc yeah good morning thank you for taking my question i guess two questions first part in terms of your commentary on enterprise can you walk through in a little more detail what youre seeing as temporary versus structural and then i guess as a followup question on the gross margins side is enterprise still above  or do we see it dip below there and how should we think about i guess that part of your business going forward thank you stephen james luczo  seagate technology plc yeah let me answer that and then ill turn the other thing back to mosley like weve never talked about where our gross margins are by products and its a really dangerous game to get in because were so leveraged in our manufacturing and our rd systems that to try and actually splice margins by segments while it may be a fun accounting practice its really deceiving from an overall business practice i will tell you though that our client portfolio has definitely greened up in terms of the technologies were deploying and again we have an areal density lead there thats now going on almost two years so that means fewer heads and discs so to reach the same capacity points those clearly have better margins than they did historically for us competitively so but i think the real message here is that its you have to view it as the manufacturing company as a whole and we strive to get as much leverage as we can across the components into the products as possible william david mosley phd  seagate technology plc and then on the enterprise commentary theres a structural piece in the sense that our mission critical lines are continuing to decrease somewhat some of that is penetration from flash some of thats architectural issues that are going on in the enterprise and we may see some rebound of that with new chipsets that are coming out from intel for example but its kind of interesting because the last few quarters – we saw a strong back half to the last calendar year but the last few quarters have been weaker and thats counter intuitive with flash prices going up the way they did so thats the stuff that were referring to as structural though the temporal stuff its very different if you look at the bill of materials whether youre a cloud service provider youre world – around the world or whether youre an enterprise builder the bill of materials was dramatically upset because of some component price increases and tradeoffs had to be made inside of that in some cases the tradeoffs cant be made because your supply chain cant do the build with the right economics in some cases youll make the tradeoff by saying ill prioritize this memory architecture right now or this amount of dram for example right now and then ill hold the good news on that front for us is – well first the bad news the bad news is exabytes have been rather flat all the way through last year and that doesnt make sense for where the cloud is going the good news is from the discussions that we have with our customers worldwide growth of bits inside of data centers is still on a pretty healthy pace and so this will come back weve seen this a number of different times in our industry and thats why well call it temporal c j muse  evercore group llc very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question is from sherri scribner of deutsche bank your line is open sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc hi thank you i guess i wanted to ask about the restructuring was this something that you already had planned in prior quarters or was the restructuring a result of something that happened during this quarter that made you feel like you needed to take some additional cost actions david h morton jr  seagate technology plc hi sherry this is dave no this has been in constant dialogue and under plan as we continued to drive to a glide path of exiting calendar year – this calendar year under  million and so this has long been in process as we go out and continue to drive further synergies amongst the organizations and how we continue to repivot to higher yielding higher portfolioed product sets that we bring to market so to your point this is something that weve definitely had under long consideration and have taken the necessary actions sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc okay stephen james luczo  seagate technology plc yeah if you go back a year ago we kind of – i think we did at the june call of last year indicate that we were going to take a variety of actions on the manufacturing side to address the capacity issues and where that would have a significant cogs impact which is obviously reflected and secondly that we were going to work opex on two different vectors one was absolute opex dollars and the other was to maintain our margin model that weve committed to and were staying committed to that one as you may remember wasnt kind of on the steady ramp down because the last six months of last year were quite strong and we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand and there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well and that benefited us extremely through fiscal year  where we obviously overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago so i think were back on how do we get to  million i would probably say though as we think about going from  million to  million that that is not a reflection so much of something going on in the market as much as a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments to your opex you obviously then see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions and some of it is also related to things that dave mosley mentioned about whats the quality of business that were doing in the systems side and whats the underlying opex support for that and does that math really make sense so a little bit of that id say in terms of how were going to get from  million to  million but not like marketrelated to the sale of disk drives its more i think related to what we think we can do within the context weve always described as one thats positive sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then on the nearline just quickly that piece i think you did a good job of describing where the weakness was and it sounds like the cloud is still healthy but can you give us some sense of the mix in nearline in terms of the exabyte shipments i think ive heard generally  goes to cloud and  goes to traditional businesses but itd be helpful to have some perspective on that thanks william david mosley phd  seagate technology plc i think its probably a little lower going to the cloud service providers if by the cloud service providers you mean the top – the biggest ones of them right its probably a little bit lower than that historically we did get into this discussion about structural versus temporal and noted some of the weakness among oem nearline worldwide and some of that may be structural as well sherri id say as people are looking to buy they may be buying from odms or other third parties their nontraditional customers and that model is accelerating its not going back to the old way so some of that – thats been soft but some of it may be structural as well sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc thank you stephen james luczo  seagate technology plc okay i think we have time for one more question because i know were running into the open here and we want to be respectful of that operator yes sir our next question is from stanley kovler of citi research your line is open stanley kovler  citigroup global markets inc yes thank you very much for taking the question here i just wanted to better understand where we are from a technical perspective youd talked about some changes in rd in terms of getting to the next node and hamr type of technology and then also if we could just review what you think about in terms of your policy around keeping folks updated around quarters with respect to midquarter updates preannouncements and those types of activities that would be great thank you stephen james luczo  seagate technology plc ill do the hamr first so this is a technology for everyones benefit that weve been working on for quite some time in the hard drive industry its the next scurve the top of the areal density curve that were on right now its getting harder and harder to squeeze that much more out of the progress – and we havent talked about hamr very much in the last two years but the progress has actually been pretty substantial in the labs both on the reliability front which was really the issue and then on the demonstration of areal density front as well so historically we had talked about terabyte drives in  and we still are on path for those kind of demonstrations were going to shoot as high as we can and we may even get above that based on what were seeing in the labs right now but productization is looking more and more favorable all the time and were going to be driving hard from it from inside of seagate so what that means is theres been a lot of discussions about  terabytes and  terabytes and then ultimately well get to  terabytes but we will get to  terabytes and  terabytes some day and were seeing that – those kind of components in the labs right now that with the right amount of coaxing well get them into products and get them out to the markets and then on david h morton jr  seagate technology plc yeah stanley this is dave morton in regards to a definitive process per se on a pre or not a pre i think the approach that the management team took this goround was given the fact that there was so much information coming together and lack of visibility of what was really extending out not only between this quarter but to the back half of the years results we opted to have a further context and full disclosure and earnings call set around the full year versus just the current situation at hand to be able to provide a full context to our investors and shareholders so that was our thought process that went into it stanley kovler  citigroup global markets inc thanks very helpful stephen james luczo  seagate technology plc okay id like to thank everyone for taking the time to be on the call today and thanks to our employees and our customers and suppliers and investors look forward to
