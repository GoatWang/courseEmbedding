closedend funds  a fund may invest in closedend funds the value of the shares of a closedend fund may be higher or lower than the value of the portfolio securities held by the closedend fund closedend investment funds may trade infrequently and with small volume which may make it difficult for the fund to buy and sell shares also the market prices of closedend investment companies tend to rise more in response to buying demand and fall more in response to selling pressure than is the case with larger capitalization companies in addition since many but not all closedend funds trade on exchanges the fund will also incur brokerage expenses and commissions when it buys or sells closedend fund shares that are exchangetraded equity securities the equity portion of a fund’s portfolio may include common stocks traded on domestic and international securities exchanges preferred stocks and convertible securities warrants or rights that give the holder the right to buy a common stock at a given time for a specified price the price of equity securities may fluctuate in response to various factors including the activities of the individual companies that issued the securities general market and economic conditions and specific industry changes such price fluctuations subject the fund to potential losses in addition regardless of any one company’s particular prospects a declining stock market may produce a decline in prices for all equity securities which could also result in losses for the fund market declines may continue for an indefinite period of time and investors should understand that during temporary or extended bear markets the value of equity securities will decline investment companies with respect to any investment by each of the american equity fund the global equity fund and the treasury fund in an unaffiliated investment company section da of the  act requires that as determined immediately after a purchase is made i not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets will be invested in the securities of any one investment company ii not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets will be invested in securities of investment companies as a group and iii not more than  of the outstanding voting stock of any one investment company will be owned by the fund the funds will limit their investments in unaffiliated funds in accordance with these section da limitations except as otherwise provided herein and to the extent that any rules regulations or noaction or exemptive relief under the  act permits the funds to exceed such investment limits in unaffiliated investment companies by investing in an investment company a fund will be subject to two layers of fees because such investment companies pay advisory administrative andor service fees that are borne indirectly by investors in addition a fund will be subject to the same risks that other investors experience when making such investments including the risks of significant fluctuations in assets as a result of a cash sweep program or purchase and redemption activity by shareholders in such other funds none of the american equity fund the global equity fund or the treasury fund may acquire any securities of an investment company or any series thereof or of a registered unit investment trust in reliance on section dg of the  act which permits a mutual fund to invest in an unlimited amount of securities of another fund that is part of the same group of investment companies or in reliance on section df of the  act which provides an additional exception to the restrictions set forth in section da except as otherwise provided herein any of these funds may invest its cash holdings in affiliated or nonaffiliated money market funds as part of a cash sweep program and may purchase unlimited shares of affiliated or nonaffiliated money market funds and of other funds managed by the adviser whether registered or unregistered entities as permitted by the  act and rules promulgated thereunder andor an sec exemptive order the multiasset real return fund may in certain circumstances invest in an unaffiliated investment company in reliance on section df of the  act which provides that the restrictions set forth in section d of the  act shall not apply to securities purchased or otherwise acquired by a fund if i immediately after such purchase or acquisition not more than  of the total outstanding shares of such investment company is owned by the fund and all affiliated persons of the fund and ii the fund has not offered or sold and is not proposing to offer or sell its shares through a principal underwriter or otherwise at a public or offering price that includes a sales load of more than   exchangetraded funds a fund may invest in etfs many etfs acquire and hold securities of each company or other issuer or a representative sampling of each company or other issuer that make up a particular index with the intention of providing investment results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the relevant index in contrast actively managed etfs are managed in a similar manner to that of other investment companies an investment in an etf generally presents the same primary risks as an investment in a nonexchange traded investment company and will have costs and expenses that will be passed on to the fund thereby increasing the fund’s expenses etfs are also subject to additional risks including i the market price of an etf’s shares may trade at a discount to net asset value causing the etf to experience greater price volatility ii an active trading market for an etf’s shares may not develop or be maintained at a sufficient volume iii the exchange on which an etf’s shares are listed may deem it appropriate to halt the trading of such shares iv etf shares may be delisted from the exchange on which they trade or “circuit breakers” which are tied to large decreases in stock prices used by the exchange may temporarily halt trading in the etf’s stock v there may be legal limitations and other conditions imposed by sec rules on the amount of etf shares that the fund may acquire and vi an etf may be terminated and need to liquidate its portfolio securities at a time when the prices for those securities are falling exchangetraded notes a fund may invest in exchangetraded notes “etns” which are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities issued by a bank or other financial institution etns have a maturity date and are backed only by the credit of their issuer etn returns are linked to the performance of a market benchmark or strategy less any fees charged to investors etns can be exchangetraded at market price or held until maturity etn issuers typically make interest payments and a principal payment at maturity that is linked to the price movement of an underlying market benchmark or strategy investing in etns involves various risks including market risk liquidity risk and counterparty risk for example the value of an etn will fluctuate as the value of the underlying market benchmark or strategy fluctuates underlying market benchmark prices are determined based on a variety of market and economic factors and may change unpredictably which in turn will affect the value of the benchmarks and consequently the value of the applicable etn if the value of an underlying market benchmark decreases or does not increase by an amount greater than the aggregate investor fee applicable to an etn then an investor in the etn will receive less than its original investment in the etn upon maturity or early redemption and could lose up to  of the original principal amount in addition the issuer of an etn may restrict the etn’s redemption amount or its redemption date and may not be required to maintain the etn’s listing on an exchange in the event that an etn is no longer exchangelisted there can be no assurance that a secondary market will exist for the etn money market instruments a fund may invest in money market instruments money market instruments may include us government obligations or corporate debt obligations including those subject to repurchase agreements banker’s acceptances and certificates of deposit of domestic branches of us banks commercial paper and variable amount demand master notes “master notes” banker’s acceptances are time drafts drawn on and “accepted” by a bank when a bank “accepts” such a time draft it assumes liability for its payment when a fund acquires a banker’s acceptance the bank that “accepted” the time draft is liable for payment of interest and principal when due the banker’s acceptance carries the full faith and credit of such bank a certificate of deposit is an unsecured interest bearing debt obligation of a bank commercial paper is an unsecured shortterm debt obligation of a bank corporation or other borrower commercial paper maturity generally ranges from two to  days and is usually sold on a discounted basis rather than as an interestbearing instrument commercial paper may include master notes of the same quality master notes are unsecured obligations that are redeemable upon demand of the holder and that permit the investment of fluctuating amounts at varying rates of interest master notes will be acquired by a fund only through the master note program of the funds’ custodian bank acting as administrator thereof the adviser will monitor on a continuous basis the earnings power cash flow and other liquidity ratios of the issuer of a master note held by the fund fixedincome securities fixedincome securities are obligations of the issuer of the securities to make payments of principal andor interest on future dates fixedincome securities include but are not limited to securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or governmentsponsored enterprises corporate debt securities issued by us and nonus entities mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities structured notes and inflationindexed bonds issued both by governments and corporations fixedincome securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will be unable to meet principal and interest payments and the risk of price volatility due to a variety of factors including interest rate sensitivity market perception of the issuer’s creditworthiness and general market conditions as interest rates rise the value of fixedincome securities typically decline fixedincome securities with longer durations  ie  the measure of the expected life of a fixedincome security that is used to determine the sensitivity of a security’s price to changes in interest rates tend to be more sensitive to interest rate movements than those with shorter durations   reits  to the extent that a fund invests in real estate investment trusts reits it will be subject to the risks associated with owning real estate and with the real estate industry generally these include difficulties in valuing and disposing of real estate the possibility of declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and local economic conditions the possibility of adverse changes in the climate for real estate environmental liability risks the risk of increases in property taxes and operating expenses possible adverse changes in zoning laws the risk of casualty or condemnation losses limitations on rents the possibility of adverse changes in interest rates and in the credit markets and the possibility of borrowers paying off mortgages sooner than expected which may lead to reinvestment of assets at lower prevailing interest rates to the extent a fund invests in reits it will also be subject to the risk that a reit will default on its obligations or go bankrupt by investing in reits indirectly through a fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the fund but also indirectly similar expenses of the reits these additional expenses are included under “other expenses” in the annual fund operating expenses detailed above a fund’s investments in reits could cause the fund to recognize income in excess of cash received from those securities and as a result the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities including when it is not advantageous to do so in order to make required distributions  treasury inflationprotected securities a fund may invest a portion of its assets in treasury inflationprotected securities “tips” any adjustment for inflation to the principal amount of an inflationprotected us treasury bond held by the fund may be included for tax purposes in the gross income of the fund even if the fund did not receive cash attributable to such gross income in such event the fund may be required to make annual distributions to shareholders that exceed the cash it has otherwise received to pay such distributions the fund may be required to raise cash by selling portfolio investments which could result in capital gains to the fund and additional capital gain distributions to fund shareholders debentures a fund may invest in debentures which are longterm unsecured debt instruments backed only by the integrity of the borrowers not by collateral and documented by indentures governments often issue debentures in part because they generally cannot guarantee debt with assets government assets are public property the primary risk of a debenture is that the issuer will default or go into bankruptcy as an unsecured creditor in the event of default or bankruptcy the holder of a debenture does not have a claim against any specific assets of the issuing firm so the investor will only be paid from the issuer’s assets after the secured creditors have been paid a fund may invest in all types of debentures including corporate and government debentures derivative investments transactions in derivatives entail certain risks for example unanticipated changes in interest rates securities prices or currency exchange rates may result in a poorer overall performance of a fund than if it had not entered into any derivatives transactions derivatives may magnify a fund’s gain or loss causing it to make or lose substantially more than it invested when used for hedging purposes any losses incurred with a derivative should be offset by increases in the value of the securities a fund holds or intends to acquire a fund’s ability to hedge securities through derivatives depends on the degree to which price movements in the underlying index or instrument correlate with price movements in the relevant securities in the case of poor correlation the price of the securities the fund is hedging may not move in the same amount or even in the same direction as the hedging instrument the adviser will try to minimize this risk by investing only in those contracts whose behavior the adviser expects to resemble the portfolio securities it is trying to hedge but if the predictions of interest and currency rates market value volatility or other economic factors are incorrect the fund may lose money or may not make as much money as it expected the fund may also lose money if its adviser incorrectly predicts securities market and interest rate trends from time to time a fund may invest in currency options contracts the values of which are expected to correlate with exchange rates because the value of a fund’s foreigndenominated investments changes in response to many factors other than exchange rates it may not be possible to match the amount of currency options to the value of the fund’s investments precisely over time before an option is exercised or expires the fund can terminate it only by entering into a closing purchase or sale transaction although the funds intend to purchase options only where there appears to be an active market there is no guarantee that such a liquid market will exist if there is no secondary or liquid market for the contract a fund may not be able to close out a position and as a result the fund may have to sell securities to meet its daily margin requirements at a time when it is disadvantageous to do so purchase or sell the instrument underlying the contract cease hedging its investments and be unable to realize profits or limit its losses specific risks of purchasing and writing options the purchase and writing of options involves certain risks during the option period the covered call writer has in return for the premium on the option given up the opportunity to profit from a price increase in the underlying securities above the exercise price but as long as its obligation as a writer continues has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline the writer of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a writer of the option once an option writer has received an exercise notice it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying securities at the exercise price if a put or call option purchased by a fund is not sold when it has remaining value and if the market price of the underlying security in the case of a put remains equal to or greater than the exercise price or in the case of a call remains less than or equal to the exercise price the fund will lose its entire investment in the option also where a put or call option on a particular security is purchased to hedge against price movements in a related security the price of the put or call option may move more or less than the price of the related security there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when a fund seeks to close out an option position furthermore if trading restrictions or suspensions are imposed on the options market a fund may be unable to close out a position  foreign securities a fund may invest in foreign securities and foreign currency contracts as consistent with its stated investment objectives and restrictions foreign securities and foreign currency contracts involve investment risks different from those associated with investments in domestic securities the value of foreign currency denominated securities or foreign currency contracts is affected by the value of the local currency relative to the us dollar there may be less government supervision of foreign markets resulting in nonuniform accounting practices and less publicly available information about issuers of foreign currency denominated securities the value of foreign investments may be affected by changes in exchange control regulations application of foreign tax laws including withholding tax changes in governmental administration or economic or monetary policy in this country or abroad or changed circumstances in dealings between nations in addition foreign brokerage commissions custody fees and other costs of investing in foreign securities are generally higher than in the united states investments in foreign issues could be affected by other factors not present in the united states including expropriation armed conflict confiscatory taxation and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations forward commitment and whenissued securities a fund may purchase securities on a whenissued basis or for settlement at a future date if the fund holds sufficient assets to meet the purchase price in such purchase transactions the fund will not accrue interest on the purchased security until the actual settlement similarly if a security is sold for a forward date the fund will accrue the interest until the settlement of the sale whenissued security purchases and forward commitments have a higher degree of risk of price movement before settlement due to the extended time period between the execution and settlement of the purchase or sale as a result the exposure to the counterparty of the purchase or sale is increased although a fund would generally purchase securities on a forward commitment or whenissued basis with the intention of taking delivery the fund may sell such a security prior to the settlement date if the adviser to the fund feels such action is appropriate in such a case the fund could incur a shortterm gain or loss repurchase agreements a repurchase transaction occurs when an investor purchases a security normally a us treasury obligation then resells it to the vendor normally a member bank of the federal reserve or a registered government securities dealer and is required to deliver the security andor securities substituted for them under the repurchase agreement to the vendor on an agreed upon date in the future the repurchase price exceeds the purchase price by an amount which reflects an agreed upon market interest rate effective for the period of time during which the repurchase agreement is in effect delivery pursuant to the resale normally will occur within one to seven days of the purchase portfolio turnover since portfolio turnover may involve paying brokerage commissions and other transaction costs there could be additional expenses for the funds high rates of portfolio turnover could lower performance of the funds due to increased costs and may also result in the realization of capital gains if the funds realize capital gains when they sell portfolio investments they must generally distribute those gains to shareholders increasing their taxable distributions temporary defensive positions a fund may from time to time take temporary defensive positions that are inconsistent with the fund’s principal investment strategies in an attempt to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions during such an unusual set of circumstances a fund may hold up to  of its portfolio in cash or cash equivalent positions  eg  money market securities us government securities andor similar securities in the event that a fund takes a temporary defensive position the fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective general investment risks all investments in securities and other financial instruments involve a risk of financial loss no assurance can be given that a fund’s investment program will be successful investors should carefully review the prospectus and sai

manager has responsibility for managing more than one account potential conflicts of interest may arise those conflicts could include preferential treatment of one account over others in terms of

performancebased fee with respect to certain accounts the procedures to address such potential conflicts of interest are described below   to the extent that the portfolio manager manages other accounts this may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with his management of a funds investments on the one hand and the investments of the other accounts on the other the other accounts may have the same investment objective as a fund therefore a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the identical investment objectives whereby the portfolio manager could favor one account over another another potential conflict could include the portfolio manager’s knowledge about the size timing and possible market impact of a fund’s trades whereby the portfolio manager could use this information to the advantage of other accounts and to the disadvantage of a fund however the adviser has established policies and procedures to ensure that the purchase and sale of securities among all accounts it manages are fairly and equitably allocated   compensation    the adviser seeks to maintain a competitive compensation program each portfolio manager’s compensation consists of a fixed annual salary or draw and potential bonus or equity plus additional remuneration based on the adviser’s profitability as applicable among other factors the portfolio managers’

consideration to sales of shares of the funds as a factor in selecting brokerdealers to execute portfolio securities transactions the adviser may however place portfolio transactions with brokerdealers that promote or sell the funds’ shares so long as such transactions are done in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the trustees that are designed to ensure that the selection is based on the quality of the brokerdealer’s execution and not on its sales efforts in selecting brokerdealers to be used in portfolio transactions the general principle guiding the adviser is to obtain the best overall execution for each trade which is a combination of price and execution with respect to execution the adviser considers a number of discretionary factors including without limitation the brokerdealer’s financial strength reputation execution quality pricing commission rates and service in seeking best execution the determinative factor is not always the lowest possible cost but whether the transaction represents the best qualitative execution taking into consideration the full range of brokerage services including factors such as execution capability commission rates and responsiveness although the adviser will seek competitive rates it may not necessarily obtain the lowest possible commission rates for a fund’s transactions recognizing the value of these discretionary factors the adviser may select brokers who charge a brokerage commission that is higher than the lowest commission that might otherwise be available for any given trade under section e of the securities exchange act of  “section e” and the advisory agreements the adviser is authorized to pay a brokerage commission in excess of that which another broker might have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage andor research services provided by the broker the adviser may receive research and brokerage services that include but are

nonresearch function in cash using its own funds the research and investment information services described above make available to the adviser for its analysis and consideration the views and information of individuals and research staffs of other securities firms these services may be useful to the adviser in connection with advisory clients other than the funds and not all such services may be useful to the adviser in connection with the funds although such information may be a useful supplement to the adviser’s own investment information in rendering services to the funds the value of such research and services is not expected to reduce materially the expenses of the adviser in the performance of its services under the advisory agreements and will not reduce the management fees payable to the adviser by the funds the funds may participate if and when practicable in bidding for the purchase of securities directly from an issuer in order to take advantage of the lower purchase

  the nav per share of each fund is calculated at the close of regular trading on the nyse ordinarily  pm eastern time only on business days that the nyse is open for business the funds do not calculate nav on business holidays when the nyse is closed the nyse generally recognizes the following holidays new year’s day martin luther king jr day president’s day good friday memorial day fourth of july labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day any other holiday recognized by the nyse will be deemed a business holiday on which the nav of the fund will not be calculated   in computing a

the result is the nav per share of that fund   values are determined according to accepted accounting practices and all laws and regulations that apply the assets of the funds are valued as follows   • securities that are listed on a securities exchange or are quoted by nasdaq are valued at their last sales price on the principal exchange on which the security is traded at the time the valuation is made   • securities that are listed on an exchange and which are not traded on a particular day are valued at the closing bid price   • securities traded in the overthecounter market and which are not quoted by nasdaq are valued at their last sale price or if not available at their last bid price as quoted by brokers that make markets in the securities   • shortterm instruments with maturities of  days or less will be valued at amortized cost which approximates market value    • securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith using methods approved by the trustees securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service when such prices are believed to reflect the fair market value of such securities   the pricing and valuation of portfolio securities is determined in good faith in accordance with procedures established by and under the direction of the trustees in valuing a fund’s total assets portfolio securities are generally valued at their market value securities and assets for which representative market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith under policies approved by the trustees   additional tax information   the following summarized certain additional tax considerations generally affecting the funds and its shareholders that are not described in the prospectus no attempt is made to present a detailed explanation of the tax treatment of the funds or its shareholders the discussions here and in the prospectus are not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning and are based on tax laws and regulations that are in effect on the date hereof and which may be changed by legislative judicial or administrative action investors are advised to consult their tax advisors with specific reference to their own tax situations   the funds have each qualified and elected to be treated as a “regulated investment company” under subchapter m of the code during its previous fiscal periods and intends to continue to do so in the future a fund that is qualified under subchapter m will not be subject to federal income tax on the part of its net ordinary income and net realized capital gains which it distributes to its shareholders the trust anticipates that each fund will not be subject to federal income or excise taxes because the funds intend to distribute all of its net investment income and net capital gains to its shareholders for a fiscal year in accordance with the timing requirements of the code and to meet other requirements of the code relating to the sources of income and diversification of its assets   investment income received by a fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source if more than  of the value of a fund’s total assets at the close of its taxable year consists of the stock or securities of foreign corporations a fund may elect to “pass through” to the fund’s shareholders the amount of foreign income taxes paid by the fund   all dividends from net investment income together with those derived from the excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss collectively “income dividends” will be taxable provided that certain holding period and other requirements are satisfied to shareholders as either ordinary income or “qualified dividend income” as discussed below any distributions derived from the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss “capital gains distributions” are taxable as longterm capital gains to shareholders regardless of the length of time a shareholder has owned his shares any loss realized upon the redemption of shares within six months after the date of their purchase will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of amounts treated as distributions of net longterm capital gain during such sixmonth period   a fund of funds is eligible to passthrough a to individual shareholders qualified dividend income earned by an underlying fund which is subject to federal income tax at reduced longterm capital gain rates and b to corporate shareholders income that is eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction each fund calculates income dividends and capital gain distributions the same way for each class the amount of any income dividends per share will differ however generally due to any differences in the distribution and service rule b fees applicable to the classes   income dividends and capital gains distributions are taxed in the manner described above regardless of whether they are received in cash or reinvested in additional shares shareholders of each fund will receive information annually on form  with respect to the amount and nature of dividend income and capital gain distributions to assist them in reporting the prior calendar year’s distributions on their federal income tax return   distributions that are declared in october november or december but which are not paid to shareholders until the following january will be treated for tax purposes as if received on december  of the year in which they were declared   the exchange of a fund’s shares for shares of another fund will generally be treated as a taxable sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes and any gain thereon may be subject to federal income tax   when an income dividend or capital gains distribution is paid by a fund net asset value per share of the fund is reduced automatically by the amount of the dividend andor distribution if nav per share is reduced below a shareholder’s cost basis as a result such a distribution might still be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as the case may be although in effect it represents a return of invested capital for this reason investors should consider carefully the desirability of purchasing shares immediately prior to a distribution date   the american equity fund the global equity fund and the multiasset real return fund may invest in foreign issuers which meet the definition in the code of passive foreign investment companies “pfics” a fund’s income and gain if any from the holding of pfic stock may be subject to a nondeductible tax at the fund level a fund may be able to eliminate this tax by making certain elections with respect to any of its investments which are treated as pfics  under the code a fund may be required to impose backup withholding currently at a rate of  on income dividends and capital gains distributions and payment of redemption proceeds to individuals and other nonexempt shareholders if such shareholders have not provided a correct taxpayer identification number and made the certifications required by the internal revenue service on the account application a shareholder in a fund may also be subject to backup withholding if the internal revenue service or a broker notifies the fund that the shareholder is subject to backup withholding a fund may liquidate the account of any of its shareholder who fails to furnish its certificate of taxpayer identification number within thirty  days after date the account was opened   the treatment of income dividends and capital gains distributions to shareholders of a fund under the various foreign state and local income tax laws may not parallel that under the federal law shareholders are encouraged to consult their tax adviser with respect to applicable foreign state and local taxes

–description of ratings   the funds may acquire from time to time certain securities that meet the following minimum rating criteria “investmentgrade debt securities” or if not rated of equivalent quality as determined by the adviser the various ratings used by the nationally recognized securities rating services are described below   a rating by a rating service represents the service’s opinion as to the credit quality of the security being rated however the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer consequently the adviser believes that the quality of investmentgrade debt securities in which the funds may invest should be continuously reviewed and that individual analysts give different weightings to the various factors involved in credit analysis a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor when a security has received a rating from more than one service each rating is evaluated independently ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the rating services from other sources that they consider reliable ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other reasons   standard  poor’s ratings services the following summarizes the highest four ratings used by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” a division of mcgrawhill companies inc for bonds which are deemed to be investmentgrade debt securities by the adviser   aaa –    this is the highest rating assigned by sp to a debt obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   aa –   debt rated aa differs from aaa issues only in a small degree the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong   a –   debt rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higherrated categories however the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong   bbb –   debt rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   to provide more detailed indications of credit quality the aa a and bbb ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within these major rating categories   bonds rated bb b ccc cc and c are not considered by the adviser to be investmentgrade debt securities and are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the lowest degree of speculation and c the highest degree of speculation while such bonds may have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions   commercial paper rated a by sp indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment is strong those issues determined to possess extremely strong safety characteristics are denoted a capacity for timely payment on commercial paper rated a is satisfactory but the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues designated a   the rating sp is the highest rating assigned by sp to short term notes and indicates strong capacity to pay principal and interest an issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service is given a plus  designation the rating sp indicates a satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes the rating sp indicates a speculative capacity to pay principal and interest   moody’s investor service inc the following summarizes the highest four ratings used by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” for fixedincome obligations with an original maturity of one year or more which are deemed to be investmentgrade securities by the adviser   aaa –   bond obligations rated aaa are judged to be of the highest quality with minimal credit risk   aa –   bond obligations rated aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk   a –   bond obligations rated a are considered uppermedium grade and are subject to low credit risk   baa –   bond obligations rated baa are subject to moderate credit risk they are considered mediumgrade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics   obligations that are rated ba b caa ca or c by moody’s are not considered “investmentgrade debt securities” by the adviser obligations rated ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk obligations rated b are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk obligations rated caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk a note moody’s appends numerical modifiers   and  to each generic rating classification from aa through caa the modifier  indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category   shortterm ratings   moody’s shortterm ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor shortterm financial obligations ratings may be assigned to issuers shortterm programs or individual shortterm debt instruments such obligations generally have an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months unless explicitly noted   moody’s employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers   p – issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations   p – issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a strong ability to repay shortterm debt obligations   p – issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have an acceptable ability to repay shortterm debt obligations   np – issuers or supporting institutions rated not prime do not fall within any of the prime rating categories   note canadian issuers rated p or p have their shortterm ratings enhanced by the seniormost longterm rating of the issuer its guarantor or supportprovider   us municipal shortterm debt and demand obligation ratings   shortterm debt ratings there are three rating categories for shortterm municipal obligations that are considered investment grade these ratings are designated as municipal investment grade mig and are divided into three levels – mig  through mig  in addition those shortterm obligations that are of speculative quality are designated sg or speculative grade mig ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation   mig  – this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows highly reliable liquidity support or demonstrated broadbased access to the market for refinancing   mig  – this designation denotes strong credit quality margins of protection are ample although not as large as in the preceding group   mig  – this designation denotes acceptable credit quality liquidity and cashflow protection may be narrow and market access for refinancing is likely to be less wellestablished   sg – this designation denotes speculativegrade credit quality debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins of protection   demand obligation ratings in the case of variable rate demand obligations vrdos a twocomponent rating is assigned a long or shortterm debt rating and a demand obligation rating the first element represents moody’s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with scheduled principal and interest payments the second element represents moody’s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with the ability to receive purchase price upon demand demand feature using a variation of the mig rating scale the variable municipal investment grade or vmig rating   when either the long or shortterm aspect of a vrdo is not rated that piece is designated nr eg aaanr or nrvmig    vmig rating expirations are a function of each issue’s specific structural or credit features   vmig  – this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by the superior shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand   vmig  – this designation denotes strong credit quality good protection is afforded by the strong shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand   vmig  – this designation denotes acceptable credit quality adequate protection is afforded by the satisfactory shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand a sg – this designation denotes speculativegrade credit quality demand features rated in this category may be supported by a liquidity provider that does not have an investment grade shortterm rating or may lack the structural andor legal protections necessary to ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand   fitch ratings the following summarizes the highest four ratings used by fitch inc “fitch”   longterm ratings   aaa – highest credit quality the rating aaa denotes that the lowest expectation of credit risk they are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events   aa – very high credit quality the rating aa denotes a very low expectation of credit risk they indicate very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events   a – high credit quality the rating a denotes a low expectation of credit risk the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered strong this capacity may nevertheless be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher rating   bbb – good credit quality the rating bbb indicates that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity this is the lowest investment grade category   longterm securities rated below bbb by fitch are not considered by the adviser to be investmentgrade securities securities rated bb and b are regarded as speculative with regard to a possible credit risk developing bb is considered speculative and b is considered highly speculative securities rated ccc cc and c are regarded as a high default risk a rating cc indicates that default of some kind appears probable while a rating c signals imminent default securities rated ddd dd and d indicate a default has occurred   shortterm ratings   f – highest credit quality the rating f indicates the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments may have an added  to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature   f – good credit quality the rating f indicates a satisfactory capacity for timely payment of financial commitment but the margin of safety is not as great as in the case of the higher ratings   f – fair credit quality the rating f indicates the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate however nearterm adverse changes could result in a reduction to noninvestment grade   b – speculative the rating b indicates minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments plus vulnerability to nearterm adverse changes in financial and economic conditions   shortterm rates b c and d by fitch are considered by the adviser to be below investmentgrade securities shortterm securities rated b are considered speculative securities rated c have a high default risk and securities rated d denote actual or imminent payment default    or  suffixes may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories such suffixes are not added to longterm ratings “aaa” category categories below “ccc” or shortterm ratings other than “f” the suffix “nr” indicates that fitch does not publicly rate the issuer or issue in question a appendix b – proxy voting policies   the

policies and procedures of centre asset management llc   general policy centre believes that the review and voting of proxies is an important part of portfolio management as it represents an opportunity for shareholders to make their voices heard and to influence the direction of a company centre is committed to voting corporate proxies solely in a manner that serves the economic best interests of its clients centre evaluates the competence experience reputation and capital allocation skills of a company’s management as part of its qualitative assessment within the investment decision making process therefore centre generally follows the socalled “wall street rule” ie  it votes as management recommends or sells the stock prior to the annual meeting if there is a significant management sponsored voting issue that is not consistent with the economic best interests of the funds’ shareholders this does not mean that we take corporate governance lightly but rather it is confirmation that our process of investing with shareholder aligned management is working however if we determine that managements’ position on a particular issue deemed not material enough to trigger a sale of the stocks is not in the best interest of our clients we will vote contrary to management’s recommendation or abstain from voting also there may be instances where we determine that not voting is in the best economic interests of our clients the practicalities and costs involved with international investing may make it impossible at times and at other times disadvantageous to vote proxies in every instance for example we might refrain from voting if we or our agents are required to appear in person at a shareholder meeting or if the exercise of voting rights results in the imposition of trading or other ownership restrictions conflicts of interest proxy solicitations that involve a conflict of interest or might appear to involve a conflict of interest between centre and its clients will be handled in one of the following ways · engage an independent party to determine how to vote the proxy · prepare a report that i describes the conflict of interest ii discusses procedures used to address such conflict of interest iii discloses any contacts from outside parties other than routine communications from proxy solicitors regarding the proposal and iv confirms the recommendation was made solely on the investment merits and without regard to any other consideration · refer the proxy to the client or to a representative of the client for voting purposes · disclose the conflict to the affected clients and seek their consent to vote the proxy prior to casting the vote   b · vote in accordance with the predetermined voting policy the wall street rule outlined and disclosed to clients in our general policy or · seek guidance from the board of trustees record keeping centre t will maintain the following records with respect to proxy voting · a copy of this proxy voting policy · a copy of all proxy statements received centre may rely on a third party for this service such as proxyedge · a record of each vote cast on behalf of a fund centre may rely on a third party for this service such as proxyedge · a copy of any report or document prepared by centre that was material to making a voting decision or that memorializes the basis for that decision and · a copy of each written client request for information on how centre voted proxies on the client’s behalf and a copy of any written response to any written or oral client request for
