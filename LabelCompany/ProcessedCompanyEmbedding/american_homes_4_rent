to own some within the first week of signing up what is the difference between rent to own lease option lease purchase rent to buy owner financing and land contract lease option transactions are also known as rent to own or rent to buy transactions in a lease option the landlordseller leases the home to the tenantbuyer and the tenantbuyer has the option to purchase the home for a predetermined price at any point prior to the end of the lease the main components of a lease option transaction are the lease term the purchase price the down payment and the rent credit lease purchase transactions are similar to lease options however rather than granting the tenantbuyer the option to purchase the home lease purchases contractually obligate the tenantbuyer to purchase the home owner financing agreements and land contracts have similar payment schedules to that of lease options and lease purchases however these agreements enable the buyer to purchase the home and obtain title at the beginning of the transaction the seller instead of receiving a large cash payment at the time of purchase as heshe would in a conventional sale serves as a lender for the remainder of the agreement and collects monthly financing payments from the buyer when the owner financing agreement or land contract expires the buyer obtains thirdparty mortgage financing and fully repays the seller
