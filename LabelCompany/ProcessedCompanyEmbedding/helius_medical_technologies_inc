mirror nerve impulses to the brain through goldplated electrodes on the mouthpiece which is placed on the tongue stimulation of the brain and brainstem via cranial nerve innervation of the tongue is hypothesized to encourage neuroplasticity or a rerouting enabling the damaged brain to compensate for lost function due to trauma or disease by recruiting existing working neurons pons tm  when used in combination with specialized physical or cognitive therapy has been shown to improve symptoms of patients with chronic neurological symptoms caused by disease or trauma relative to most neurological drug and device treatments shorter clinical timelines fewer study subjects and a shortened regulatory pathway offer relatively lowercost opportunities to bring new indications to market key nearterm focus is the ongoing fda registrational trial for pons therapy for the treatment of balance deficit associated with mild to moderate tbi investment highlights for helius medical technologies one of the few pureplay medical device company in the large and growing neuromodulation market the neuromodulation market is estimated at nearly  billion worldwide by  and is expected to grow in the double digits on a percentage basis annually significant industry consolidation by large diversified medical device companies has left few pureplay companies developing and commercializing novel therapies differentiated technologies like the pons tm device capture market share relatively quickly postlaunch helius has a number of compelling milestones the company has a goal to have its shares listed on a us national securities exchange a critical component in potentially broadening the us institutional investor base data from the  patient doubleblind randomized shamcontrolled trial in tbi is expected to read out in early h assuming fda clearance the kde novo to class ii device classification could allow for commercial launch as early as h pons tm therapy could play a unique role in the treatment paradigm for multiple neurological deficits the unique and noninvasive neuromodulation approach in conjunction with physical or cognitive therapy as well as pharmacotherapies could allow for potential broad applicability across a range of indications beyond tbi positive outcomes with pons tm therapy could reduce the cost of pharmaceutical and rehabilitation treatments for patients that are incurred with todays care plans flexible business model if the pons tm therapy is approved for commercialization the combination of the wearable pulse generator and disposable mouthpiece could result in a recurring revenue stream the service model is expected to launch in a clinic setting initially with potential expansion to homebased therapy care plan support model with existing reimbursement for treatment the de novo device classification affords for relatively short clinical trials with a small number of subjects translating to relatively low cost development to expand into additional indications risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making a decision to invest in our common stock these risks are

electrotactile stimulation is the process of using a small stimulation electrode to pass a small electric current through the skin producing controlled localized touch sensations this generates an electric field in subcutaneous tissue which directly excites the afferent nerve fibers those that direct impulses toward the central nervous system responsible for normal mechanical touch sensations the stimulation is perceived as tingling pressure vibration or a pinprick depending on the electrode and stimulation waveform properties depending on the characteristics of the stimulation and the afferent nerves electrotactile stimulation may directly or indirectly induce neuromodulation neuromodulation neuromodulation is the use of external stimulation to intentionally change and regulate the electrochemical environment of the brain other contemporary forms of neurostimulation aimed at inducing neuromodulation are costly and invasive with the potential for adverse effects for example deep brain stimulation which uses implanted pacemakerlike electrical devices to decrease tremors in parkinson’s carries surgical risks pons™therapy couples electrical stimulation with targeted functional therapy including physical occupational and cognitive exercises based on the patient’s deficits stimulation is deployed through the tongue using the pons™ device to stimulate two major cranial nerves the trigeminal the nerve responsible for sensations in the face biting and chewing and the facial the nerve responsible for motor control of most of the muscles of facial expression neuroplasticity
