and putnam municipal bond fund nyse pmg would be merged into putnam municipal opportunities trust nyse pmo and putnam high yield municipal trust nyse pym would be merged into putnam managed municipal

net asset value of their shares following the merger less any applicable temporary redemption fees which are not expected to exceed  of amounts redeemed in giving their approval in principle the trustees considered among other things the possibility that these funds would not be able to continue to operate in their present closedend form the pattern of trading discounts changes in the funds�

share repurchase program under which each fund is authorized to repurchase up to  of its outstanding shares over a year period ending in october  this program enhances shareholder value as repurchases made at a discount increase the net asset value per share of a fund�s remaining shares and has made a meaningful contribution to investment return the program has been suspended indefinitely for pca
