informed that if you made additional contributions to your contract we would automatically allocate them to portfolios we had selected other than the pioneer vct portfolios listed above unless you

consent to allocate your contributions to the portfolios we selected we have now determined to reallocate such contributions received subsequent to november   to the pioneer vct class i portfolios that became the successor to the rst portfolio as noted above to accomplish this unless you instruct us otherwise on february   we will transfer any additional contributions you made since december   that should have been allocated to the pioneer vct class i portfolios that became the successors to the rst portfolios you were invested in on november   to such pioneer vct class i portfolio it is possible that as a result of our allocation method in effect for new contributions you could have gained or lost money over what you would have earned had we not implemented our allocation method if you gained money over what you would have earned that gain will remain in your contract if there is a loss we will make up the difference this will be done by comparing what your account value would have been had your subsequent contributions since december   been invested in the appropriate pioneer vct class i portfolio as compared to what your account value actually is worth on february   if there was a transfer or a withdrawal before february   we will make such comparisons using the transfer or withdrawal date for contract owners who withdrew all of their account values from their contracts and who lost money as a result of our allocation method we will make up any loss so long as the loss is at least  per portfolio the following is an example of how this will work for a

in pioneer fund vct portfolio  class i as a result of the merger on june   contract owner a made a new contribution to her contract and because she did not instruct us otherwise her contribution was put into the pioneer equity income vct portfolio  class ii and not the pioneer fund vct portfolio  class i to determine whether contract owner a had a loss or a gain as a result of our allocation method we will determine what the additional contribution would be worth as of february   we will use the accumulation unit value for the pioneer fund vct portfolio  class i as of february   and assume the new contribution was made into the pioneer fund vct portfolio  class i on june   and compare that result with what the additional contribution is actually worth as of february   in the pioneer equity income vct portfolio  class ii if the value is less we will add the amount of loss to the account value when we move contract owner as contract value from the pioneer equity income vct

governs taxation of annuities in general an owner is not taxed on increases in the value of a contract until distribution occurs either in the form of a lump sum payment a withdrawal or as annuity payments under the settlement option elected for a lump sum payment received as a total surrender total redemption the recipient is taxed on the portion of the payment that exceeds the cost basis of the contract for nonqualified contracts this cost basis is generally the purchase payments while for qualified contracts there may be no cost basis for annuity payments a portion of each payment in excess of an exclusion amount is includable in taxable income the exclusion amount for payments based on a fixed annuity is determined by multiplying the payment by the ratio that the cost basis of the contract adjusted for any period certain or refund feature bears to the expected return under the contract the exclusion amount for payments based on a variable annuity is determined by dividing the cost basis of the contract adjusted for any period certain or refund guarantee by the number of years over which the annuity is expected to be paid payments received after the investment in the contract has been recovered ie when the total of the excludable amounts equals the investment in the contract are fully taxable the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates for certain types of qualified plans there may be no cost basis in the contract within the meaning of section  of the code resulting in the annuity payments being fully includable in taxable income owners annuitants and beneficiaries under the contracts should seek competent financial advice about the tax consequences of any distributions safeco is taxed as a life insurance company under the code for federal income tax purposes the separate account is not a separate entity from safeco and its operations form a part of safeco diversification section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable annuity contracts the code provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period and any subsequent period for which the investments are not in accordance with regulations prescribed by the united states treasury department treasury department adequately diversified disqualification of the contract as an annuity contract would result in imposition of federal income tax to the owner with respect to earnings allocable to the contract prior to the receipt of payments under the contract the code contains a safe harbor provision which provides that annuity contracts such as the contracts meet the diversification requirements if as of the end of each quarter the underlying assets meet the diversification standards for a regulated investment company and no more than fiftyfive percent  of the total assets consist of cash cash items us government securities and securities of other regulated investment companies on march   the treasury department issued regulations treas reg  which established diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts such as the contracts the regulations amplify the diversification requirements for variable contracts set forth in the code and provide an alternative to the safe harbor provision described above under the regulations an investment portfolio will be deemed adequately diversified if  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any one investment  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any two investments  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any three investments and  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any four investments the code provides that for purposes of determining whether or not the diversification standards imposed on the underlying assets of variable contracts by section h of the code have been met each united states government agency or instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer safeco intends that all portfolios of the trust and the funds underlying the contracts will be managed in such a manner as to comply with these diversification requirements  pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the treasury department has indicated that the diversification regulations do not provide guidance regarding the circumstances in which owner control of the investments of the separate account will cause the owner to be treated as the owner of the assets of the separate account thereby resulting in the loss of favorable tax treatment for the contract at this time it cannot be determined whether additional guidance will be provided and what standards may be contained in such guidance the amount of owner control which may be exercised under the contract is different in some respects from the situations addressed in published rulings issued by the internal revenue service in which it was held that the policy owner was not the owner of the assets of separate account it is unknown whether these differences such as the owners ability to transfer among investment choices or the number and type of investment choices available would cause the owner to be considered as the owner of the assets of the separate account resulting in the imposition of federal income tax to the owner with respect to earnings allocable to the contract prior to receipt of payments under the contract in the event any forthcoming guidance or ruling is considered to set forth a new position such guidance or ruling will generally be applied only prospectively however if such ruling or guidance was not considered to set forth a new position it may be applied retroactively resulting in the owner being retroactively determined to be the owner of the assets of the separate account due to the uncertainty in this area safeco reserves the right to modify the contract in an attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment multiple contracts the code provides that multiple nonqualified annuity contracts which are issued within a calendar year to the same contract owner by one company or its affiliates are treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the tax consequences of any distribution such treatment may result in adverse tax consequences including more rapid taxation of the distributed amounts from such combination of contracts
