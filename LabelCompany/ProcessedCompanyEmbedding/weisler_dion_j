weisler newly named ceo of the forthcoming hp inc courtesy hewlettpackardhewlettpackardwho is dion weislerkatherine noyesoct  keep your friends close and your enemies closer has long been a guiding rule in the military and corporate worlds it also helps explain the choice of dion weisler to lead hp inc the printer and personal computer business that hewlettpackard hpq plans to split off next year currently executive vice president of hp’s printing and personal systems business weisler spent many years at acer and lenovo—the latter arguably hps most formidable competitor in the pc business today for hp inc its important to keep that knowledge inhouse as it sets out on its owntheres little doubt weisler  is going to need every advantage he can get in his upcoming new role pc shipments are on a downward trend margins are slim and lenovo has been padding its lead as the no  vendor with hp trailing behind hps lacking strength in mobile technologies only adds to the pressurethe choices that dion makes over the next few years will be critical to hp’s longterm success in the pps space says crawford del prete chief research officer at idc the market research firm they can’t afford to overprovision the market with various devices yet at the same time we think they need to expand in their ability to provide a more holistic experience to managing the mobile experiencerelatedfortune meg whitman cedes one of her hpe titles to this execfortune meg whitman cedes one of her hpe titles to this execbefore taking on his current role australiaborn weisler served as senior vice president and managing director of hps printing and personal systems group for the asiapacific and japan region weisler is credited with helping to turn acer into a firm that scared the other oems half to death says rob enderle principal analyst with enderle group weisler is also seen as instrumental to lenovo’s success in the category at hp he turned the pc unit from a liability into an asset in a few short months enderle saysweislers international experience is one of his greatest strengths stephen nigro senior vice president of hps inkjet and graphics business told fortune he also has a lot of experience in managing businesses in multiple product categories personally hes a very detailed and factbased sort of individual also he likes to win you want someone leading who wants to win and has competitive fireweisler who holds a bachelors degree in computing from australias monash university is famous for using surfing analogies to describe his strategic vision nigro says he has long been an avid swimmer and used to swim competitively dion is very engaging and has brought a refreshing sense of energy and enthusiasm to hp pps says bryan ma an idc analyst in singapore ma says he knew weisler in his lenovo days as well as his time at hp covering the asiapacific regiona breath of fresh air is how former hp executive charles house describes weisler house coauthor of the hp phenomenon innovation and business transformation and now executive director at innovascapes institute says he met weisler earlier this year at a private training session for hp executives at a stanford graduate business school workshophe has a keen wry sense of humor house says he believes in creativity and actually seems to understand it he exudes a high ethical standard—something for which former ceo mark hurd and former pc chief todd bradley were polar opposites and he seems selfconfident but not arrogant he decidedly did not convey a macho attitude—just a quietmannered confidencefor idcs del prete what is most impressive about weisler is what he has not done hes kept the product strategy very focused developing some products just for specific countries—for example phones in india del prete says this focus is very important as hp thinks about how it evolves in the client spaceweislers deep understanding of the supply chain will be very useful in his new position—particularly given the pc industrys thin margins says bob odonnell founder and chief analyst at technalysis research indeed in terms of knowledge and experience weisler will be hard to beat says charles king principal analyst at punditweisler is already thought to be one of the best pc executives in the industry enderle says he could have a massive hit if he can get hp’s potentially marketleading highspeed d printer to marketmobility is another matter phones tablets perhaps even wearable devices—all are challenges that hp has yet to successfully address as we all know mobility is much more than just devices and dion seems to recognize that ma says but in almost all of my discussions with hp pps their response to mobility is still very devicecentric in fact it’s hp’s enterprise services team that seems to be in a better position to transform businesses so i’m watching to see how hp inc will either build or partner with others—including hewlettpackard enterprise—on how to deliver an endtoend solution rather than just talking about tablets like it does todaybut thats part of the job weislers new role certainly isnt a position for the faint of heart king says if he succeeds the it industry will be talking about it for years to comecustomer servicesite mapprivacy policyadvertisingad choicesterms of useyour california privacy rightscareers  time inc all rights reservedall products and services featured
