opportunities contact us our worldwide network about us press room other worldwide markets doing business in korea at first glance korea appears to be just like any other nation  its capital city seoul is a modern thriving metropolis with all of the latest technology the world has to offer  all over korea youll find firstclass telecommunications the requisite fivestar hotels western restaurants modern transport systems including very efficient subway networks in seoul and busan innovative architecture and so forth nonetheless it is still very korean and it is imperative that any american doing business in korea realizes that seoul is not los angeles even though the latter in fact has a sizeable korean community  every year korea becomes more and more modern but it is important to recognize that modern does not equal western  koreans will not expect you to be an expert on the nuances of their culture but they will appreciate a show of interest in matters that are important to them  koreans generally appreciate a foreigners effort in expressing a thank you gamsahamnida or a hello anyonghasayyo in the korean language though koreans have transitioned greatly into western society the traditional ways of thinking in many areas are still practiced  koreans have a great respect for the family and hierarchy  extended families ie parents living with middleaged married “children” and their grandchildren are still commonplace although this is rapidly changing  among the older generation the father is the primary wage earner while the mother stays at home  due to changing social mores and economic pressures the necessity for families to have double incomes is rapidly growing in korea  although fathers are the primary income earners in the majority of cases salaries are entrusted to their wives and most daytoday consumption decisions are at the discretion of the female spouse  us companies may wish to take into consideration these traditional family roles when marketing to korean consumers even though there are incremental changes in korean attitudes and women are making progress women professionals at the highest levels are still very rare  in korean companies the majority of working women many with top university degrees are still relegated to secretarial jobs accounting or educational work many qualified women welcome the opportunity to work as a professional with a foreign company whose attitudes toward gender equality and professional respect and responsibility prevail koreans still have a great respect for anyone senior in age and intuitively establish their hierarchical position relative to others based on age  indeed one of the fundamental principles of the korean language is based on the plethora of verb endings which indicate the level of respect accorded to another person  in addition a man generally receives more respect in the business world than a woman though foreign businesswomen especially nonasian looking women are accorded almost an equal amount of respect as foreign businessmen  single women generally receive less respect than married women whose ties to their husband oftentimes establish their position in society  the american businessperson as a foreigner is generally exempt from the above societal classification system although one should be prepared to answer questions that koreans may regard as common to establish societal hierarchy but which foreigners may regard as personal such as questions about age and marital status americans should be ready to mix business with social life as the koreans base their business relationships on personal ones  the heavy drinking of the korean alcohol soju beer scotch or other liquor is commonplace in establishing a personal business relationship  also commonplace is the noraebang where a group of businesspeople go to an establishment to drink and sing along to a video machine playing music  as most noraebang machines come equipped with songs in english a businessperson may want to be prepared to sing at least one song in order to gain social favor with their korean counterpart  although not as common as the noraebang businessmen should also be aware of “room salons” where korean women serve food and drink to their patrons when doing business americans should be sensitive to koreas historical relationship with japan which made a virtual colony of the korean peninsula  because of the japanese colonial period koreans have an emotionally intense reaction at times to things japanese though there is an admiration for japanese business acumen  a businessperson should show great respect towards korean society  any comparative mention of japan versus korea where japan has the upper edge may harm a business deal korea still observes confucian ethics based on strong ties to a group  whereas an american may think in individual terms ie what is in my best interest a korean frequently thinks in group terms ie what is in the best interests of the group and how can i help to maintain harmony within the group  for this reason the majority of koreans are intensely patriotic calling korea by the term oorinara our country  in order to close a deal when negotiating the benefits for the group whether for the company or country should be emphasized for koreans relationships are all important  cold calls dont work and introductions are crucial  koreans want to do business with people with whom they have formed a personal connection or whereby a mutual intermediary has made an introduction  as alumni contacts are a major source of networking in korea a particularly wellconnected korean will have attended a prestigious korean university such as seoul national university yonsei university korea university or ehwa women’s university the exchange of business cards is very important and a means by which koreans learn about the name position and status of the other person  koreans observe a very strict hierarchical code whereby koreans will generally meet to discuss business with persons of the same parallel rank  businesspersons should always have their preferably bilingual business cards ready and should treat the exchange of a korean counterparts card with respect it is a sign of respect to receive and present items with both hands followed in business etiquette by passing and receiving a card with the right hand  one should never give a card or anything else for that matter with the left hand as it shows disrespect  for historical reasons chinese characters which koreans can generally understand are regarded as more sophisticated  as such a business card written in chinese characters can serve for a business trip to korea china and japan negotiating style is particularly important  koreans can prove subtle and effective negotiators and a commitment to a rigid negotiating stance early on may work to the americans disadvantage  your offer may include the best price technology and profit potential but still be turned down because the korean customer does not like your style an important point to keep in mind concerns the nature of reaching an agreement with a korean firm  westerners attach great importance to a written contract that specifies each detail of the business relationship  koreans on the other hand value a contract as a loosely structured consensus statement that broadly defines what has been negotiated but leaves sufficient room to permit flexibility and adjustment  the korean government has attempted to address this dual perception by formulating model contracts for licensing technology and other arrangements  both parties must be assured that the obligations spelled out in a negotiated contract are fully understood most koreans have three names  these names usually follow the chinese pattern of a surname followed by two given names  in a korean household all brothers and sisters have the same last name and a common given name the only distinguishing mark is the remaining given name  in addressing koreans foreigners should observe the use of surnames eg mr kim ms lee using formal titles if possible eg dr yoo director song the most common last names are kim lee and park  in the use of formal titles as appropriate one should always be familiar with the complete name including the two given names for identification purposes as there may be several mr parks or dr lees in the same company and even the same work space see how the us commercial service can help you sell your products in korea by going to our

correspondent banks project financing web resources methods of payment the korean financial system is frequently hardpressed to meet the demand for financing and capital for international commercial transactions this is mainly attributed to banks holding bis bank for international settlement reserves capital adequacy ratios above the  percent required and to being stricter on loan requirements for smes and small businesses given significant personal household debt foreign companies in startup operations with a korean partner often need to invest financial resources for the joint venture while their korean partner makes inkind investments ie land or facilities for their share of equity jointventure companies and foreign firms often work with branches of foreign banks for localcurrency financing although the branches of foreign banks control a small portion of available korean won sources of korean won financing have included domestic commercial banks regional banks and specialized banks including the korea development bank the national agricultural cooperative federation the industrial bank of korea ibk and the korea housing bank korea’s major international banks offer services for all types of international trade payment methods when you engage in business activities with a customer overseas knowing how to collect payment on an overseas sales transaction is the single most critical factor for sme business owners who aspire to expand their international business operations common overseas payment methods include sight and deferred payment letters of credit lc documents against acceptance da and documents against payment dp and open account transactions da and lcs are forms of extended credit in which the importer makes no payment for the goods until the date called for in the lc dp is similar to da except that the importer cannot clear the goods from customs prior to making payment in some cases an importer can clear goods prior to payment under a sight lc lc transactions generally follow standard international uniform customs and practice ucp codes cs korea recommends that us companies consider dealing on a confirmed lc credit basis with new and even familiar customers a confirmed lc through a us bank is recommended because it prevents unwanted changes to the original lc and it places responsibility for collection on the banks rather than on the seller once a business relationship has strengthened over time use of payment mechanisms other than lcs can be employed for more extensive details on international payment methods please see

financing pf is designed to facilitate funding of largescale projects the concept was first introduced in korea to finance a highway construction project between seoul and the incheon international airport the governments decision to introduce this financing technique was prompted by the need to boost domestic demand by stimulating investments in largescale projects including housing construction and social infrastructure facilities most of korea’s social overhead capital soc projects are funded through pf pf is also used for the financing of private sector projects to include real estate development and buyouts of financially troubled companies several korean and foreign banks provide pf and offer venture capital investment programs for social infrastructure projects private projects and smes in korea these banks support companies through direct equity investments although domestic companies generally have access to local funding as well as to informal and secondary financial markets charging higher interest rates debentures are also used as a financing alternate although slightly more expensive than bank financing finally financing in the form of longterm debt is available from the korea development bank kdb but generally for high priority industries in january  the staterun exportimport bank of korea kexim announced that it will provide a
