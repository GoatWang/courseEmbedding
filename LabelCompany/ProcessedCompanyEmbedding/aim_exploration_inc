inc shares the latest anthracite analysis  strong positive results positive lab results on anthracite press release  oct   henderson nv october   newswirecom  aim exploration inc otcbb aexe otc aexe aim exploration receives latest anthracite analysis  strong positive results proving high grade anthracite extracted from the existing tunnels within the  hectare peru mining concessions aim exploration had samples of coal extracted from their mining concessions delivered to the world renowned sgs labs mineral services for evaluation and confirmation of the quality of the coal the analysis consists of a fully comprehensive report where the technicians test the coal finding the chemical composition to a  degree of accuracy for more information on sgs labs see httpwwwsgscaenenergyaspx the findings were broken down into a rigorous series of tests specifically for coal  tests for percentage elemental composition and  major classification coverage tests the results prove that the coal is high grade anthracite with energy output of  kilocals per kilogram which is in the range for high heat burning anthracite the detailed results are attached to this press release and shared as either image format or pdf format so that all of our audience can easily review it please look at the supplemental images below for links to the jpg of pdfs of the granular sgs lab results for our audience astm international is an international standards organization that develops and publishes voluntary consensus technical standards for a wide range of materials products systems and services some  astm voluntary consensus standards operate globally source httpsenwikipediaorgwikiastminternational in the tables attached as images nd denotes not detected highlights from the extensive lab survey are as follows all of the tests performed have results that are indicative of highgrade anthracite the summary of the  page scientific report little moisture of  ash is  denoting clean wastage and most importantly is the energy output of  kilocals per kilogram which is in the range for high heat burning anthracite the hgi is  which is an index of hardness where  is hard and  is the softest httpwwwsgscaenenergyenergysourcescoalcoalanalysishardgrovegrindabilityindexhgiaspx anthracite is also called hard coal although its composition is mostly dense carbon of  or higher being that it is not used for thermal coal the density of carbon and low ash and low moisture amounts are good for industrial usage to produce high grade steel and water purification with the least amount of output impurities contrasting to the lower grade coals lignite and bituminous and coking coal anthracite as specified in the external source httpwwwchemicallandcompetrochemicalanthracitehtm where it states that it is nearly pure carbon is very hard black and lustrous and burns with a clean flame and little smoke or odor the moisture content is not more than  percent and the heat value ranges is from  to  million btu per ton on a dry basis the significance of the lab results shows that the mine property in peru contains high value anthracite coal  carbon density we are very excited about these findings because the demand for anthracite coal is growing and aim exploration is fully invested to provide anthracite coal to the world says jr todhunter president and ceo of aim exploration todhunter further went on to say that our highly positive lab test results makes us proud to have an ecologically responsible mineral with a high carbon content  that can be applied to industrial uses worldwide the anthracite studies of importexport show that north america asia india and china and the middle east have positive demand for anthracite coal and are linearly proportional to their output for high grade quality steels and high precision steel products external  reports show that we are net  growth in anthracite usage worldwide this is cited in the anthacite market survey online at httpwwwresourcenetcomrsnuploadsfilessamplepdf on page  illustrated in the table below as an image link the sulphur content in our report is low where sgs labs show nd  not detected  which is an indication of clean product output when burning the coal see column f at  carbon we feel that our product is highly desirable in all markets in the world see column c anthracite has a composition between  to  so we are well within the range of high quality anthracite says the company httpenopeneiorgwikidefinitionanthracitecoal  in

purpose of propagating the news about anthracite is not intended to be self serving  rather it is to show that we are in an energy hungry era and we need to look for ecologically low impacting energy

for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties many of the mineral resource exploration companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us accordingly these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties in addition they may be able to afford more geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties this competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development this competition could adversely impact on our ability to achieve the financing necessary for us to conduct further exploration of our mineral properties we will also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in junior mineral exploration companies the presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors we will also compete with other junior and senior mineral companies for available resources including but not limited to professional geologists camp staff helicopter or float planes mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs company description we are an exploration stage mining company and we plan to engage in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties and to date we have received no revenues from our operations we have not yet commenced operations and we have primarily undertaken only organizational activities our independent auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern without significant additional financing we will not generate revenues even if our initial exploration program indicates that feldspar or other mineral material may exist on the property that is the subject of our raval claim accordingly for the foreseeable future we will continue to be dependent on additional financing in order to maintain our operations and continue with our exploration activities we are not sure yet if the property covered by the raval contains any substantial mineral deposits or reserves of minerals additional exploration of the property is required before making any determination as to whether any commercially viable mineral deposit may exist we will require significant financing to undertake this additional exploration and currently we do not have plans for obtaining this financing we were incorporated under the laws of nevada effective february   our principal
