are mandated under the clean renewable and efficient energy act passed by michigan lawmakers in  eo programs which electric and gas utilities are required to implement under the eo section of the law are designed to ultimately reduce electricity use in michigan by  percent per year over the next six years according to the act a key goal of the programs is “to delay the need for constructing new

commission expects those who choose to participate in one of these eo programs to reduce their consumption and save enough on their electric bill to more than cover the surcharge because our power supplier wolverine power cooperative has been purchasing renewable energy since  from the harvest wind farm we believe we can meet another mandate of this law that requires at least  percent of our
