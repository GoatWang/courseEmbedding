recovery unfortunately things across the globe are deteriorating more specifically the european economy seems closer to contracting than expanding just recently the european central bank elected to enact policies similar to the federal reserve’s bondbuying program known as quantitative easing if the new measures are adequate and serve to improve the economy that could give lazard a boost in its european business which comprises about a third of its overall revenue competitors lazard continues to grow at an impressive rate despite competing with several different corporations of much larger stature some of these include industry leader blackrock inc blk t rowe price trow and franklin resources ben although lazard operates in a diverse competitive and fastrising industry we believe the company is well suited to deal with the many challenges that lie ahead in fact lazard has been one of the top performing stocks in the financial services industry throughout  and we see that as a sign of continuing investor confidence and strong business results conclusion all told we think investors should take a hard look at lazard ltd the company’s strengths can be seen in its asset management business where it has become one of the leaders in that industry and in its strong financial advisory business moreover we believe that lazard has the ability to leverage its existing infrastructure and wide ranging network to capitalize on the global macroeconomic recovery that could play out in  subscribers interested in learning more about this financial services company are advised to consult

throughout north america europe asia australia the middle east and central and south america our primary business purpose is to serve our clients our deep roots in business centers around the world form a global network of relationships with key decisionmakers in corporations governments and investing institutions this network is both a competitive strength and a powerful resource for lazard and our clients as a firm that competes on the quality of our advice we have two fundamental assets our people and our reputation we operate in cyclical businesses across multiple geographies industries and asset classes in recent years we have expanded our geographic reach bolstered our industry expertise and continued to build in growth areas companies government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective deep understanding of capital structure informed research and knowledge of global economic conditions we believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in the following business segments financial advisory which offers corporate partnership institutional government sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding mergers and acquisitions ma and other strategic matters restructurings capital structure capital raising and various other financial matters and asset management which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations public funds sovereign entities endowments and foundations labor funds financial intermediaries and private clients in addition we record selected other activities in our corporate segment including management of cash investments and outstanding indebtedness as well as certain commercial banking activities of lazard groups parisbased subsidiary lazard frères banque sa lfb lfb is a registered bank regulated by the autorite de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution acpr it is engaged primarily in commercial and private banking services for clients and funds managed by lazard frères gestion sas lfg and for other clients investment banking activities including participation in underwritten offerings of securities in france and assetliability management table of contents our consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments year ended december     financial advisory       asset management    corporate       total       we also invest our own capital from time to time generally alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors in alternative investments or private equity investments and since  we have engaged in a number of alternative investments and private equity activities including investments through i the edgewater funds edgewater our chicagobased private equity firm see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements ii lazard australia corporate opportunities fund  cof a lazardmanaged australian fund targeting australasian midmarket investments iii a mezzanine fund which invests in mezzanine debt of a diversified selection of smallto midcap european companies and iv a fund targeting significant noncontrollingstake investments in established private companies we also make investments to seed our asset management strategies we may explore and discuss opportunities to expand the scope of our alternative investment and private equity activities in europe the us and elsewhere these opportunities could include internal growth of new funds and direct investments by us partnerships or strategic relationships investments with third parties or acquisitions of existing funds or management companies in the third quarter of  we entered into arrangements with lfcm holdings llc which is now known as lmdc holdings llc lmdc holdings and continues to be owned in large part by former and current managing directors of lazard including our executive officers and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to the arrangements among other things i we acquired certain assets from lmdc holdings relating to its convertible securities business ii the business alliance provided for in the business alliance agreement dated as of may   between the company and lmdc holdings terminated and iii lmdc holdings relinquished certain license rights previously granted under the license agreement dated as of may   between the company and lmdc holdings in addition lmdc holdings surrendered certain leasehold interests including leasehold improvements to the company and was relieved of obligations to pay related sublease rent see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements we do not believe that any of these arrangements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations the acquired assets facilitate the execution of exchange offers and other transactions related to financial advice provided by our capital advisory and convertible securities practice groups in addition we have taken steps that will enable us to act as an underwriter in public offerings and other distributions of securities from time to time in order to buttress our financial advisory business business environment and outlook economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance as described above our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our financial advisory and asset management business segments as our financial advisory revenues are primarily dependent on the successful completion of merger acquisition restructuring capital raising or similar transactions and our asset management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of assets under management aum weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for ma and capitalraising activity as well as our asset management business but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business despite some market volatility in the fourth quarter of  equity market indices for developed markets at december   increased as compared to such indices at december   with us markets generally outpacing european markets emerging markets indices at december   generally decreased as compared to december   in the global ma markets during  the number and value of all completed ma table of contents transactions increased as compared to the same period in the prior year as did the subset of such transactions involving values greater than  million during the same time the number and value of all announced ma transactions including the subset of such transactions involving values greater than  million also increased reflecting an active global ma environment during  global restructuring activity remained low consistent with the last several years entering  corporate cash balances remain high and the outlook for interest rates remains low the us macroeconomic environment has improved but europe and many of the developing markets remain unsettled volatility has returned to the capital markets but the underpinnings of the usled global economic recovery appear to remain in place although market volatility may continue the longerterm trends appear to remain favorable for both of our businesses we intend to leverage our existing infrastructure to capitalize on any global macroeconomic recovery positive momentum in the ma cycle and strength in the global equity markets we expect to generate revenue growth by remaining adequately staffed to capitalize on any macroeconomic recovery and deploying our intellectual capital to generate new revenue streams our outlook with respect to our financial advisory and asset management businesses is described below financial advisory  the fundamentals for continued growth of a strategic ma cycle appear to remain in place demand continues for expert independent strategic advice that can be levered across geographies and our range of advisory capabilities the global scale and breadth of our financial advisory business allows us to advise on large complex crossborder transactions across a variety of industries in addition we believe our businesses throughout the emerging markets japan and australia position us for growth in these markets while enhancing our relationships with and the services that we can provide to clients in developed economies asset management  generally we have seen increased investor demand across regions and investment platforms in the short to intermediate term we expect most of our growth will come from defined benefit and defined contribution plans in the developed economies because of their sheer scope and size over the longer term we expect an increasing share of our aum to come from the developing economies in asia latin america and the middle east as their retirement systems evolve and individual wealth is increasingly deployed in the financial markets our global footprint is already well established in the developed economies and we expect our business in the developing economies will continue to expand given our globally diversified platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients we believe we are positioned to benefit from growth that may occur in the asset management industry we recently extended the global footprint of our asset management business by opening new offices in zurich singapore dubai and dublin we are continually developing and seeding new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms recent examples of growth initiatives include the following investment strategies emerging markets debt emerging markets small cap equity real estate managed volatility strategies middle east north african equities asian equities us longshort equity and international concentrated equity we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks and uncertainties emerge continuously and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements see item a risk factors in this form k furthermore net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of fullyear results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter overall we continue to focus on the development of our business including the generation of stable revenue growth earnings growth and shareholder returns the prudent management of our costs and expenses the efficient use of our assets and the return of capital to our shareholders table of contents certain data with respect to our financial advisory and asset management businesses is included below financial advisory as reflected in the following table which sets forth global ma industry statistics the value and number of all

fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of aum and the nature of the aum product mix accordingly market movements foreign currency volatility and changes in our aum product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our asset table of contents management business when comparing periodic results a substantial portion of our aum is invested in equities movements in aum during the period generally reflect the changes in equity market indices our aum at december   increased  versus aum at december   primarily due to market appreciation and net inflows partially offset by adverse foreign exchange movements average aum for  increased  as compared to average aum in  cost saving initiatives in october  we announced certain cost saving initiatives in order to reduce our compensation and noncompensation cost base expenses associated with implementation of the cost saving initiatives were completed in the second quarter of  and were reflected in our financial results these implementation expenses were approximately  million in  and  million in  the cost saving initiatives were intended to improve our profitability with minimal impact on revenue growth while allowing us to continue to invest in our business the initiatives included streamlining our corporate structure and consolidating support functions realigning our investments into areas with potential for the greatest longterm return the settlement of certain contractual obligations reducing occupancy costs and creating greater flexibility to retain and attract the best people and invest in new growth areas the full impact of the savings resulting from the cost saving initiatives was reflected in our  results see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements financial statement overview net revenue the majority of lazards financial advisory net revenue historically has been earned from the successful completion of ma transactions strategic advisory matters restructuring and capital structure advisory services capital raising and similar transactions the main drivers of financial advisory net revenue are overall ma activity the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which lazard focuses in some client engagements often those involving financially distressed companies revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction in addition lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings significant fluctuations in financial advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction restructuring or capital raising activity the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to lazards control lazards asset management segment principally includes lazard asset management llc together with its subsidiaries lam lfg and edgewater asset management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to clients as noted above the main driver of asset management net revenue is the level and product mix of aum which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and to a lesser extent fixed income markets as well as lazards investment performance which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets as a result fluctuations including timing thereof in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on asset management net revenue and operating income asset management fees are generally based on the level of aum measured daily monthly or quarterly and an increase or reduction in aum due to market price fluctuations currency fluctuations changes in product mix or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees the majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of  days or less institutional and individual clients and firms with which we have strategic alliances can terminate their relationship with us reduce the aggregate amount of aum or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons including investment performance changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market table of contents performance in addition as lazards aum includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of lazards aum fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed with higher fees earned on equity assets and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products the company earns performancebased incentive fees on various investment products including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds for hedge funds incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a funds net appreciation in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds the company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined the incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period unless an account terminates during the year the incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback incentive fees on hedge funds are often subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any incentive fees can be earned for private equity funds incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold typically such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a wholefund basis and therefore clawback of carried interest during the life of the fund can occur as a result incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined including any potential for clawback corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the companys seed investments related to our asset management business principal investments in private equity funds and equity method investments net of hedging activities as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with lazard fund interests lfi and on the extinguishment of debt to the extent applicable interest income and interest expense corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of investments classified as trading as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash investments and indebtedness although corporate segment net revenue during  represented  of lazards net revenue total assets in the corporate segment represented  of lazards consolidated total assets as of december   which are attributable to investments in government bonds and money market funds debt and equity securities interests in alternative investment debt equity and private equity funds cash and assets associated with lfb operating expenses the majority of lazards operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees our compensation and benefits expense includes i salaries and benefits ii amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards including a sharebased incentive compensation under the lazard ltd  equity incentive plan the  plan and the lazard ltd  incentive compensation plan the  plan and b lfi and other similar deferred compensation arrangements see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements iii a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and iv when applicable severance payments compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors including general economic and market conditions our actual and forecasted operating and financial performance staffing levels competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation we believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense and the ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue both nonus gaap measures are the most appropriate measures to assess the annual cost of compensation and provide the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation table of contents and benefits expense between present historical and future years awarded compensation and benefits expense for a given year is calculated using adjusted compensation and benefits expense also a nonus gaap measure as modified by the following items we deduct amortization expense recorded for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap purposes in each fiscal year associated with the vesting of deferred incentive compensation awards we add i the deferred incentive compensation awards granted applicable to the relevant yearend compensation process eg deferred incentive compensation awards granted in   and  related to the   and  yearend compensation processes respectively and ii investments in people eg signon bonuses and other special deferred incentive compensation awards granted throughout the applicable year with such amounts in i and ii reduced by an estimate of future forfeitures of such awards and we adjust for yearend foreign exchange fluctuations we also use adjusted compensation and benefits expense and the ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue both nonus gaap measures for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods for the calculations with respect to adjusted compensation and benefits expense and awarded compensation and benefits expense and related ratios to operating revenue see the table under consolidated results of operations below compensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses our goal is for annual awarded compensation and benefits expense to    feb   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage oj simpson made over  while in prison and won’t have

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
