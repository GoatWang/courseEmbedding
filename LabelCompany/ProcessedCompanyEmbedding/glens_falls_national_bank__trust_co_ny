scullin district judge decision and order this matter is before the court on the motion of plaintiff trustco bank national association trustco for a preliminary injunction preventing the defendant glens falls national bank and trust company na gfn from using the mark home town bank the complaint was filed june   alleging causes of action for dilution of service mark pursuant to nygenbus law § d trademark infringement pursuant to § a of the lanham act  usc § a and unfair competition under new york common law gfn agreed without prejudice to discontinue use of the mark until the court rendered its decision on the present motion oral argument was heard on august   in albany new york the court having considered all the submissions and arguments made by both parties denies plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction for the reasons set forth below background plaintiff trustco has provided a full range of banking services to the general public both individuals and businesses for over  years initially trustcos banking services were offered and advertised in the capital district and a few surrounding areas over time it expanded into more surrounding areas opening branches in washington and warren counties according to trustco it has used the unregistered mark home town bank continuously since  on virtually all of its promotional and banking materials and has spent approximately  million promoting trustcos banking services using the mark in  trustco was known as schenectady trust and had no presence in glens falls new york which is located in warren county nonetheless it advertised in newspapers and on television stations that reached into glens falls and the warren and washington county areas and claims its mark was thus wellestablished there trustco registered its service mark trustco bank your home town bank with the new york department of state on july   defendant gfn was founded in glens falls new york in  most of its offices are located in washington and warren counties with a few branches in neighboring essex and saratoga counties both trustco and gfn offer the same services and use the same media for advertising according to gfn it first used the phrase hometown bank in  in the text of an employees quote and has consistently emphasized the hometown flavor of its banking services even when not utilizing the phrase hoy aff ¶  when trustco first opened a branch office in warren county in early  the gfn branch office located nearby began flying a banner that read in part the original hometown bank and placed advertisements in newspapers using this phrase on march   trustco advised gfn of trustcos service mark registration and requested that gfn cease use of the original hometown bank on march   gfn informed trustco that in its opinion gfns use of that phrase did not infringe upon trustcos service mark this action followed  discussion the plaintiffs lanham act claim provides the basis of the courts jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action the purpose of section a of the lanham act  usc § a is to protect competitors and the public from misleading advertising that could result in unfair competition invicta plastics usa ltd v mego corp  f supp   sdny it prohibits false descriptions of products and services and their origins and was meant to prevent consumer confusion about the relationship between a trademark holder and its competitor lois sportswear usa inc v levi strauss  co  fd   d cir  wojnarowicz v american family assn  f supp   sdny  however the lanham act is construed narrowly when unauthorized use of a trademark is for the purpose of communicating a message rather than for identifying the origin of a product or service yankee pub inc v news america pub inc  f supp   sdny preliminary injunction standard to obtain a preliminary injunction a party must show  irreparable harm and  either a a likelihood of success on the merits or b a sufficiently serious question going to the merits to make it a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting preliminary relief jackson dairy inc v hp hood and sons inc  fd   d cir per curiam church of scientology intl v elmira mission  fd   d cir i irreparable harm plaintiffs delay the defendant argues that the plaintiffs delay in seeking a preliminary injunction obviates its claim of irreparable harm preliminary injunctions are generally granted under the theory that there is an urgent need for speedy action to protect the plaintiffs rights delay in seeking enforcement of those rights however tends to indicate at least a reduced need for such drastic speedy action significant delay in applying for injunctive relief in a trademark case tends to neutralize any presumption that infringement alone will cause irreparable harm pending trial and such delay alone may justify denial of a preliminary injunction for trademark infringement citibank na v citytrust  fd    relief denied where plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction ten weeks after learning directly of defendants plans to open a branch office with a similar name and more than nine months after it received notice of same through the press if the delay was caused by the plaintiffs ignorance of the defendants competing service or the plaintiffs good faith efforts to investigate the alleged infringement the delay will not negate the presumption of irreparable harm tough traveler ltd v outbound products  fd   d cir furthermore delay while reasonably attempting to settle the matter out of court does not undercut preliminary injunctive relief american direct marketing v azad intl  f supp  edny the complaint in the present action was filed thirteen weeks after the plaintiff allegedly learned of gfns use of the original hometown bank and six months after the defendants first ad allegedly appeared in the glens falls paper the plaintiff claims the delay included a wait of two weeks for gfns response to trustcos march  letter when it learned that the defendant would not voluntarily discontinue using the phrase the original hometown bank trustco began interviewing assessment and hiring of special trademark counsel to handle this matter the action was commenced within twelve days of retaining trademark counsel including the memorial day weekend the court finds that the plaintiff has not delayed so long as to warrant a finding that  it assumed responsibility for any irreparable injury it may have suffered likelihood of confusion where a mark warrants protection under the lanham act the potential for irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief may be demonstrated by showing that consumers are likely to be misled or confused as to the source of the services in question western publishing co v rose art industries  fd   d cir church of scientology  fd at  a preliminary injunction should usually issue when the use of a mark creates a likelihood of confusion in the consumers minds as to the ownership or sponsorship of a product this presumption exists because damage to reputation is difficult to prove or quantify american direct marketing  fsupp at  as is the amount of profits earned on the infringing item omega importing corp v petrikine camera co  fd   d cir quoted in tough traveler  fd at  in determining whether a likelihood of confusion is present eight factors are considered some of which are also considered in the context of secondary meaning these factors are referred to as the polaroid factors  the degree of similarity between the two marks  the proximity of products  actual confusion  the defendants good faith in adopting its mark  the likelihood that the prior user will bridge the gap between the products markets  the strength of the plaintiffs mark  the quality of defendants products and  the sophistication of the consumers western publishing co inc v rose art industries  fd   d cir polaroid corp v polaroid elecs corp  fd  d cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   trustcos mark home town bank or your home town bank and gfns slogan the original hometown bank are obviously similar both trustco and gfn offer the same types of banking services thus the first two factors at least seem to weigh in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion the court finds however that the remaining factors either weigh more strongly against finding a likelihood of confusion or fail to support the plaintiffs argument that such a likelihood exists perhaps the most persuasive factor on this issue is the defendants intent in using the mark trustco argues that gfns banner raised upon the opening of a nearby trustco branch is evidence that gfn adopted the original hometown bank with a predatory intent gfn however argues that it believed the phrase hometown bank to be nonprotectable it is undisputed that gfn serviced the glens falls area long before trustco and it appears it adopted its new slogan the original hometown bank in reaction to trustcos representation of itself as a hometown bank the court finds that gfns adoption of this new slogan was made in good faith with respect to whether actual confusion exists plaintiff trustco submitted the results of a survey conducted at two shopping malls located in clifton park and albany farley affex a docket   trustco contends that the survey shows the strength of its mark and actual confusion among bank customers of the  people surveyed most attributed both trustcos slogan your home town bank and gfns slogan the original hometown bank to trustco none of the survey respondents were asked about both slogans instead half of the respondents were asked about trustcos slogan the other half about gfns in addition gfn has no branches near the two malls tulley affex a the court does not find this survey helpful in determining the strength of trustcos mark or whether potential bank customers are actually confused the factor of the prior users likelihood of bridging the gap between the products examines whether the prior user may wish to enter the defendants market in the future as trustco has already entered  gfns market this factor is irrelevant see paddington corp v attiki importers  distributors inc  fd   d cir  the sophistication of consumers is often an important factor in trademark because sophisticated purchasers might more easily discern distinctions between products when making decisions about whose product to purchase although trustco claims that both banks serve a significant number of unsophisticated consumers it does not explain how a potential consumers level of sophistication would affect his or her decision in choosing a bank further trustco has alleged that both banks offer the same services and advertise in the same markets thus a potential consumers level of sophistication would not aid him or her in distinguishing between the two banks therefore this factor is irrelevant in the present case finally trustco has made no allegations concerning the quality of gfns services therefore this factor is also irrelevant to the present discussion after carefully weighing the eight polaroid factors the court concludes that the plaintiff has failed to establish that there would be a likelihood of confusion sufficient to cause irreparable harm even assuming the presence of irreparable harm however the court finds that the plaintiff has not succeeded in sustaining its burden of proof as to the second prong of the preliminary injunction standard ii likelihood of success on the merits or a sufficiently serious question going to the merits to make it a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting preliminary relief a likelihood of success on the merits section a of the lanham act  usc § a provides a federal cause of action for infringement of unregistered service marks to succeed on such a claim the service mark owner must show a likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinary prudent purchasers or prospective purchasers would be misled or confused as to the source sponsorship affiliation or approval of the services and  that the service mark is distinctive either inherently or by the acquisition of secondary meaning two pesos inc v taco cabana inc  us   s ct   l ed d   similarly an injunction for dilution under nygen buslaw § d requires the plaintiff to show  that its mark is distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning and  there is likelihood of dilution deere  co v mtd products inc  fd  d cir the court finds that the plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on these two claims because it has not established that the phrase home town bank by itself is sufficiently distinctive or that it has acquired secondary meaning that would warrant its protection as a service mark inherent distinctiveness there are four categories of marks  generic  descriptive  suggestive and  arbitrary or fanciful generic marks are never considered distinctive descriptive marks are also not inherently distinctive but may acquire secondary meaning that makes them distinctive suggestive marks and arbitrary or fanciful marks are deemed to be inherently distinctive without a showing of secondary meaning a suggestive mark is one that requires imagination thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of its goods or services class promotions v ds magazines inc  fd   quoting abercrombie  fitch co v hunting world inc  fd   d cir descriptive marks merely describe the attributes of a product or service and are not inherently distinctive two pesos  us at   sct at  plaintiff initially argued that its mark is suggestive at oral argument plaintiff conceded that the mark may be descriptive but if so it has acquired secondary meaning defendant argues that the mark is descriptive and the plaintiff has failed to  establish secondary meaning the parties have provided little more than argument to assist the court in making this determination professor mccarthy suggests a series of questions courts should consider when trying to determine whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive questions derived from various tests that have been applied  j thomas mccarthy mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition §§   d ed  first how much imagination is required of the potential customer in trying to cull a direct message from the mark about the quality or characteristics of the service is some reflection or multistage reasoning process necessary the more imagination and thought that is required the more likely the mark is suggestive here the court finds that it would not require much imagination reflection or multistage reasoning to infer that by calling itself the home town bank trustco intends to convey a friendly serviceoriented atmosphere the second question is does the mark so closely tell something about the product or service that other sellers of like products would be likely to want to use the term in connection with their goods if not the mark is suggestive here hometown tells very little about the services a bank provides though it does convey some idea of the way services are provided it is likely that other banks would want to use the term in connection with their own services third are in fact other sellers now using this term to describe their products even if a mark is descriptive but has attained secondary meaning if many others in other product markets are using the term the mark may be labeled weak and entitled only to narrow protection here the defendant has shown that other nonbanking businesses use the term hometown in their titles hoy affex q fourth even though the mark may tell something about the goods or services is it just as likely to conjure up some other purely arbitrary connotation if so the mark is suggestive here the court finds that home town bank is not likely to conjure up a purely arbitrary connotation but rather a particular atmosphere or orientation toward serving its customers finally are buyers likely to regard the mark really as a symbol of origin or merely as another form of selflaudatory advertising although the plaintiff suggests that over time consumers in a particular market have come to identify home town bank with trustco it has not shown that these potential customers regard the use of the phrase as anything other than a form of selflaudatory advertising considering all of the above and on the record presently before it the court finds that the mark home town bank is descriptive and thus not inherently distinctive therefore for home town bank to be sufficiently distinctive to warrant service mark protection trustco must show that the mark has acquired secondary meaning secondary meaning determining whether a service mark has acquired secondary meaning involves an examination of the following factors advertising expenditures consumer studies linking the mark to a source unsolicited media coverage of the product or services sales success attempts to plagiarize the mark length and exclusivity of the marks use centaur communications v asm communications  fd   d cir no single factor is determinative and every element need not be proved thompson medical co v pfizer inc  fd   d cir quoted in centaur communications  fd at  the evidence submitted by the parties relative to these factors is as follows advertising expenditures trustco claims to have spent over  million advertising itself as the home town bank in newspapers and on radio and television although these expenditures were indeed large trustco does not explain how its efforts were effective in causing the relevant group of consumers to associate home town bank with trustco see centaur communications  fd at  see also mccarthy on trademarks §   consumer studies linking the mark to a source for reasons already discussed above the court does not find trustcos survey to be helpful in determining whether its use of home town bank has achieved secondary meaning unsolicited media coverage trustco submitted several newspaper articles unsolicited by trustco which link trustco with the phrase home town bank terry affex c however most of the articles which include news stories editorials and letters to the editor describe actions taken by trustco that appear to contradict its claim to be a home town bank unsolicited media coverage was considered in harlequin enterprises ltd v gulf  western corp  fd  d cir to determine whether a romance novel cover format had acquired secondary meaning the unsolicited media coverage in that case described the enthusiasm and loyalty shown by harlequins readers not harlequins use of a particular cover format see also scarves by vera inc v todo imports ltd inc  fd   d cir court considered newspaper articles that indicated a recognition of plaintiff as a designer of a particular product the articles submitted by trustco do not indicate a recognition of trustco as the provider of the type of services one would expect from a home town bank nor that trustco has engendered much enthusiasm or loyalty from its customers  quite the opposite sales success without explaining the connection trustco alleges that it has enjoyed considerable commercial success since it began using home town bank attempts to plagiarize the mark this factor is also referred to as copying of the mark gfns slogan the original hometown bank is obviously similar to trustcos mark and trustco urges the court to accept this similarity as evidence of copying in centaur communications the second circuit looked at whether the defendant publisher of adweeks marketing week had intentionally copied the name of the plaintiffs publication marketing week the court found that it did but based its finding on the defendants failure to provide a credible explanation for the change in the name of its magazine that did not involve copying  fd at  here defendant gfn has offered a credible explanation for using the original hometown bank slogan in its advertisements gfn serviced the glens falls area long before trustco gfn believed the phrase hometown bank to be nonprotectable and used it in a manner not likely to engender confusion among potential customers length and exclusivity of the marks use from the record before it the court finds that trustco has used home town bank in some form longer and more extensively than gfn when trustco was still going by the name schenectady trust the slogan it used in its advertising was the capital regions home town bank usually preceded by trust in us terry reply affex a trustco lists  forms or bank documents upon which its full mark trustco bank your home town bank appears terry aff ¶  further before gfn used hometown bank trustcos reference to itself as the home town bank appears to have been unique in the schenectady albany and glens falls banking markets see terry aff ¶  nonetheless after considering all of the above evidence together and weighing it carefully the court finds that the phrase home town bank by itself has not acquired the secondary meaning necessary to enjoin gfns use of that phrase in its own slogan see generally mccarthy on trademarks chapter  thus trustco is not likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim under the lanham act or its dilution claim under new york law b sufficiently serious question going to the merits that makes it a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting relief the court assumes for the purposes of this motion that a serious question has  been presented that goes to the merits of this dispute and makes it a fair ground for litigation the plaintiff argues that the balance of the hardships that would result from the courts denial of the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction tip in favor of the plaintiff plaintiffs general allegations of hardship include customer confusion dilution of its service mark and harm to its goodwill and reputation mainly however the plaintiff points to the fact that gfn agreed to stop using the original hometown bank pending this courts decision and argues that the ease with which gfn could stop using the mark as opposed to the difficulty trustco would have in doing so is evidence of the balance of hardships tipping in trustcos favor if not allowed to use its mark in warren and washington counties trustco argues it would have to change all of the forms and documents that say trustco bank your home town bank this argument though seems disingenuous denial of trustcos motion will not prevent it from using its service mark it may still continue to use its mark as it previously did on the other side of the equation however the court finds that gfn would suffer hardship if it were enjoined from using the phrase hometown bank to describe the atmosphere it has been attempting to provide to its customers since long before trustco had branches in the area balancing the hardships that would be suffered by either party the court finds that the balance of hardships does not tip decidedly toward the plaintiff wherefore based on the findings above it is hereby ordered that plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction is denied notes  the court finds the capital district to be comprised of schenectady albany and rensselaer counties  located north of the capital district  hudson falls new york  plaintiffs counsel was on the plaintiffappellees brief in tough traveler in spite of presumption second circuit vacated preliminary injunction because of plaintiffs delay of more than a year in seeking injunction  the research firm that conducted the survey also described its findings in conclusory legal terms a
