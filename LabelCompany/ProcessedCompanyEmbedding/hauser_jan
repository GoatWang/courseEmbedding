fabrício andrade on jan    minutes to read micropilot fmr endresshauser launched a new level transmitter the new micropilot fmr we’re here to judge the features and the benefits so enjoy the review and decide what you think courtesy of endresshauser whatcha got there endresshauser offers the radar micropilot fmr with the idea of providing new tech at a similar price to your old ultrasonic level device before we start the review i wanna squeeze in a word on the endresshauser website its quiet “modern design” lacks a primary point of usability by that i mean i couldn’t use my smartphone to access the device information on the site whereisthemanual back to the device i daresay it’s the smallest radar i’ve ever seen be careful you may lose the device just going out to the field just kidding it comes with protection ratings ip and ip a range of up to  meters and an accuracy around  millimeters as a lowcost analog device it can’t support many features for your plant asset management pam system because you don’t have hart protocol builtin furthermore if you want a display you have to get an external option with a ria to show the process information to the operator what can it do endresshauser seems to want to focus on the price point which appeals to a lot of end users radar offers more advantages than ultrasonic and now that the prices almost match why not try it the fmr offers a good compact design and bonus it’s not plain black it even has a bit of color of course that doesn’t really matter but i had to comment on it applepointofview sadly it lacks wireless communication to connect with the control system on the other hand it does have a bluetooth connection so you can access the device remotely and check your data you can download the smartblue app at the app store and google play and best of all it costs nothing to use and test we like companies tossing in software for free thanks mates why should i care if you’re considering an ultrasonic level transmitter consider the fmr too it costs almost the same yet gives you better technology and fancier features improving the quality of the level measurement and your work conditions hey you gotta enjoy it right on the down side the display costs extra but come on with bluetooth access do you really need a display modernity when i downloaded the app onto my smartphone i had to wonder how can you have a nice app with good design and a website that needs a manual to use  i really like the app the envelope curve makes up for it though the procedure to save and send it by email is simple but the demo mode could use some clarity it took me a while to figure out how to turn it off in fact the whole design is simple but at the same time kinda elegant yeah i said elegant the smartblue app offers a good experience overall in general i like the fmr although i long for something disruptive from endresshauser take our poll for more info check out this video on the features of the fmr and
