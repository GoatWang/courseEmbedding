you mortgage needs about our rates  contact us fha loan the difference between an fha and a conventional loan while many people deciding on a loan product in ri ma ct nh vt and me rely exclusively on their lenders recommendation you should understand the basic difference between an fha loan and a conventional loan the term conventional loan includes all loans under the current fnma and fhlmc lending limits some of these may be called conforming a paper subprime and other industry names most people that have heard of fha loans tend to associate them with purchase money transactions while purchases are the most common use fha loans are also available for rate and term refinance loans as well as cash out refinances the main advantage of a fha vs conventional loan is that the credit qualifying criteria for a borrower are not as strict as conventional loan financing and the down payment or equity requirements are also less  to purchase you can put as little as  down in comparing a purchase money fha loan against a conventional loan fha loans will allow the borrower who has had a few credit problems or those with limited credit history to buy a home an fha underwriter will require a reasonable explanation of any derogatory credit but will approach a persons credit history with common sense credit underwriting most notably borrowers with extenuating circumstances surrounding a bankruptcy that was discharged  years ago can be approved for maximum financing conventional financing on the other hand would require  years to have passed to be eligible for consideration also conventional loans rely heavily upon credit scoring you still may qualify for an fha loan even if you don’t meet the minimum score requirements of a conventional mortgage if a borrower does have past credit issues an fha loan may be significantly cheaper than an alternative loan such as subprime these other programs generally have higher interested rate of require a larger down payment or equity position many of these alternative loan products have pre payment penalties where as fha loan do not have such penalties in fact fha loans can be easily refinanced under the streamline program another advantage of an fha vs conventional loan is that fha is one of the few home mortgage programs that allow a borrower to have their down payment gifted from a family member a governmental agency or nonprofit organization this allows home buyers without the necessary money to buy a home today licensed in ri ma ct nh vt and me to determine if you are eligible for an fha loan

construction loan lender terms specify short term duration interim interestonly repayment and loans are due at the end of the construction phase unlike regular mortgages available for   and up to  or  years construction loans have a much shorter life span   months to  years with most commonly  year term construction loan lender terms when the building stage is completed the construction loan lender requires that the construction loan is repaid some borrowers may have difficulties arranging permanent financing at the end of the construction phase if the borrower locked in a single close construction to permanent loan they are at the mercy of the lender unless they find alternative financing and come up with the cash for the construction loan also construction loan terms do not follow standardized rules rather every case is clientspecific and the arrangements may vary greatly it is said that construction loan terms depend on the story of the borrower every borrower in need of such a loan does have a story  interrupted construction financing building a custom house etc the land over which construction is taking place is often considered a collateral for the loan naturally because of the relative short life those loans have borrowers have to be prepared to pay much higher rates on a construction loan compared to a long term mortgage we are licensed in ri ma ct nh vt and

scores have increased year over year but a high percentage of home buyers are remorseful about their mortgage lender selection according to the jd power  us primary mortgage origination satisfaction studysm released todaythe study shows that  of customers purchasing a home express regret over their choice of lender and  of firsttime home buyers regret their choice among customers who regret their decision there are two distinct situationsthe first situation is customers having a poor experience overall scores below  on a point scale which includes an aboveaverage incidence of problems lack of communication and unmet promises while this group’s responses aren’t unexpected they are often vocal about their displeasure making an average of  negative comments compared with the study average of the second situation is more unexpected because satisfaction among these customers is high this group tends to be very pricefocused and frequently obtains multiple quotes among customers who regret their lender selection  indicate they were pressured to choose a particular mortgage product their final lender choice is often linked to financial reasons such as getting a lower rate because they have a relationship with the firm eg checking account with direct deposit“this ‘happy buyer’s remorse’ is in part due to customers feeling that circumstances out of their control drove them to a particular choice and that options weren’t totally clear” said craig martin director of the mortgage practice at jd power “like a lot of consumers they are happy with a good deal but they can feel that they have to jump through hoops to get the deal in the end they may not fully understand exactly what they got and the longerterm risk for lenders is that customers’ perceptions of the deal may change in the future”one potential contributing factor to this condition could be trid tila respa integrated disclosure  over the past two years much of lenders’ attention has been focused on complying with and minimizing the negative effects of these new requirements which became effective in october  lenders have feared that the new requirements would extend an already lengthy process and negatively affect satisfaction while various sources have reported increases in the total number of days for the lending process findings of the  us primary mortgage origination satisfaction study show little change in the perceived speed of the process improved communication and setting expectations appropriately have helped prevent negative perceptions“whether it is a new regulation shifting rates or new technology lenders will continue to face challenges that require them to change” martin said “regardless of what comes if lenders focus on the needs of the customer and execute on key best practices they can positively influence perceptions and minimize the negative effects on customers”following are some of the key findings in this year’s studya higher percentage of customers in
