prolieve technology the prolieve system provides a minute inoffice treatment that combines our microwave thermotherapy capability with a proprietary balloon compression technology to both heat the prostate and dilate the prostatic urethra the purpose of the prolieve system is to provide a relatively painless and effective alternative to drug therapy and certain types of surgical procedures to treat the symptoms of bph the prolieve system consists of a microwave generator and conductors and a computer and software programs that control the focusing and application of heat plus a specially designed balloon catheter and consists of two fundamental elements the combined effect of this “heat plus compression” therapy is twofold first the heat denatures the proteins in the wall of the urethra causing a stiffening of the opening created by the inflated balloon forming a biological stent  second the heat serves effectively to kill off prostate cells outside the wall of the urethra thereby creating sufficient space for the enlarged natural opening in addition the prolieve system’s temperature º c to º c is sufficient to kill prostatic cells surrounding the urethra wall thereby creating space for the enlargement of the urethra opening however the relatively low temperature is not sufficient to cause swelling in the urethra the prolieve is designed with patients’ needs and comfort in mind in general it does not require sedation or postoperative catheterization and provides rapid symptomatic relief from bph bph patients can be treated using prolieve in urologic offices throughout the united states in addition the prolieve treatment is also made available to physicians utilizing our nationwide mobile service provider rocky mountain mobile services medifocus’ strategy to capitalize on the proprietary prolieve thermodilatation platform is to generate revenues through our mobile service and the sale of our disposal catheter kits  our management believes over time

with medifocus inc breast cancer treatment breast cancer treatment the medifocus management team has been working with researchers at massachusetts institute of technology mit who had developed originally for the us department of defense a microwave control technology known as “adaptive phased array”apa this technology permits properly designed microwave devices to focus and concentrate energy targeted at diseased tissue areas deep within the body and to heat them selectively without adverse impact on surrounding healthy tissue in the treatment of breast cancer the apa technology applies the same principal used in the mit’s “star wars” program of detecting missiles medifocus currently holds an exclusive worldwide license to use this technology for medical applications using the apa technology we have developed the apa  breast cancer treatment system intended to destroy localized breast tumors through the application of heat alone or in combination with chemotherapy the company has received regulatory approvals to start the apa ’s pivotal phaseiii clinical trials the company’s goal is to improve outcomes and standards of care in cancer treatment apa  breast cancer treatment system the first indication of use of our apa focused microwave thermotherapy breast cancer treatment system is to treat locally advanced breast cancer labc which involves large tumors that are generally treated first with chemotherapy and then by radical surgery if they do not respond to chemotherapy our technology can significantly improve the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in shrinking large breast cancer tumors improving the chance of breast conservation and decreasing the need for radical breast surgery focused microwaves can be used to shrink breast tumors up to  cm in diameter vastly improving the chance of breast conservation for these patients who under normal circumstances will have no option but to undergo mastectomy labc with large size tumors  cm in diameter represents a large percentage of all newly detected breast tumors in north america the current standard of care soc for labc is to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy to induce tumor shrinkage followed by breast conservation surgery bcs if the tumor shrinks sufficiently or complete breast removal surgery mastectomy if the tumor does not respond currently the rate of successful conversion to bcs is as low as about  medifocus’ focused heat treatment technology has been proven clinically to enhance the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in tumor shrinkage for labc significantly enough to allow breast conservation surgery to become an option rather than mastectomy for a better surgical outcome and a more desirable personal outcome the company intends to expand the indication of use for its apa breast cancer treatment system to include the treatment for medium size breast tumors  cm which is also a large percentage of the newly detected breast tumors the combination of medium and large tumors represents a majority of the total number of newly detected breast tumors how the apa treatment works the breast cancer treatment sector is currently split between chemical or biological agents surgery and devices aimed at killing or removing cancerous tumors medifocus is well positioned to take advantage in all three treatment modalities as demand for procedures resulting in cosmetically acceptable outcomes is growing medifocus’ minimally invasive nontoxic focused microwave technology platform is able to target and treat tumors  –  cm in diameter unlike radio frequency devices or laserinduced thermotherapy additionally the system can be used to eradicate microscopic breast tumors that cannot be seen by surgeons microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation microwaves focused on tumors in the breast result in localized heating of the cancer cells higher water content of the breast tumor relative to the surrounding fatty tissue means preferential heating of the tumor and minimal damage to healthy tissue microwave treatment can result in tumor necrosis induced apoptosis programmed cell death or cell death — and the heat enhances the effects of the chemotherapy drug resulting in tumor shrinkages within a matter of weeks clinical studies have demonstrated that when used in conjunction with chemotherapy medifocus’ patented system can significantly enhance outcome improving the expected tumor shrinkage rate by about  percent when using medifocus’ patented focusedmicrowave technology a minimally invasive disposable catheter sensor is inserted into the breast under ultrasound guidance to provide feedback signals for microwave focusing and temperature measurement the breast is then immobilized by compression which also serves to reduce bloodflow and increase the efficiency of heat delivery for effective treatment and microwave energy is applied to the breast via two parallelopposed microwave applicators a proprietary feedback tracking and control mechanism ensures that the microwave energy is focused on the center of the tumor while a computer algorithm controls the amount of energy applied to the tumor and monitors the temperature to ensure optimum effectiveness additional applications of the apa technology the company also plans to file a supplemental premarket approval pma application to the fda for using the apa breast cancer system for treatment of recurrent chest wall rcw in conjunction with radiation therapy rcw is a recurrence of breast cancer on the chest wall after breast removal and effective treatment for rcw is an unmet medical need the apa has already received a pma as an adjunct to radiation for treatment of surface and subsurface cancer obtaining pma for rcw will expand the market for the breast cancer system to include radiation oncology the company is exploring using heat with radiation for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ dcis an early form of breast cancer that is currently another unmet medical need with no good treatment option the company is also examining the use of focused microwave thermotherapy for nonsurgical ablation of benign breast tumors a widely occurring very painful lesion the future goal for medifocus is to further expand the capabilities of its apa microwave focusing technology platform to develop and commercialize other focused heat

guide to symptoms treatment research and support  updated june   pages  what is sjogrens syndrome sjogrens syndrome is a chronic slowly progressive inflammatory autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of specialized cells of the immune system called lymphocytes tcells in the majority of cases monocytes and plasma cells into the parotid salivary glands and lacrimal tear glands these glands are part of a group of exocrine glands whose secretions pass into a system of ducts that lead ultimately to the exterior of the body this chronic lymphocytic infiltration interferes with the normal function of these glands and eventually results in a significant reduction or cessation in the production and secretion of saliva and tears the condition is named after henry sjogren a swedish ophthalmologist who first described the primary clinical features of this disorder in  in approximately  of patients sjogrens syndrome progresses beyond the exocrine glands and systemic extraglandular features develop two distinct forms of sjogrens syndrome have been recognized primary sjogrens syndrome  defined as dry eye and dry mouth that occurs by itself and is not associated with another autoimmune disorder primary sjogrens syndrome occurs in approximately  of cases according to the sjogrens foundation of america secondary sjogrens syndrome  characterized by dry eye and dry mouth that occurs in the presence of a major underlying autoimmune connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma it has been estimated that up to  million americans are afflicted with sjogrens syndrome and that  of the population in the united states has been diagnosed with sjogrens syndrome however because the disorder may be difficult to diagnose the incidence of the disease may be considerably higher sjogrens syndrome is a condition that affects primarily women with a female to male ratio of about  meaning that about  of people who suffer from sjogrens syndrome are women symptoms of the disorder most often begin between the ages of  predominantly in peripost menopausal women but are also seen in young women in their s and s the average age of onset is  years old the overall prevalence of sjogrens syndrome in the general population has been estimated to range from  to  knowledge is critical when dealing with a lifealtering condition such as sjogrens syndrome if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with sjogrens syndrome its critical to learn everything you possibly can about this condition so that you can make informed decisions about your treatment thats why we created the medifocus guidebook on sjgorens syndrome a comprehensive  page patient guidebook that contains vital information about sjogrens syndrome that you wont find anywhere in a single source the medifocus guidebook on sjogrens syndrome starts out with a detailed overview of the condition and quickly imparts fundamentally important information about sjogrens syndrome including the theories regarding the underlying causes of sjogrens syndrome which include chronic inflammation cellular apoptosis selfdeath of a cell autonomic nervous system dysfunction neurotransmitter abnormality genetic predisposition the classic signs and symptoms of sjogrens syndrome affecting the oral cavity and the eyes the signs and symptoms of sjogrens syndrome that affects other areas of the body known as systemic or extraglandular features of sjogrens which may include sinus symptoms cutaneous skin symptoms vasculitis  inflammation of the blood vessels pulmonary lung symptoms kidneybladder symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms neurological symptoms gynecological symptoms how sjogrens syndrome is diagnosed based on factors such as signssymptoms patient history physical examination and examination of the oral cavity and eyes special laboratory tests that are used to confirm the diagnosis of sjogrens syndrome that are designed to measure abnormalities in the production of saliva and tears understanding the standard treatmentsand the treatment options currently there is no known cure for sjogrens syndrome the major goals of treatment are to control the symptoms and prevent or limit the involvement of other organs of the body understanding the standard treatments  and the treatment options  is crucial for successfully achieving the goals of treatment and thereby enabling the patient to maintain a reasonably good overall quality of life as you read through the section of the guidebook that focuses on the treatments for sjogrens syndrome you will specifically learn about the treatment options that are available to better manage the symptoms associated with dry mouth the treatment options that are available to better manage dry eye symptoms the treatment options for the management of patients with sjogrens syndrome who manifest systemic or extraglandular involvement of other body organs such as the skin lungs kidney gastrointestinal tract or vagina how to better cope with the extreme fatigue that many patients with sjogrens syndrome experience the prognosis outlook for people with sjogrens syndrome and the important factors that can have a significant impact on predicting the outcome important quality of life issues that often confront people with sjogrens syndrome including tips and suggestions for how to better cope with the condition the psychological and social impact of sjogrens syndrome on patients and their families important questions to ask your doctor about sjogrens syndrome a oneofakind reference guidebook on sjogrens syndrome that goes way beyond the fundamentals since  when medifocus was founded weve learned that many people with sjogrens syndrome are seeking more specific

menieres disease is diagnosed based on factors such as signssymptoms patient history physical examination and audiometric hearing studies specific balance tests that are often used to confirm the presence of vertigo associated with menieres disease these balance tests may include electronystagmogram sharpened romberg test dixhallpike maneuver rotational test the stages in the progression of menieres disease from initial signssymptoms to severe incapacitating vertigo attacks and complete hearing loss if left untreated understanding the standard treatmentsand the treatment options because

  medifocus guidebook on acoustic neuromaa comprehensive patient guide to symptoms treatment research and support  updated june   pages  what is an acoustic neuroma the central nervous system is comprised of the brain and spinal cord myriads of nerves run from the spinal cord to all parts of the body in order to gather information from the environment internal and external which is then relayed to the brain one group of nerves is known as the cranial nerves there are twelve cranial nerves but the one of interest for acoustic neuromas is the eighth th cranial nerve called the auditory nerve or the vestibulocochlear nerve an acoustic neuroma sometimes called a vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor that is located on the th cranial nerve which leads from the inner ear to the brain the auditory nerve cells like many nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are wrapped or insulated by layers of specialized cells called schwann cells a gene on chromosome  directs schwann cells to produce merlin a protein which is also called schwannomin merlin acts as a tumor suppressor preventing schwann cells from rapidly dividing in an uncontrolled manner when there is an abnormality or mutation of the gene the merlin which is produced is nonfunctional and this enables the schwann cells to rapidly multiply and form a tumor acoustic neuromas are typically slow growing approximately  mm to  mm per year and can usually develop over a period of years  although growth rates can vary these rounded tumors typically appear as a single mass and are encapsulated at least  of acoustic neuromas are unilateral occur on one side only unlike many other types of tumors acoustic neuromas do not metastasize spread to other parts of the brain or the body acoustic neuromas typically originate at a point on the vestibulocochlear nerve that is located in the internal auditory canal acoustic neuroma tumors may grow for many years before becoming symptomatic they rarely shrink on their own and must therefore be observed carefully and treated after they have been diagnosed the growth rate ranges from no growth or slow growth to fast growing greater than  cmyr the tumor may either consistently follow one growth pattern or may alternate its rate of growth at different periods of time an acoustic neuroma typically remains encapsulated and as it grows it slowly displaces the surrounding tissue and nerves the tumor first distorts the th cranial nerve from which it develops and then may press on the th cranial nerve which becomes stretched over the tumor if left untreated the tumor grows to the point of filling the internal auditory canal and then may grow into the cerebellopontine angle or may begin to erode the surrounding bony structure it takes on a pearlike shape and may begin to press on the th cranial nerve the trigeminal nerve which is responsible for facial sensation although the tumor does not actually invade the brain the pressure of the tumor can displace brain tissue if it compresses brain structures that control vital body functions an acoustic neuroma can become lifethreatening tumor growth rate at one year following diagnosis is thought to be a strong predictor regarding the eventual need for treatment however tumors that are larger than  cm at the time of diagnosis are considered more likely to grow than smaller size tumors in addition an enlarged tumor may press on other nerves and alter facial sensation swallowing and vestibular function such as balance and hearing hearing loss which occurs in approximately  of patients is usually caused either by compression of the cochlear nerve or the blood vessels which supply the cochlea it is of utmost importance for patients who are diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma to be under the care of a specialist health care professionals usually involved in the treatment of acoustic neuroma may include an otolaryngologist neurotologist an earnosethroat medical specialist

deliver focused microwave heat anywhere in the body by way of natural body orifices in fact we already have an fdaapproved product revenue generating prolieve unit for the treatment of bph the second technology we have is external beam microwave that also delivers focused energy it’s exclusively licensed from mit it was used in star wars and we also have a very late stage product in phase  fda studies for the treatment of breast cancer” mr mon begins “the key here is treatment with the two platform technologies that’s fully developed products we can actually develop future products to treat almost any site within the body…and not harm normal tissue especially in the breast cancer technology it’s very unique that we’re able to shrink very large breast tumors with the focus heat and also because of the star wars technology it nulls out energy to normal tissue so it’s focused directly on the breast tumor” when asked about reimbursement mr mon explains “in fact the prolieve unit is
