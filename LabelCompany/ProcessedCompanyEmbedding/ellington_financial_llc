results for the first quarter of  efc had a net loss of  million or  per share including the full impact of marktomarket adjustments said laurence penn chief executive officer and president the loss was primarily the result of a significant decoupling in the latter half of the quarter between our assets and our credit hedges which were—and continue to be—concentrated in short positions in various highyield corporate bond indices for some time now we have been consistently expressing our view that the structured credit markets represent superior value relative to many corporate credit markets—particularly the high yield corporate credit markets more recently we have also been disclosing the adoption of a more defensive position as we have been anticipating possible stresses in the financial system particularly in the credit markets our outlook materialized in the first half of the quarter as the us stock market the energy markets and the corporate credit markets had their worst start to a year since  at the depths of the financial crisis during this earlyquarter selloff our structured credit portfolio widened in sympathy with overall credit markets but our credit hedges were effective in insulating us from the marktomarket effects however this relationship failed to hold in the latter half of the quarter when global equity and credit markets experienced a powerful reversal with a rally that actually outpaced the firsthalf decline many of the structured credit markets did not meaningfully participate in this latequarter rally and as a result over the course of the entire quarter our structured credit portfolio widened while our high yield index hedges tightened thus leading to our loss for the quarter despite the shortterm loss we are very pleased with our progress in executing our longterm business plans our proprietary loan pipelines continue to grow at an accelerating pace as a result in the first quarter alone our portfolio of consumer loans increased by more than  and our portfolio of nonqm mortgage loans more than doubled we continue to resolve and replace assets in our distressed small balance commercial mortgage loan portfolio at a strong pace loan performance in all three of these growth business lines continues to be excellent we also continued to expand our available financing in all three of these areas as we closed on new facilities for both nonqm mortgage loans and distressed small balance commercial mortgage loans and we increased our existing credit lines in consumer loans with yield spreads on our long portfolio having widened and those on our short portfolio having tightened our conviction remains as strong as ever in the relative attractiveness of our overall position we continue to believe that widening credit spreads remain a significant risk and that the yields that we can realize on our structured credit portfolio will ultimately outpace those on our hedges maintaining a disciplined hedging strategy has served us well over many market cycles we are less focused on quarteroverquarter swings and we believe that our hedges will reduce the volatility of our earnings over the long run in light of the significant discount to book value that our shares have traded we have continued to repurchase our shares in the open market including the postquarterend period when we were continuing to repurchase shares under our b plan we repurchased  million of our shares these repurchases were approximately  accretive to our book value market overview volatility was extremely high during the first quarter in the first half of the quarter creditrelated fears stemming from depressed energy prices deepened and caused a flight to quality that spilled over to many other sectors the equity market selloff in the early part of the quarter was one of the worst starts to a year on record led by a severe selloff in the chinese stock market the sp  fell  yeartodate through january th while the shanghai stock exchange composite index plunged  yeartodate through january th credit spreads widened dramatically across most creditsensitive fixed income sectors including new issue cmbs newer vintage clos and highyield corporate bonds especially sectors with direct or indirect exposure to energy prices towards the middle of the quarter energy prices stabilized and what seemed to begin as a relief rally in the equity and creditsensitive markets turned into an outright whipsaw market participants became emboldened to add risk as they increasingly became convinced that in light of the steep market declines and renewed concerns of a global economic slowdown the federal reserve would significantly delay the interest rate hikes that it had previously signaled on march th the predictions of a dovish federal reserve reaction to the turbulent market conditions were confirmed as federal reserve officials both refrained from raising rates and scaled back their predictions of interest rate hikes over the remainder of the year the late february and march rally in most energy markets equity markets and creditsensitive fixed income markets was strong with many markets not only retracing their declines from earlier in the quarter but ending the quarter at higher levels than where they had begun the turnaround during the first quarter was also significantly fueled by continued aggressive monetary easing by several foreign banks on january th the bank of japan lowered its rate of interest on excess reserves from  to  on march th the european central bank or ecb announced in a surprise move that it would lower its benchmark rate to zero and that it would increase the pace of its monthly bond purchases in its quantitative easing program from € billion a month to € billion a month the ecb also announced that it would begin buying investmentgrade eurodenominated corporate bonds to help combat weak growth and deflation this raised expectations of a liquidity squeeze and much tighter yield spreads in the european corporate bond markets interest rates fell sharply in the first half of the quarter in response to the flight to quality but only rebounded slightly for the remainder of the quarter in light of the dovish signals and actions by central banks over the course of the entire quarter the year us treasury yield fell  basis points to end at  and the year us treasury yield fell  basis points to end at  the year interest rate swap spread became more negative tightening  basis points to end the quarter at  basis points since a significant portion of our interest rate hedging portfolio is comprised of interest rate swaps this negatively impacted our results for the quarter the average rate for a fixed rate year conventional mortgage also decreased over the course of the first quarter falling  basis points to end the quarter at  credit our credit strategy generated a gross loss of  million for the first quarter or  per share this strategy includes nonagency rmbs cmbs performing subperforming and nonperforming residential and commercial mortgage loans consumer loans clos investments in mortgagerelated entities distressed corporate debt and equity interest rate hedges credit hedges including relative value trades involving credit hedging instruments and our equities trading strategy the first quarter loss from our credit strategy was primarily driven by losses on our net credit hedges and other activities net interest rate hedges net realized and unrealized losses on investments interest expense and other investment related expenses partially offset by interest income and other income during the first quarter we turned over approximately  of our credit bond portfolio as measured by sales excluding paydowns active portfolio trading is a key component of our strategy and we trade our bond portfolio not only for the generation of total return but also to enhance the composition of our portfolio as of march   our total long credit portfolio excluding derivatives was essentially unchanged at  million as compared to  million as of december   over the course of the first quarter we net sold nonagency rmbs but increased our investments in consumer loans and nonqm residential mortgage loans our consumer loan strategy our commercial mortgage strategy our residential mortgage loan strategy and our equities trading strategy each contributed positively to our results for the quarter while our credit hedges including relative value trades involving credit hedging instruments net interest rate hedges distressed debt and equity investments and our investments in mortgage originators served as a drag on our results we implement our equities trading strategy generally through the use of total return swaps and their contribution to our results is included in our summary operating results under the caption net credit hedges and other activities the nonagency rmbs market followed a similar path to that of most other creditsensitive fixed income sectors in that yield spreads widened significantly in the early part of the quarter and then abruptly reversed course and tightened significantly in the latter part of the quarter however nonagency rmbs yield spreads ended the quarter noticeably wider than where they had begun nevertheless the nonagency rmbs sector performed better over the course of the quarter in comparison to many other structured product sectors such as cmbs in large part because the fundamentals underlying nonagency rmbs led by a stable housing market continue to be strong we net sold nonagency rmbs during the first quarter mainly in order to redeploy the net proceeds into our other targeted credit assets while our nonagency rmbs portfolio currently represents a much smaller portion of our total credit portfolio than it ever has it continues to be a core segment of our overall portfolio we intend to continue to opportunistically increase and decrease the size of this portfolio as market conditions vary as of march   our investments in us nonagency rmbs totaled  million as compared to  million as of december   our credit hedges are primarily in the form of credit default swaps or cds on highyield corporate bond indices as well as tranches and options on these indices and we opportunistically overlay these positions with certain relative value longshort positions involving the same or similar instruments during the early part of the first quarter highyield corporate credit spreads widened significantly but during the latter half of the quarter these spreads tightened and actually ended the quarter significantly tighter than they had been at the beginning of the quarter this reversal was especially the case for highyield corporate indices as compared to highyield corporate bonds which lagged in the fastmoving rally as market participants sought to quickly add long exposure and thus preferred the greater liquidity and depth of the index markets the net tightening in highyield corporate bond index spreads over the course of the quarter led to net losses on our credit hedges we also had net losses on our interest rate hedges as interest rates declined over the course of the quarter our interest rate hedges are principally in the form of interest rate swaps and to a lesser extent eurodollar and us treasury futures we had net losses on our foreign currency hedges which offset foreign currency related transaction and translation gains from our holdings denominated in euros and british pounds we continue to believe that the creditsensitive sectors of the fixed income markets remain vulnerable to potential yield spread widening and so we intend to continue to hedge credit risk in our portfolio using a variety of hedging instruments we believe that our publicly traded partnership structure affords us valuable flexibility especially with respect to our ability to reduce exposures nimbly through hedging both credit and interest rate risks at the same time we believe that any additional substantial yield spread widening will lead to attractive opportunities for us especially given the many diverse sectors in which we are active the cmbs market followed a similar path to that of the nonagency rmbs market with the yield spread tightening in the latter part of the quarter making up much but not all of the yield spread widening in the early part of the quarter recent cmbs yield spread volatility has reduced the pace of conduiteligible commercial mortgage loan originations and this led to lower cmbs conduit issuance in the first quarter conduit new issue volume in the first quarter of  was  billion or  lower than the fourth quarter of  and  lower than the first quarter of  during the first quarter of  our cmbs strategy net of hedges generated modest positive income we had unrealized losses on our long cmbs investments as prices declined although these losses were offset by our net realized gains on securities sold and on our cmbx hedges over the course of the first quarter we sold certain assets unwound some of our cmbx hedges and acquired one new issue bpiece we also rotated some of our remaining cmbx hedges into short positions in highyield corporate credit indices as of march   our cmbs bond portfolio was comprised entirely of new issue bpieces that we purchased at original issuance bpieces are the most subordinated and therefore the highest yielding and riskiest cmbs tranches by purchasing new issue bpieces we believe that we are often able to effectively manufacture our risk more efficiently than what is generally available in the secondary market and to better target the collateral profiles and structures we prefer as of march   our investment in us cmbs was  million as compared to  million as of december   as of march   our portfolio of small balance commercial mortgage loans included  loans and five real estate owned or reo properties with an aggregate value of  million and as of december   this portfolio included  loans and two reo with an aggregate value of  million the number and aggregate value of loans held as well as the income generated by our loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period especially as loans are resolved or sold our distressed small balance commercial mortgage loan portfolio performed very well during the first quarter as certain assets were favorably resolved and others appreciated in value as they moved closer to resolution during the quarter we executed a twoyear financing arrangement with a large financial institution for a subset of our small balance commercial mortgage loan portfolio and as of march   we had  million in borrowings outstanding under this facility we believe that volumes in this sector will accelerate as recent market turmoil may make it more difficult for certain commercial mortgage borrowers to refinance their loans at maturity in sympathy with most other creditsensitive sectors the european mbsabs and clo markets were also extremely volatile during the first quarter with the yield spread tightening in the second half of the quarter failing to fully make up for the yield spread widening in the first half of the quarter while the ecbs announcement that it would begin purchasing investment grade corporate bonds definitely provided support these markets continued to be characterized by a general ongoing lack of activity and liquidity overall net of hedges including currency hedges our european nondollar denominated portfolio generated a modest loss for the quarter during the quarter we acquired our third participation in a package of nonperforming spanish residential mortgage loans we believe that the spanish and portuguese nonperforming loan markets will continue to present attractive opportunities and we are actively pursuing additional opportunities in these areas as of march   our investments in european nondollar denominated assets totaled  million as compared to  million as of december   as of march   our total holdings of european nondollar denominated assets included  million in rmbs  million in cmbs  million in clos  million in abs and  million in distressed corporate debt as of december   our total holdings of european nondollar denominated assets included  million in rmbs  million in cmbs  million in clos  million in abs and  million in distressed corporate debt these assets include securities denominated in british pounds as well as in euros during the first quarter the effect of market volatility on us clos continued to weigh most heavily on more recently issued clos while prices of legacy clos also declined during the quarter—albeit to a much lesser extent—we believe that their riskreward profile has greatly improved as the underlying securitizations have continued to deleverage meanwhile more recently issued clos continued to be adversely impacted by aggressive selling by large banks in advance of quarter end as they contended with the balance sheet limitations imposed by the volker rule within our us clo portfolio we have historically focused on the legacy sector where we have found opportunities in both mezzanine and equity tranches while we have previously avoided more recently issued clos since we believed that they did not provide attractive riskadjusted returns particularly given that the underlying loans were generally originated with relaxed underwriting standards or covenant light features more recently and in light of the significant price declines we have begun to find attractive opportunities in certain recent vintage clo equity positions we have focused our efforts on identifying those securities that we believe have experienced yield spread widening for liquidity reasons as opposed to fundamental reasons during the first quarter our us clo portfolio net of hedges generated a modest loss and the size of the portfolio declined to  million as of march   from  million as of december   we remain active in nonperforming and subperforming us residential mortgage loans or residential npls during the first quarter widelydistributed offerings of residential npls totaled approximately  billion a  decline compared to the first quarter of  offering volumes continue to be dominated by the us department of housing and urban development or hud the government sponsored enterprises or gses and large banks while offering volume from hud has decreased offering volume from the gses each now a program seller has more than offset the impact of diminished hud activity the market for large residential npl pools has remained highly concentrated with the great majority having traded to only a handful of large players who typically securitize the npls that they purchase as a result we have continued to focus our acquisitions on smaller lesscompetitivelybid and more attractivelypriced mixed legacy pools sourced from motivated sellers our residential npl portfolio generated modest income during the first quarter and we held  million in residential npls and related foreclosure property as of march   as compared to  million as of december   although first quarter offering volumes of residential npls declined we expect them to increase in the near term as we believe that certain investment funds hurt by overall credit volatility will become motivated sellers during the first quarter under flow agreements with multiple originators we continued to add to our consumer loan portfolio which primarily consists of unsecured loans but also includes auto loans our us consumer loan and abs portfolio performed well in the first quarter although our credit hedges in this portfolio partially offset gross income earned we expect the contribution from our consumer loan portfolio to continue to increase as the portfolio grows in the first quarter in addition to purchasing loans under our existing flow agreements we began buying loans under a flow agreement with another originator and we continue to actively evaluate other consumer loan originators with whom we may enter into flow arrangements we are financing most of our consumer loan portfolio through reverse repurchase agreements with a large investment bank as of march   our investments in us consumer loans and abs totaled  million as compared to  million as of december   loan performance to date in our consumer loan and abs business has been right in line with our expectations and the growth of the business has exceeded our expectations over the near to medium term and as our portfolio grows we expect to begin financing many of our investments through the securitization market in the distressed corporate debt markets performance also diverged widely between the first and second halves of the quarter by midfebruary the distressed sector of the credit suisse high yield index was down  yeartodate while the distressed sector of the credit suisse leveraged loan index was down  these large declines reversed somewhat in the second half of the quarter as oil price increases lead to a relief rally in the energy sector which spread to a broader based rally across leveraged loans and bonds despite the rally the distressed sector of the credit suisse high yield index was still down  for the full quarter while the distressed sector of the credit suisse leveraged loan index was down  these declines followed the substantial  declines which had been the worst annual declines since  and prior to that  during the first quarter we acquired a few new secured leveraged loans and selectively added to certain existing positions but we have remained cautious and have kept our distressed book small given the weak backdrop we have continued to focus on senior secured leveraged loans and have opportunistically entered into short positions on energy related companies where we deemed it prudent given the historic declines in distressed debt we believe there could be attractive opportunities in this sector in the medium term during the first quarter our distressed corporate debt portfolio including credit hedges generated a net loss as of march   our net long holdings of distressed corporate debt including related equity and the underlying value of loans acquired through total return swap contracts totaled  million as compared to  million as of december   the pace of our nonqm loan purchases continued to accelerate in the first quarter and we are hopeful that our investments in nonqm loans will continue to grow meaningfully over the medium to longer term as of march   our nonqm mortgage loans totaled  million as compared to  million as of december   we also had outstanding pipeline commitments to purchase nonqm mortgage loans in the amount of  million as of march   as compared to  million as of december   to date loan performance has been excellent and the number of states where our origination partner is producing loans for us has increased according to expectations in january  we began financing our nonqm loans under a facility with a large investment bank agency our agency strategy generated a gross loss of  million or  per share during the first quarter of  as interest rates declined we had net realized and unrealized gains on specified pools as both prices and payups increased but these were offset by net losses from our interest rate hedges and other activities consistent with past quarters as of march   our agency rmbs were principally comprised of specified pools specified pools are fixed rate agency pools with special characteristics such as pools comprised of low loan balance mortgages pools comprised of mortgages backed by investor properties pools containing mortgages originated through the governmentsponsored making homes affordable refinancing programs and pools containing mortgages with various other characteristics our agency strategy also includes rmbs which are backed by arms or hybrid arms and reverse mortgages and cmos including ios pos and iios our agency strategy also includes interest rate hedges for our agency rmbs as well as certain relative value trading positions in interest raterelated and tbarelated instruments yield spreads on agency rmbs widened during the first quarter as the declines in yields on agency rmbs could not keep pace with the declines in yields on either interest rate swaps or us treasury securities while payups on specified pools did increase as prepayment protection became more valuable in light of lower interest rates the increase in payups was not enough to compensate for the effects of yield spread widening specifically for the quarter ended march   we had total net realized and unrealized gains of  million or  per share on our aggregate agency rmbs portfolio while we had total net realized and unrealized losses of  million or  per share on our interest rate hedges and other activities over the course of the first quarter average payups on our specified pools increased to  as of march   from  as of december   payups are price premiums for specified pools relative to their tba counterparts during the first quarter we continued to use short positions in tbas to hedge interest rate risk and these positions generated net losses however tbas underperformed specified pools during the quarter and because we hold a net short position in tbas this underperformance benefited our results for the quarter we actively traded our agency rmbs portfolio during the first quarter in order to take advantage of volatility and to harvest modest gains our portfolio turnover for the quarter was  as measured by sales and excluding paydowns and we captured net realized gains of  million excluding interest rate hedges as of march   our long agency rmbs portfolio was  million down slightly from  million as of december   the size of our agency rmbs portfolio remains much smaller than it had been most of last year as we had reduced the portfolio by over  in the fourth quarter of  so as to be generally more defensively positioned in what we perceived to be a higher risk environment our borrowings collateralized by agency rmbs have declined in line with our smaller agency rmbs portfolio size and since these borrowings comprise the majority of our total borrowings our overall leverage has declined as well during the first quarter we continued to focus our agency rmbs purchasing activity primarily on specified pools especially those with higher coupons as of march   the weighted average coupon on our fixed rate specified pools was  our agency rmbs portfolio also includes small allocations to agency reverse mortgage passthroughs agency arms and agency ios we believe that there remains a heightened risk of substantial interest rate and prepayment volatility in the near term thus reinforcing the importance of our ability to hedge our agency rmbs portfolio using a variety of tools including tbas our net agency premium as a percentage of our long agency rmbs holdings is one metric that we use to measure our overall prepayment risk net agency premium represents the total premium excess of market value over outstanding principal balance on long agency rmbs holdings less the total premium on related net short tba agency rmbs positions the net short tba position related to our long agency rmbs had a notional value of  million and a fair value of  million as of march   and a notional value of  million and a fair value of  million as of december   the lower our net agency premium the less we believe that we are exposed to marketwide increases in agency rmbs prepayments as of march   and december   our net agency premium as a percentage of fair value on long agency rmbs holdings was approximately  and  respectively excluding tba positions used to hedge our long agency rmbs portfolio our agency premium as a percentage of fair value was approximately  and  as of march   and december   respectively these percentages may fluctuate from period to period based on market factors including interest rates and mortgage rates as well as with respect to the net percentages the degree to which we hedge prepayment risk with short tbas we believe that our focus on purchasing pools with specific prepayment characteristics provides a measure of protection against prepayments financial results we prepare our financial statements in accordance with asc  financial services—investment companies as a result our investments are carried at fair value and all valuation changes are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations we also measure our performance based on our diluted netassetvaluebased total return which measures the change in our diluted

trended higher across maturities while the repo market has remained liquid widening asset spreads and constrained lender balance sheets have put upward pressure on the cost of repo also possibly adding upward pressure to repo rates was the federal housing finance agencys decision to proceed with its ban of captive insurance company memberships in the federal home loan bank system or fhlb forcing many of the current member companies to find alternative financing however in the latter part of the first quarter and following the federal reserves toned down stance on its likely pace of
