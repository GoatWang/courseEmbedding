by jane haskins esq freelance writer how to transfer ownership of an llc by jane haskins esq september  many limited liability companies have a change in ownership at some point during the life of the business ownership changes happen for a variety of reasons including a member decides to leave the company the existing members want to bring in a new member a member dies becomes disabled or divorces you decide sell the entire business the procedure to transfer llc ownership depends on whether you’re transferring the whole business or only changing the names and percentage ownerships of the members—such as when you take on a new member or buy out a departing member transferring a partial interest in the llc your llc’s owners are called members each member owns a percentage of the business which is known as a membership interest if you want to change the percentage of ownership or add new members you will need to transfer some of your llc’s membership interests they key document that will guide you in how to transfer ownership in an llc is your llc operating agreement you most likely signed an operating agreement when you set up your llc the operating agreement is a contract among the llc’s members that specifies the way the llc will operate if it includes buysell or buyout provisions those will govern the way you transfer ownership alternatively your llc may have a separate buysell agreement the buysell provisions will typically specify a method for placing a value on the business and its membership interests they also might place restrictions on who becomes a member require the llc to buy back shares from a departing member or specify what needs to be done to approve a transfer if your operating agreement does not include a buysell agreement you should check your state statutes for guidance on how to transfer membership interests you may be able to negotiate a buysell agreement or a written agreement to transfer ownership in some states you may have to dissolve the company if your operating agreement does not provide for ownership transfers since these actions can have longterm consequences for your business it’s wise to consult with a lawyer this is also a good time to review your operating agreement and make sure it is relevant and meets your needs now that your membership is changing for example an operating agreement for a singlemember llc may be missing some provisions that are needed for a multimember llc if your old operating agreement seems inadequate you should prepare and sign a new one that reflects the new ownership structure if you don’t need a new agreement you can prepare an amendment that lists the new members you typically don’t need to file anything with the state to finalize the ownership transfer but you’ll want to list the current members as part of any annual reports you make to the state selling an llc despite its name a buysell agreement doesn’t offer guidance on how to sell your entire business to a third party—it only governs the way the members will transfer their membership interests among themselves and new members to sell an llc you need to find a buyer and agree on a price this may involve using the services of a business valuation expert having the buyer examine your business’s books and records or a combination of the two a buyer may want to purchase the entire llc or may only want to purchase its assets selling an llc can have complex financial legal and tax implications so it’s best to consult a lawyer who has experience with buying and selling llcs the terms of the sale may initially be memorialized in a term sheet or memorandum of understanding followed by a more formal contract it’s always best to plan ahead for llc ownership transfers by including buysell provisions in your operating agreement buysell provisions can help a transfer go smoothly and avoid disruptions to your business if you don’t have a buysell agreement or if you want to sell your entire business you may need to seek legal advice for questions or advice on transferring ownership of an llc you can talk to a lawyer through the legalzoom business legal plan get help
