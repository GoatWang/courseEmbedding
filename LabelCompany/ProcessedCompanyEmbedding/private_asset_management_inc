vision statement says we are an independent investment boutique providing advice that is appreciated and trusted by experienced investors in the pacific northwest reviews of our relationships reveal that most clients either live in the pacific northwest or have ties here we serve clients in various locations throughout the us such as vermont new jersey phoenix and palm springs to name a few we are trusted and capable enough to be the primary or sole advisor for the vast majority of our clients we have two major groups clients the larger group either already utilizes their portfolios to support their lifestyles or are close to that phase the smaller group is in various phases of the accumulation process where “retirement” is  years down the road the age profile of those utilizing their portfolios to support their lifestyle tends to be over  we tend to attract the “experienced” investor and not to work with the “ year old retiree” our client’s needs often include a high level of trust collaboration and service a strategy and comfort level that they will not run out of money a desire to minimize taxes the planning for legacy issues we typically serve clients who have  to  million of investable assets and a total net worth from  to  million  we are willing to establish relationships with those who have less investable assets if we can create value and all parties are committed to growing the relationship  we often work with multiple generations of the same family i am concerned about running out of money  how can we address this we believe the best approach is to have a realistic assessment of your current financial condition a handle on your living expenses and then create a sustainable strategy future expected returns may not provide a cushion for poor planning and execution  therefore it is imperative to establish both realistic expectations and a sound strategy from the beginning the “how we work” tab above discusses how we work with you to develop this strategy i do not like paying more taxes than i have to  how can we address this we are sensitive to the fact that taxes are often the single largest expense in maintaining your lifestyle  therefore we are thoughtful when it comes to the ways we can minimize your tax burden we collaborate with you your certified public accountant trustee and business partners as needed we plan with you and your other advisors regarding asset sales ira distributions gifting etc  simple steps can help minimize your tax liability we are careful about correctly holding your assets  if you have both retirement and taxable accounts where a particular investment or asset class is held has a material tax difference  the tax ramifications are very different between family partnerships trusts and retirement plans i currently get my advice from a big bankbrokerage   how are you different our high service model is different because our typical relationship is much larger than what is typical at a bank or brokerage firm  our desire for long term in depth relationships allows us to have different incentives and focus than most firms mike rich and david take the lead in working with you to manage and coordinate your financial affairs  they have over  years of business experience and complementary skill sets  we are geared solely to meet the significant needs of our clients that a typical bank or brokerage client simply doesn’t need we believe our client focus and this comprehensive high touch long term approach is different from other choices you have i have significant real estate holdings  can you help me here yes  mike has an extensive real estate background  many portfolios include real estate investments made by or coordinate by mike mike can apply his experience and knowledge to your holdings  the work could be done on a project or hourly basis  the type of work could include analyzing an offer you have for a current holding helping you work through financing or refinancing options working with you to get a property ready to be put on the market soon or in the medium term calculating your current roi opportunity cost etc to determine if a current holding is worth retaining throughout the process the focus is on maximizing the value of your real estate holding while building a lasting relationship what type of returns can i expect in the future future returns are likely to be modest with many portfolios returning  to  in an environment where inflation is   we wrote a monthly newsletter on this topic in march   to read it click here this has significant implications for planning and execution purposes  no longer can one expect to retire spend and experience a material real return increase in the value of their portfolio  more likely whatever lifestyle you can afford when you stop working for money is the lifestyle you should become accustomed to  improving upon the initial staring point in a low return environment is either not realistic or would require more risk than most can absorb your thinking should be that future returns can help you maintain a lifestyle but will not allow you to make up for poor planning or irresponsible spending one final point is that staring points make a huge difference  some retire at the end of a multiyear bull markets  past returns were above trend  however they extrapolate those returns into the future when the most likely case is for lower future returns simply because of the past bull market can you help me with my taxes and estate planning no and yes  we are not accountants financial planners or attorneys  however we have deep backgrounds in these areas and we do know and work with professionals in these areas who we trust we can collaborate and coordinate any process with these professionals  we do this at least on a yearly basis with many accountants  we can do this on an ad hoc or regular basis with your attorney our goal as with other services we provide clients is to provide you the client with a comprehensive approach to your unique situation and a collaborative process is how we can help you get great advice in areas that are outside our core competencies do you offer insurance products we do not offer insurance products  however as with taxes and estate planning issues we do know insurance professionals who can help you we avoid the conflicts of interest that are common with insurance products due to their often high commission compensation where do you custody assets and how safe are they private asset does not take custody of your exchange traded securities such as stocks bonds and mutual funds we custody these assets at charles schwab you can always “get at” these assets the third party custodian provides you with statements so you can verify account balances and activity we do custody a limited amount of assets due to michael thayer’s affiliation with pam real estate group pam real estate group ii llc and single purpose real estate llc’s how do you charge for your services the objective of our pricing structure is to be fair and to create value most clients are charged on a percentage of asset bases  this varies by asset size and type of asset  we strongly urge clients to utilize us for more than asset management so they do not view the fee or relationship as only an asset management fee or relationship some portfolios are charged a fixed fee  a percentage of assets fee is implied  these accounts usually have liquidity tax or other constraints that limit the account’s strategy and therefore the potential to add value for the client  again our objective is to be fair hourly work is done when appropriate  this usually entails work on client assets not under our direct supervision
