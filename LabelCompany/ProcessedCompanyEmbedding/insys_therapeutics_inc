treatment will be available see warnings and precautions  contraindications opioid nontolerant patients lifethreatening respiratory depression and death could occur at any dose in opioid nontolerant patients acute or postoperative pain including headachemigraine and dental pain or in the emergency department acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in absence of resuscitative equipment known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction including paralytic ileus known hypersensitivity eg anaphylaxis to fentanyl or components of subsys warnings and precautions serious lifethreatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids even when used as recommended  respiratory depression if not immediately recognized and treated may lead to respiratory arrest and death  while serious lifethreatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of subsys the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase  in cancer patients with mucositis exposure to subsys was greater than in patients without mucositis for patients with grade  mucositis the increased maximum serum concentration and overall exposure requires closer monitoring for respiratory depression and central nervous system depression particularly during initiation of therapy with subsys for patients with grade  mucositis or higher avoid the use of subsys unless the benefits outweigh the potential risk of respiratory depression from increased exposure  patients and their caregivers must be instructed that subsys contains a medicine in an amount that can be fatal to a child death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate–release fentanyl products while all units should be disposed of immediately after use partially consumed units represent a special risk to children in the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed of as soon as possible concomitant use of subsys with a cypa inhibitor such as macrolide antibiotics eg erythmycin azoleantifungal agents eg ketoconazole and protease inhibitors eg ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression see warnings and precautions  particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of subsys is achieved  similarly discontinuation of a cypa inducer such as rifampin carbamazepine and phenytoin in subsystreated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions  when using subsys with cypa inhibitors or discontinuing cypa inducers in subsystreated patients monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of subsys until stable drug effects are achieved see drug interactions  profound sedation respiratory depression coma and death may result from the concomitant use of subsys with benzodiazepines or other cns depressants eg nonbenzodiazepine sedativeshypnotics anxiolytics tranquilizers muscle relaxants general anesthetics antipsychotics other opioids alcohol  because of these risks reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate when prescribing do not convert a patient to subsys from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as subsys and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis subsys is not a generic version of other transmucosal immediaterelease fentanyl tirf formulations when dispensing do not substitute a subsys prescription for any other tirf formulation under any circumstances other tirf formulations and subsys are not equivalent substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of subsys compared to other fentanyl products including other tirf formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl as a result of these differences the substitution of subsys for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose subsys contains fentanyl a schedule ii controlled substance  as an opioid subsys exposes users to the risks of addiction abuse and misuse  although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed subsys addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused the potential for these risks should not however prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as subsys but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of subsys along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction abuse and misuse  because of the risk of misuse abuse addiction and overdose see warnings and precautions  subsys is available only through a restricted program called the tirf rems access program under the tirf rems access program outpatients healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program for inpatient administration eg hospitals hospices and longterm care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use of subsys patient and prescriber enrollment is not required prolonged use of subsys during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate  neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts the use of subsys in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated  patients treated with subsys who have significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia or preexisting respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea even at recommended dosages of subsys  lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly cachectic or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger healthier patients cases of serotonin syndrome a potentially lifethreatening condition have been reported during concomitant use of subsys with serotonergic drugs  serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes eg agitation hallucinations coma autonomic instability eg hyperreflexia incoordination rigidity andor gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea vomiting diarrhea cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use more often following greater than one month of use subsys may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients  there is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain cns

obstruction including paralytic ileus known hypersensitivity eg anaphylaxis to fentanyl or components of subsys warnings and precautions serious lifethreatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids even when used as recommended  respiratory depression if not immediately recognized and treated may lead to respiratory arrest and death  while serious lifethreatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of subsys the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase  in cancer patients with mucositis exposure to subsys was greater than in patients without mucositis for patients with grade  mucositis the increased maximum serum concentration and overall exposure requires closer monitoring for respiratory depression and central nervous system depression particularly during initiation of therapy with subsys for patients with grade  mucositis or higher avoid the use of subsys unless the benefits outweigh the potential risk of respiratory depression from increased exposure  patients and their caregivers must be instructed that subsys contains a medicine in an amount that can be fatal to a child death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate–release fentanyl products while all units should be disposed of immediately after use partially consumed units represent a special risk to children in the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed of as soon as possible concomitant use of subsys with a cypa inhibitor such as macrolide antibiotics eg erythmycin azoleantifungal agents eg ketoconazole and protease inhibitors eg ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression see warnings and precautions  particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of subsys is achieved  similarly discontinuation of a cypa inducer such as rifampin carbamazepine and phenytoin in subsystreated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions  when using subsys with cypa inhibitors or discontinuing cypa inducers in subsystreated patients monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of subsys until stable drug effects

as a result of these differences the substitution of subsys for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose subsys contains fentanyl a schedule ii controlled substance  as an opioid subsys exposes users to the risks of addiction abuse and misuse  although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed subsys addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused the potential for these risks should not however prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as subsys but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of subsys along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction

developed by neonatology experts the use of subsys in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated  patients treated with subsys who have significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia or preexisting respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea even at recommended dosages of subsys  lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly cachectic or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger healthier patients cases of serotonin syndrome a potentially lifethreatening condition have been reported during concomitant use of subsys with serotonergic drugs  serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes eg agitation hallucinations coma autonomic instability eg hyperreflexia incoordination rigidity andor gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea vomiting diarrhea cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use more often following greater than one month of use subsys may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients  there is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain cns depressant drugs administer subsys with extreme caution in patients who may
