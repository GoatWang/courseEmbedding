registered as an openend management investment company under act is organized as a series investment company and will be operated as an extended payment fund as discussed below the fund is designed to be a viable and economical means to permit the matthews funds other funds and separate accounts managed by the adviser to invest in china a shares each investing matthews fund other fund or separate account will own all of the interests offered by a particular series and investors in the funds series will be exclusively entities advised or managed by the adviser interests will not be registered under the securities act of  the “securities act” they will be offered only in private placement transactions to “accredited investors” as defined in regulation d under the securities act that are also “qualified purchasers” as defined in section a of the act and the rules thereunder “qualified purchasers” the fund through its series will be the entity that invests in and holds china a shares start printed page   the matthews funds are organized as series of a delaware statutory trust which is registered under the act as an openend management investment company the ucits funds are organized as the separate series of matthews asia funds sicav under the laws of luxembourg the irish fund is organized as a private limited company and regulated as an openended umbrella investment company with variable capital that may be offered and sold only to qualifying investors under the laws of the republic of ireland both the ucits funds and the irish fund are not sold to united states residents are not registered under the act and the offering of their interests have not been registered under the securities act  the adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” the adviser will serve as investment adviser to the fund and its series and serves as investment adviser to the matthews funds other funds and separate accounts matthews global investors us llc “mgi” a delaware llc and an affiliate of the adviser acts as managing member of the fund  applicants state that a significant majority of publicly traded chinese companies list their shares on one or more of three stock exchanges—the shanghai shenzhen and hong kong stock exchanges the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges are located in mainland china and there are two categories of stock that are listed on these exchanges china “a shares” which trade in the currency of china the renminbi and “b shares” which trade in foreign currencies “h shares” and “red chip” shares are listed and traded on the hong kong stock exchange applicants state that far fewer chinese companies have listed their shares as h shares or red chips  the matthews funds and other funds currently invest in china through “h shares” or “red chip” stocks applicants state that for a variety of reasons china a shares are a more attractive means to invest in chinese companies than h shares red chip stocks or china b shares applicants state that while it is not practical or feasible for a matthews fund other fund or separate account to individually invest in china a shares a pooled investment vehicle the fund would allow them to obtain exposure to china a shares the fund will be named as the investing vehicle in the advisers application to obtain a license to invest in china  the fund has a board of directors “board” a majority of which will be comprised of persons who are not “interested persons” as defined by section a of the act each series will have a portfolio manager or team of portfolio managers the portfolio managers for a series are expected to be the same individuals as the portfolio managers of the matthews fund other fund or separate account investing in that series accordingly the portfolio managers will be able to select china a shares most suited for the investors investment style and strategy consistent with the remainder of the investors portfolio as portfolio managers of a series the portfolio managers will have responsibilities to the series and be overseen by the board the portfolio managers also will have responsibilities in their capacity as matthews fund other fund or separate account portfolio managers to the applicable investor for investing the nonseries portion of the portfolio  the adviser may charge advisory fees to the series however if advisory fees are charged to a series used by a matthews fund any assets of a matthews fund invested in that series will not be counted for purposes of calculating the matthews funds advisory fee payable to the adviser so that the adviser will not receive separate fees for managing the same assets except that any such assets will be applied and counted as a matthews funds assets for purposes of applying breakpoints fees paid by an other fund or separate account would be negotiated with the other fund or separate account and structured in an appropriate manner such that unless additional services are provided the adviser would not receive separate fees for managing the same assets fee arrangements for the series will be subject to review and approval by the funds board including its independent members in accordance with section c of the act and their impact on overall fees for the advisers client will be fully disclosed to the applicant client including the matthews funds  expenses of each series which would include basic fees and expenses of service providers such as the adviser administrator accountant local custodian and legal counsel will be charged to the series receiving the services generating the expense and accrued on a daily basis applicants state that because the funds limited liability company agreement does not provide to the contrary the delaware limited liability company act provides that each series holding distinct china a shares will have its own debts liabilities obligations and expenses and such items will not be enforceable against any other series the funds books and those of the series will be accounted for under standard accounting principles and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and they will be audited annually by a nationally recognized and pcaobregistered audit firm in accordance with us generally accepted auditing standards  the funds custodial arrangements will be overseen by the funds board in accordance with rule f under the act the series used by matthews funds will not lever themselves through borrowing but series used by other funds or separate accounts may or in the future may be permitted to use leverage applicants state that the fund will value its holdings daily in accordance with section a of the act and the value will take into account all relevant facts and circumstances including if relevant the length of time before proceeds can be repatriated as discussed below and will be applied under the oversight of the funds valuation committee in accordance with delegated authority and procedures approved by the funds board the fund also has a chief compliance officer and will implement and maintain a compliance program in accordance with rule a under the act  applicants state that access by the advisers clients to the quota ie to china a shares will be a limited opportunity and will be allocated in accordance with the advisers access to research and allocation of portfolio start printed page opportunities procedures “access allocation procedures” which are designed to ensure that allocations are fair and equitable over time to all of the advisers accounts the adviser will amend the access allocation procedures to specifically address issues arising from the quota similarly if more than one matthews fund other fund or separate account seeks to repatriate proceeds at the same time and chinese regulations limit the aggregate amount of proceeds that may be repatriated at any given time to a level below the aggregate amount sought to be repatriated the requests by the applicable portfolio managers will be aggregated if received at or about the same time and proceeds available for repatriation will be allocated pro rata among requesting investors the adviser will not however when making investment decisions for the fund or its series take into consideration whether selling china a shares and repatriating proceeds could impact the continued availability of the quota the adviser will also not take into consideration whether buying china a shares could affect the continued availability of the quota  applicants note that the significant majority at least  of the china a shares to be held by the fund would be able to be disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the china a share market is liquid and thus holdings would meet the liquidity requirements in the context of a funds ability to dispose of an asset however while the china a shares could be sold in a timely manner in exchange for renminbi the investing matthews fund other fund or separate account would only be able to repatriate the proceeds weekly which in some circumstances might not be within seven days of receipt of the redemption request each matthews fund will deem china a shares to be illiquid investments and limit its holdings in the fund to no more than  of its net assets unless chinese repatriation restrictions permit repatriation and the relevant series permits redemption within seven days such that the matthews fund or the adviser in accordance with a matthews funds policies could deem the interests to be liquid under applicable commission and staff guidance  applicants state that the repatriation restrictions may prevent the fund from being able to redeem its interests within the time period otherwise required by the act as an extended payment fund the fund would pay redemption proceeds no less frequently than on one day each month any such date a “redemption payment date” redemption payments would be based on the funds nav on the redemption payment date and redemption payments would only be made for redemptions requested on or before the redemption payment date and time for that particular month or shorter period the fund will adopt a fundamental policy specifying its redemption procedures and this policy will be disclosed in the funds registration statement  the fund will establish and the board will approve written procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the funds portfolio assets are sufficiently liquid so that the fund can comply with its fundamental policy on redemptions taking into account current market conditions and regulatory requirements and the funds investment objectives the board will review the procedures and the overall composition of the portfolio at least annually and on such other occasions as may be necessary in light of changes in the markets for the funds portfolio assets and applicable regulatory requirements concerning among other matters repatriation restrictions applicants legal analysis applicants request an order to exempt the fund from section e of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the fund to operate as an extended payment fund applicants also request that the order exempt the fund from section be of the act and the requirement that the fund disclose a concentration policy regarding investments in any industry or group of industries instead the order would require that the fund disclose that it does not have a concentration policy and require that any registered investment company that invests in a series will aggregate the series holdings with its own holdings for purposes of evaluating its concentration policy applicants further request that the order grant an exemption from sections da and b of the act and an exemption from section a of the act to the extent necessary to permit the fund and its series to sell their interests to and redeem their interests from the other funds a section e of the act and rule c under the act  rule c under the act generally requires a registered openend investment company to sell redeem or repurchase its securities at the price based on the current nav of such security next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption applicants state that rule c was designed primarily to address the practice of “backward pricing” of fund shares that practice involved pricing fund shares for purchase or redemption based on the nav determined prior to the purchase or redemption request this pricing mechanism enabled a funds insiders to engage in “riskless trading” by buying shares at an nav that they knew was likely to increase because of market action after the shares were priced applicants assert that in effect backward pricing created the possibility that some investors could trade fund shares at the expense of nonredeeming shareholders rule c eliminates this problem by requiring “forward pricing” or pricing fund shares at the close of the market after a purchase or redemption request is received under rule c an openend equity fund typically computes the value of shares tendered for redemption on any given day at  pm on that day  applicants propose that the fund will price interests tendered for redemption at the close of business on the redemption payment date which will be no less frequently than one day each month the fund will redeem interests on a given redemption payment date only for redemptions requested on or before the close of business generally  pm eastern time on the redemption pricing date which will be the redemption payment date applicants assert that their proposal does not raise the concern of “backward pricing” because shares will be priced only after a tender for redemption is received applicants state that the funds pricing timeline will be clearly disclosed and is consistent with the act because it will treat all investors equally and not dilute nonredeeming shareholders interests in addition all investors in the fund will be qualified purchasers who are capable of start printed page understanding the risks presented by the funds redemption policy  section e of the act provides that a registered investment company may not suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment or satisfaction upon redemption of any redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after the tender of the security to the company applicants state that the redemption payment date which will be no less frequent than one day each month may be more than seven days from the time that a shareholder of a series tenders interests to the series thus applicants are requesting relief from section e to permit the fund and its series to pay redemption proceeds more than seven days from the tender of such interests  applicants state that the primary purpose of section e is to address the abusive practices of early openend companies that claimed that their securities were redeemable only to then institute barriers to redemption applicants represent that the funds policies will not raise the possibility of such abuses the funds redemption policy will be a fundamental policy changeable only by a majority vote of its shareholders and the approval of the commission or its staff applicants undertake to disclose the funds redemption policy on the cover page of its offering memorandum and in any marketing materials and to refrain from holding itself out as a “mutual fund” most importantly the fund will limit its investors to qualified purchasers who are highly sophisticated investors capable of understanding the funds redemption policy and its associated risks  in  the commission proposed rule e under the act that set forth an “extended payment fund” structure similar to that proposed for the fund the commissions proposal was designed to permit a registered investment company that could both offer redeemable securities and invest in assets including less liquid foreign securities that did not meet the sevenday liquidity standard for traditional openend funds under proposed rule e an openend fund could make payment upon redemption of its securities up to  days after tender of the securities to the fund at nav determined on the next redemption pricing date following the tender provided that a the fund did so pursuant to a fundamental policy setting forth the number of days between a tender and the next redemption pricing and payment dates changeable only with approval of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities b at least  of the funds assets consisted of assets that either i may be sold in the ordinary course of business at approximately the price used to compute the funds nav within the period between the tender and the next redemption payment date or ii mature by the next redemption payment date and c the fund does not hold itself out to investors as a mutual fund applicants assert that the fund will comply with requirements that are designed to achieve the same goals but which account for the repatriation restrictions discussed above  section c of the act permits the commission to exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the act if the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies of the act applicants believe that the relief is appropriate because the fund can provide a convenient and costeffective means of obtaining tailored exposure to china a shares for investing matthews funds other funds and separate accounts applicants also believe that the requested relief is consistent with the protection of investors because shares of the fund will be available only to qualified purchasers finally applicants state that the relief is consistent with the purposes intended by the policies of the act because as discussed above it does not raise the concerns addressed by section e of the act and rule c under the act b section be of the act  section be of the act provides that every registered investment company shall file with the commission a recital of its policy in respect of concentrating investments in a particular industry or group of industries form na implements the section b requirement to disclose a funds concentration policy instruction  to item  of form na requires a fund to “disclose any policy to concentrate in securities of issuers in a particular industry or group of industries ie investing more than  of a funds net assets in a particular industry or group of industries” applicants state that the commissions staff has taken the position that statements of concentration policy pursuant to which registrants reserve the right to concentrate in particular industries without limitation if deemed advisable and in the best interests of the shareholders do not comply with section b applicants assert that the primary purposes of the industry concentration test include preventing a funds investment adviser from inappropriately concentrating a funds investments contrary to investor expectations and from reserving freedom of action to concentrate the funds investments which may not provide investors with sufficient clarity to form expectations about concentration  applicants state that the application of section be at the series level imposes a barrier to the efficient operation of the series when conducting otherwise routine portfolio changes contrary to the expectations of matthews fund or other fund shareholders for a series with a limited number of holdings routine portfolio changes could frequently result in a series “concentrating” its investments in different industries or groups of industries using the commissions  threshold for determining concentration even though such series “concentration” would have little or no meaningful impact on the industry concentration of the investing matthews funds or other fundsoverall portfolio applicants state that absent relief and assuming a policy to concentrate in the particular industry has not been disclosed in the series registration statement any routine portfolio change that results in a series “concentrating” its investments measured solely at the series level would need the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the series in accordance with section  of the act applicants submit that while a series could obtain a shareholder vote every time it crossed the  “concentration” threshold since each series will be owned by a client of the adviser this result would be unnecessary cumbersome and serve no policy objective  applicants propose that due to the structure nature and purpose of the fund each series be exempt from section be and the requirement to disclose a policy of concentrating in a particular industry or group of industries applicants have proposed conditions that would require each series to disclose that it does not have a concentration policy and that any registered investment company that invests in a series will aggregate the series holdings with its own holdings for purposes of evaluating its concentration policy applicants state that an investor in a matthews fund should have expectations regarding the industry concentration of the portfolio taken as a whole of the matthews fund in which she has invested and she is protected by the requirement that the start printed page matthews fund disclose and adhere to its own concentration policy applicants submit that imposing an additional layer of concentration requirements on a series would not serve an investor protection purpose accordingly applicants assert that granting the requested relief is warranted under the standards set forth in section c of the act c section d of the act  section da provides that no registered investment company may acquire securities of another investment company if such securities represent more than  of the acquired companys outstanding voting stock more than  of the acquiring companys total assets or if such securities together with the securities of other investment companies represent more than  of the acquiring companys total assets section db provides that no registered openend investment company its principal underwriter or any broker or dealer may sell the companys securities to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired companys voting stock or cause more than  of the acquired companys voting stock to be owned by investment companies  section dg of the act provides in relevant part that section d will not apply to the securities of a registered openend investment company purchased by another registered openend investment company if a the acquiring company and the acquired company are part of the same group of investment companies b the acquiring company holds only securities of acquired companies that are part of the same group of investment companies government securities and shortterm paper c the aggregate sales loads and distributionrelated fees of the acquiring company and the acquired company are not excessive under rules adopted pursuant to section b or section c of the act by a securities association registered under section a of the securities exchange act of  or by the commission and d the acquired company has a policy that prohibits it from acquiring securities of registered openend management investment companies or registered unit investment trusts in reliance on section df or g of the act applicants state that section dg is unavailable largely due to the other funds not being “registered” under the act its unavailability is not due to any difference that relates to the policies supporting section d applicants further state that if the other funds were registered in the united states as openend funds they like the matthews funds would be entitled to rely on section dg and the rules thereunder to invest in the series if they were part of the same “group of investment companies” as defined in section dgii  section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction from any provision of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants seek an exemption under section dj to permit the other funds to purchase interests of series which as discussed herein would result in an other fund owning  of the interests of a particular series  applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not raise the policy concerns underlying sections da and b including undue influence by a fund of funds over underlying funds excessive layering of fees and overly complex fund structures accordingly applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  applicants contend that the proposed arrangement will not result in undue influence by an other fund over the fund because as manager of the other funds the adviser will act to prevent undue influence  applicants do not believe that the proposed arrangement will involve excessive layering of fees applicants state that among other protections described above fee arrangements for the series will be subject to review and approval by the funds board including its independent members in accordance with section c of the act and their impact on overall fees for the advisers client will be fully disclosed to the client with respect to other funds that invest in the fund no sales load will be charged by the fund other sales charges and service fees as defined in nasd conduct rule  if any will only be charged at the fund level or at the other fund level not both with respect to other investments in the fund any sales charges andor service fees charged with respect to shares of the fund will not exceed the limits applicable to a fund of funds set forth in such rule   applicants contend that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure condition  provides that no series of the fund will acquire securities of any investment company or company relying on section c or c of the act in excess of the limits of section da except to the extent that such series of the fund acquires or is deemed to have acquired the securities pursuant to exemptive relief from the commission permitting such series of the fund to a acquire securities of one or more affiliated investment companies or companies relying on section c or c for shortterm cash management purposes or b engage in interfund borrowing and lending transactions d section a of the act  section a of the act generally prohibits purchases and sales of securities on a principal basis between a registered investment company and any affiliated person of the company and affiliated persons of such persons section a of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person to include among other things any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the others outstanding voting securities any person  or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with power to vote by the other person any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person and any investment adviser to an investment company applicants describe several bases of potential affiliation in the application and state that if the other funds and the fund are deemed affiliates of each other or even secondtier affiliates the sale of interests of the fund to the other funds and the redemption of such interests by the other funds could be prohibited under section a of the act  section b of the act authorizes the commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section a if it finds that a the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved and c the proposed start printed page transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  applicants seek an exemption under sections c and b to allow the proposed transactions applicants state that the transactions satisfy the standards for relief under sections c and b specifically applicants state that the terms of the transactions are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching applicants note that the consideration paid and received for the sale and redemption of interests of the fund will be based on the nav of the fund and no sales load will be charged by the fund and other sales charges and service fees if any will only be charged at the fund level or the other fund level but not both in addition applicants represent that the proposed transactions will be consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved and the general purposes of the act applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the funds outstanding securities will be owned exclusively by persons who are qualified purchasers as defined in section a of the act and the rules thereunder  the fund will adopt a fundamental policy which may be changed only by a majority vote of the outstanding voting
