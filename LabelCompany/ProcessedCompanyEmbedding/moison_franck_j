topshop  years after giannis murder versace has rediscovered its soul afp  friday july   twenty years ago stylist gianni versace was gunned down in miami plunging his fashion house into crisis two decades on it is one of the worlds top global luxury brands thanks to his little sister donatella he had gone out for the morning papers as versace returned to his miami beach mansion on july   he was shot dead by andrew cunanan a homosexual prostitute known for his obsession with all things luxury the fashion world mourned deeply the stylist to celebrities from madonna to elton john had been just  years old he was a degrees creator a real artist he had a pure creative vision on colours and materials stefania saviolo director of the luxury and fashion centre at bocconi university told afp in milan the group he had created with his brother santo in  had been one of the hottest fashion brands in the world it fell to versaces platinum blonde sister donatella  to whom gianni had entrusted the casual line versus  to take over as artistic director but the brand struggled to recover from versaces murder donatella who had worked for  years alongside gianni was severely affected by the loss of her brother and confessed to feeling vulnerable depression and cocaine you cant invent yourself as an artistic director overnight says saviolo particularly as donatella took over at a time when fashion was changing a lot with many collections and great pressure on artistic directors donatella instantly recognisable for her famous locks and perpetual tan sank into a period of depression and cocaine use before detoxifying in  the year before the brand had acquired a new ceo in giancarlo di risio the former fendi boss refocused the medusa on the luxury market streamlining licensing and franchising deals and developing the accessories range amid rumours in the press of a fallout between the family and di risio over planned cuts he was replaced in  by gian giacomo ferraris who moved over from the jil sander fashion house ferraris wasted no time in launching an extensive reorganisation plan to return versace to profitability cutting  percent of its workforce and closing some boutiques before opening new ones as the books improved his intervention doubled the turnover which rose from  million euros in  to  million in  according to david pambianco who heads up a consultancy company in his name by  the historic brand had returned to profit after a gruelling three years of losses so much potential the right balance was struck between ferraris and donatella the dialogue between them was good and there was great respect for donatellas creativity and vision saviolo said the family which had always refused to relinquish control to a luxury conglomerate like so many of its fellow italian fashion houses finally yielded a  percent stake in  to the us private equity firm blackstone the move which donatella said would allow versace to achieve its potential resulted in a cash injection into the luxury designer and boosted its presence in emerging markets the bet paid off despite a difficult global context sales increased by some  percent in  and in  the house said it was time to move onto the next phase and ferraris was replaced in may  by jonathan akeroyd former ceo of alexander mcqueen results last year were mixed with sales up  percent to  million euros but the company admitting a loss of  million euros due in particular to funds sunk into its network of boutiques these results have caused some uncertainty but the company is healthy certainly more than  years ago said pambianco versace remains one of the most beautiful brands in the world in the luxury sector and has still so much potential to express he said pointing out that luxury house gucci for example has a turnover that is seven times higher saviolo agrees versace has recovered its lost red carpet dna and its style is currently very daring very strong afp photo versace aw catwalkpictures

was among the top menswear designers working for brands like louis vuitton and martin margiela last year he took a step back and launched his own menswear line ‘helbers’ his first two collections have been wellreceived by major fashion retailers in france the united kingdom and the united states ”it isn’t possible to entirely impose your own taste on large department stores” helbers told fashionweeknl in an interview earlier this year “my approach now is smaller and more personal and i can pay more attention to a product than i could at a large brand furthermore the word ‘luxury’ is no longer part of my vocabulary in that sense our clients are very different compared to louis vuitton” collarless flight jacket in cotton satin – spring summer  photo christopheberlet helbers quilting seb a post shared by helbers helbersparis on jun   at am pdt blockquote paul helbers’ eponymous brand is well received helbers made his debut in paris last year with his collection of formal and casual menswear which includes chunky knits trousers jackets and shoes in the mid to high segment prices range from  euros for a shirt to  euros for a coat his second collection built on this style but included lighter materials and looser details the products were already available at barneys in new york mr porter and matches fashion pin an interview with fashionista he described his target group as ‘people who care about clothes and want a certain effortlessness’ “i don’t really have an age in mind when i design it’s more about personality than fashion a collection in which you find selfexpression without losing your own identity without becoming a fashion victim” paul helbers from consultant to designer for major fashion houses helbers worked as a designer for maison martin margiela for five years before joining louis vuitton where he worked under marc jacobs in the menswear division before kicking off his career working for major fashion houses helbers graduated from the royal college of art in london and went to work for the now discontinued fashion chain mac  maggie in amsterdam “it was what hm is today” helbers said of the brand following his time there he joined forces with several mac  maggie colleagues to launch the tailored sportswear collection called inch “it was very dutch i come from the netherlands and when you fly over the country you see that it too is very much designed every square inch is cultivated and that was also the idea behind the collection” helbers told fashionista eventually he quit the label and started to work as a menswear designer in the netherlands not long after he received a call from margiela asking him to join the brand as a designer his time at margiela was a major learning process for helbers because – as he tells it – he was confronted with a designer who ‘ultimately makes both clothing and fashion’ “i also learned to think before drawing instead of simply producing and reworking you follow the entire process of conceptualization” helbers revealed paul helbers takes step back with launch of eponymous fashion label when helbers joined louis vuitton in  menswear collections were still rather inconsequential in the time he worked for the fashion house he was able to double menswear’s revenues after leaving louis vuitton in  helbers became a consultant for a range of fashion brands including chinese cashmere manufacturer erdos in the meantime he also laid down the groundwork for his own brand not only did he look for partners he also explored the way in which his collections would be manufactured “where and how my clothing is made is very important to me” helbers said helbers chose to launch his own brand because he has a very specific methodology “my inspiration often arises from a historic perspective the workshops i worked with are all as old as my inspirational images” he told fashionweeknl “i often enter into a very close working relationship with workshops which ensures that traditional craftsmanship is given new life and becomes connected with the present this methodology is hard to find among existing brands because there the focus is usually on the research of the product” he explained in the interview helbers’ use of athleisure features in his collections is not arbitrary most recently he worked in a consultancy capacity for milanbased womenswear athleisure brand callens  co where he found inspiration for his own brand “in the end people can only ever do one thing i’m a onetrick pony in the nineties i had already based my own label on materials for sportswear but i didn’t yet have the experience i garnered working for louis vuitton and margiela since then i have learned how to use materials without losing their elegance” he revealed to fashionista according to the designer the latter has proved to be an advantage “i think that nowadays there is more room to explore this side of fashion than in the past people travel more their lives are more dynamic and so the functionality of the collection emphasizes the way of life” helbers told fashionweeknl that we can expect an expansion of this current collection with accessories “the goal is to someday open our own stores” these would also offer items like glassware porcelain and books “i want to expand and delve deeper” read also menswear designer to watch out
