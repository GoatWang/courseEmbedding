for repeal of new north carolina law  pm pdt  by gregg kilday facebook twitter email me print comments mark von holdengetty images bob weinstein harvey weinstein signatories to the letter which accuses the state of sanctioning discrimination against lgbt people include facebooks mark zuckerberg and apples tim cook bob and harvey weinstein and producerdirector adam shankman have joined more than  ceos and business leaders calling for the repeal of a north carolina law signed last week by gov pat mccrory that they contend eliminates existing municipal nondiscrimination protections for lgbt people in the state the signatories to the letter released tuesday by the human rights campaign and the state organization equality nc also include such prominent leaders in the tech industry as facebook chairman and ceo mark zuckerberg apple ceo tim cook google ceo sundar pichai and yahoo president and ceo marissa mayer north carolina’s house bill  which was passed by the north carolina general assembly and signed into law last week puts into place a statewide policy banning individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex it also preempts local nondiscrimination ordinances reserving the right to pass nondiscrimination laws to the state government lambda legal the american civil liberties union aclu of north carolina and equality have already filed a lawsuit in federal court calling the law unconstitutional hrc president chad griffin and equality nc executive director chris sgro are scheduled to deliver the letter to the governor’s office on thursday and have requested a meeting with the governor the letter and its signatories follow dear governor mccrory we write with concerns about legislation you signed into law last week hb  which has overturned protections for lgbt people and sanctioned discrimination across north carolina put simply hb  is not a bill that reflects the values of our companies of our country or even the overwhelming majority of north carolinians we are disappointed in your decision to sign this discriminatory legislation into law the business community by and large has consistently communicated to lawmakers at every level that such laws are bad for our employees and bad for business this is not a direction in which states move when they are seeking to provide successful thriving hubs for business and economic development we believe that hb  will make it far more challenging for businesses across the state to recruit and retain the nation’s best and brightest workers and attract the most talented students from across the nation it will also diminish the state’s draw as a destination for tourism new businesses and economic activity discrimination is wrong and we believe it has no place in north carolina or anywhere in our country as companies that pride ourselves on being inclusive and welcoming to all we strongly urge you and the leadership of north carolina’s legislature to repeal this law in the upcoming legislative session sincerely karen appleton senior vice president box brandee barker cofounder the pramana collective marc benioff ceo salesforce chip bergh president

individualized with premature ovarian failure all the statistics said that i had literally zero chance of conceiving a child with my own eggs even with the best fertility treatments most clinics said they could only help me if i were willing to use donor eggs but dr turkaspa was willing to try with my own eggs after i failed to respond to even the most aggressive standard protocol he devised an experimental treatment for me based on some recent studies the result were currently pregnant with fraternal twins with a third perfect embryo frozen for future use even he seemed a little amazed at the results advocate health care ilan tur kaspa mdmaureen rateddr turkaspa is the best in hdr turkaspa is the best in his field i went to him after  failed ivfs from a previous doctor he took the time with me to answer all my questions and concerns his staff is also courteous and kind and was always there to answer any questions or concerns at my second appointment he found polyps in my uterine lining that were missed by the previous doctor we then did ivf with icsi and assisted hatching and i am now in my th week of pregnancy im over the moon and so grateful to dr turkaspa and his staff for helping me make my dreams come true pregnant at  i couldnt ask for anything more im so thankful to them and would reccomend him to anyone struggling with infertilityadvocate health care ilan tur kaspa mdannask ratedi went through  failed ivf cycles and also we had very few embryos  ready for transfer i was recommended to meet dr turkaspahe went through all the medical documentation that i brought with me and suggested a different protocol i went through  cycles but the first was without a transfer intentionally we had   embryos and bottom line  i am  months pregnant i am aware of that sometimes dr turkaspa has a cynical and non graceful attitude but all in all i feel that hes super professional and the best doctor that ever treated me hes a good listener and also he has an outstanding out of the box way of thinkingdr anil r shah mdaleksandra k ratedstarting off i want to say that the staff here is beyond welcoming and helpful dr anil shah himself has a warm yet confident and at the same time caring personality which made me trust him from the beginning over other doctors i have seen after my surgery it was extremely easy for me to transition into my new nose because the change was so subtle and non invasive recovery for me was a walk in a park as well and that was my biggest fear going into this overall from beginning till now i feel great about my decision and i feel deep in my heart it is thanks to dr shah and his caring staffharmony medical  wellness centerpatientmary rateddr james mo excellent family ddr james mo excellent family doctori would highly recommend dr mo to everyone dr mo is a caring and very knowledgeable family physician he and his office staff are very friendly my entire family has been seeing dr mo for many years and very satisfied with him he listens to what you have to say and cares deeply about your condition he spends a lot of time with us and you dont find a lot of doctors that are willing to do that nowadays his diagnosis is always very accurate we have high level of trust in him dr mo also does immigration exams and physical therapy which are awesomedr anil r shah mdk f ratedsaw dr shah for a rhinoplasty best decision i ever made i am now  months post op and could not be happier with the results dr shah is an excellent skilled surgeonreally an artist he also has a very friendly and approachable bedside manner his staff is always super helpful appointments are always on time which is so rare with doctors these days if you are considering rhinoplasty dr shah is the best i already referred a friend for a rhinoplasty with dr shah his surgery was last week and also had nothing but the best things to say about dr shahdr anil r shah mdk r rateddrshah turned my vision for my rhinoplasty into a reality i am so happy with the results i do however wish that he had been able to articulate to me a little more how the procedure went what was done and that i had stitches still in my nose after the one week follow up where the black stitches were removed i did not know the blue stitches were in there and pulled them out on accident thinking it was a hair or something because the swelling had covered them overall though very happy i did the procedure and think that drshah did a beautiful jobdr anil r shah mdwaylon f ratedi had a great experience with dr shah i was a bit nervous at first because i have never had surgery and did not know what to expect his staff was very comforting throughout the entire process and answered all of my questions what i found amazing was that after the removal of a lipoma from my forehead i did not feel any pain only pressure throughout the healing process best of all i do not have a visible scar since he went through my hair line i also did not have to shave any portion of my head i could not be any happier waylon fdid you knowphysicians and surgeons help to keep people  from infants to the elderly  as healthy as possible these individuals

your carriers network rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network out of network is typically more expensive doctors often

with your surgeon its important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have they must take the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan yearif you plan to go to the doctor need medication or have been recommended for surgery call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your
