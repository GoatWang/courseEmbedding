ended march   results of operations overview of current operations powermedchairs was incorporated in the state of nevada on february   under the name powermedchairs we consider ourselves to be an emerging growth company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements from our inception to date we have generated no revenues and our operations have been limited to organizational startup and capital formation activities our plan of operation is to rebuild wheelchairs in disrepair market our services and sell wheelchairs on march   the company formed a subsidiary named powermedchairs shareholder acquisition corporation this subsidiary acquired the control block of  shares of tropical pc inc a dormant nevada corporation for  cash this control block represent  of the issued and outstanding shares of tropical pc after the  shares were acquired by powermedchairs by a board resolution they were cancelled the remaining shareholders of tropical pc representing  shares exchanged their shares on a oneforone basis for shares in the subsidiary when the subsidiary collapsed into powermedchairs each of the subsidiarys shareholders received a oneforone share exchange of powermedchairs shares these newly issued shares were issued in the reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by section  of the act on the basis that the transaction does not involve a public offering our business powermedchairs plans to rebuild primarily electricpower wheelchairs in disrepair electric wheelchairs are for people who need support for their upper body and who are unable to move a manual chair with their arms and hands a power chair has a more supportive seat and often a headrest for people who are not able to hold themselves upright the electric wheelchair consists of a number of mechanical and electric components that need to be replaced every few year in most cases it is much more cost effective to repair a broken electric wheelchair than replace the entire unit products and services a wheelchair is a chair with wheels designed to be a replacement for walking the device comes in variations where it is propelled by motors or by the seated occupant turning the rear wheels by hand often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness physiological or physical injury or disability everyday manual wheelchairs come in two major designsfolding or rigid the rigid chairs which are increasingly preferred by active users have permanently welded joints and many fewer moving parts this reduces the energy required to push the chair by eliminating many points where the chair would flex as it moves welding the joints also reduces the overall weight of the chair rigid chairs typically feature instantrelease rear wheels and backrests that fold down flat allowing the user to dismantle the chair quickly for storage in a car the primary design of a rigid wheelchair is to fit the body of the user the primary design of a folding wheelchair is to fold folding wheelchairs are generally boxy while rigid wheelchairs conform to the shape of the body for example with a rigid chair one can taper the design to conform to the body shape large at the hips narrow at the knees which can hold the users body in place also the aluminum between the knees and footrest can be tapered wider at the knees narrow at the feet holding the feet in place with a folding chair you cannot taper it or it would not close completely rigid wheelchairs generally have more configurations and adjustments then folding chairs most folding wheelchairs have limits in their configurations and adjustments for example many folding wheelchairs do not allow for adjusting the angle between the backrest and the seat many rigid models are now made with ultralight materials such as aircraft aluminum and titanium another innovation in rigid chair design is the installation of polymer shock absorbers which cushion the bumps over which the chair rolls these shock absorbers may be added to the front wheels or to the rear wheels or both rigid chairs also have the option for their rear wheels to have a camber wheels can have a camber or tilt which angles the tops of the wheels in toward the chair this allows for better propulsion by the user which is desired by longterm users sport wheelchairs have large camber angles to improve stability an electricpowered wheelchair is a wheelchair that is moved via the means of an electric motor and navigational controls usually a small joystick mounted on the armrest rather than manual power for users who cannot manage a manual joystick head switches chinoperated joysticks sipandpuff or other specialist controls may allow independent operation of the wheelchair a powerassisted wheelchair is a recent development that uses the frame  seating of a typical manual chair while replacing the standard rear wheels with wheels that have small batterypowered motors in the hubs a floating rim design senses the pressure applied by the users push  activates the motors proportionately this results in the convenience small size  lightweight of a manual chair while providing motorized assistance for roughuneven terrain  steep slopes that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to navigate especially by those with limited upperbody function we plan to rebuild wheelchairs in disrepair these wheelchairs can be highly customized for the users needs such customizations may encompass the seat dimensions height seat angle also called seat dump or squeeze footrests leg rests front caster outriggers adjustable backrests and controls additional customizations can include various optional accessories such as antitip bars or wheels safety belts adjustable backrests tilt andor recline features extra support for limbs or neck mounts or carrying devices for crutches walkers or oxygen tanks drink holders and clothing protectors based on managements past experience with aa medical supply in repairing wheelchairs the time needed to rebuild a wheelchair will take us  weeks which includes the time needed to obtain prior approval from the patients insurance company the basic cost to rebuild a wheel chair can be  if we were to add special features tilt or recline chair to the wheelchair the price could increase by an additional  recent technological advances are improving wheelchairs and its technology some wheelchairs incorporate gyroscopic technology and other advances enabling the chair to balance and run on only two of its four wheels on some surfaces thus raising the user to a height comparable to a standing person they can also incorporate stairclimbing and fourwheeldrive feature motorized assists for handpowered chairs are becoming more available and advanced wheelchair reimbursement the company is directly affected by government regulation and reimbursement policies in virtually every state in which the company operates in the united states the growth of health care costs has increased at rates in excess of the rate of inflation and as a percentage of gdp for several decades a number of efforts to control the federal deficit have impacted reimbursement levels for government sponsored health care programs and private insurance companies and state medicaid programs peg their reimbursement levels to medicare reimbursement guidelines in the home health care industry have a substantial impact on the nature and type of equipment an enduser can obtain and thus affect the product mix pricing and payment patterns of the companys customers who are medical equipment users management believes its technical expertise will allow it to respond to ongoing regulatory reimbursement changes however the issues described above will likely continue to have significant impacts on the pricing of the companys products medicare wheelchair reimbursement manual wheelchairs are considered durable medical equipment under medicare guidelines most of the cost of a wheelchair will be covered under your original medicare part b plan a wheelchair user will have to pay  percent and meet your yearly part b deductible in order for a wheelchair to be covered under medicare the requirements are � it must be medically necessary as determined by a doctor � a physician has documented this information for medicare � the patient has a certificate of necessity like a prescription � the patient must purchase your wheelchair from a medicareapproved supplier prior approval before the company can begin work on rebuilding a wheelchair it must contact the patients insurance provider the insurance provider based on the age condition and cost to repair the wheelchair will make a decision to approve the repairs in many cases where the power wheelchair is more than five  years old the insurance carrier will not approve the repairs and recommend the patient purchases a new wheelchair marketing strategy our sole officerdirector is also ceo of aa medical supply llc based at the same address as our company in ohio aa medical supply llc is a growing medical supply company that services in the medical supply needs to patients in the cleveland oh area powermedchairs entered into a separate service agreement with aa medical supply to rebuild the wheelchairs brought into its shop for repairs currently aa medical supply receives approximately thirty  broken wheelchairs per month there are no assurances this number of repairs will remain at this level additionally the company plans to market its services to doctors therapists home health care agencies in the ohio eastern indiana and northern kentucky areas it is these health care provides that are the first to recognize a wheelchair in disrepair the marketing to these individuals will take place by sending them sales brochure on what the company can do and speaking directly with these providers if the companys can move its business forward management would consider building and marketing its own branded wheelchair competition we may not have the resources to compete with our existing competitors or with any new competitors we intend to compete with many other competitors who perform wheelchair repairs all of which have significantly greater personnel financial and managerial resources than we do this competition from other companies with greater resources and reputations may result in our failure to maintain or expand our business moreover as the demand for wheelchairs increases new companies may enter the market and the influx of added competition will pose an increased risk to our company increased competition may lead to price wars which would harm us since we would be unable to compete with companies with greater resources in addition increased competition and increased demand may create a stress on the wheelchair manufacturers output capabilities which may lead to increased prices which would also harm our ability to compete in the wheelchair market intellectual property we rely or plan to rely on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the united states as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our wheelchair proprietary repair methodologies and any new wheelchair brand we might develop in the future we currently have no pending patents nor trademarks from time to time we expect that we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property also the efforts management has taken to protect its proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective any significant impairment of its intellectual property rights could harm the existing business the brand and reputation and the ability of the business to compete on a going forward basis also protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming employees we currently has no employees our ceo performs all duties related to the operations of this business we also plan to utilize additional independent contractors on a parttimeas needed basis property our corporate headquarters are located at  e washington street chagrin falls oh  we do not own any real property management believes that its current facilities are adequate for its needs through the next twelve months and that should it be needed suitable additional space will be available to accommodate expansion of the companys operations on commercially reasonable terms although there can be no assurance in this regard results of operations for the three and six months ended september   and  during the three and six month period ended september   the company did not generate any revenues in addition the company does not expect to generate any profit for the next twelve months for the three months ending september   we experienced a net loss of  as compared to a net loss of  for the same period last year the net loss for the three months ending september   was attributed to  in general  administrative expenses as compared to  in general  administrative expenses for the same period last year for the six months ending september   we experienced a net loss of  as compared to a net loss of  for the same period last year the net loss for the six months ending september   was attributed to  in general  administrative expenses as compared to  in general  administrative expenses for the same period last year the company used net cash in operations of  during the six month period ended september   as compared to using net cash of  for the same period last year the company was provided with  of net cash from financing activities during the six month ended september   as compared to no cash from financing activities for the same period last year revenues the company has generated no revenues since its inception as of september   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurances that the company can achieve or sustain profitability or that the companys operating losses will not increase in the future plan of operation the companys plan of operation is to rebuild wheelchairs in disrepair market its services and sell wheelchairs as of september   we had  cash on hand and prepaid expenses of  management believes without any additional funding or revenues the company has sufficient cash to finance its operations to repair and market wheelchairs for a period of twelve months which estimate includes the additional expenses the company will incur as a reporting company we will apply any proceeds from future revenues to help cover our expenditures at this time management does not anticipate it will be required to seek outside funding to keep its business operational for the next twelve months however does not preclude management from seeking funding in the future if we experience losses in our first year of business operations we do not believe such losses would prevent us from continuing our operations for our first year based on our current cash reserves if and when the time comes that we seek funding we plan to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations and we would have to issue equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders there is no assurance that we will achieve any of additional sales of our equity securities or other financing to fund our business operations we currently have no agreements arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans lines of credit or any other sources future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations and financial condition any future acquisitions of other businesses technologies services or products might require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing which might not be available on terms favorable to the company or at all and such financing if available might be dilutive going concern our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the march   audited financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations therefore management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the company while the company is devoting its best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern summary of any product research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation we do not anticipate performing any product research and development under our current plan of operation expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment we do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment as such items are not required by us at this time significant changes in the number of employees as of september   we did not have any employees we are dependent upon our two officers for our future business development as our operations expand we anticipate the need to hire additional employees consultants and professionals however the exact number is not quantifiable at this time liquidity and capital resources the company is authorized to issue  shares of its  par value common stock as of september   the company has  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of september   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  the company has limited financial resources available which has had an adverse impact on the companys liquidity activities and operations in order for the company to remain a going concern it will need to find additional capital or generate revenues additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements additional notes payable to banks or related parties officers directors or stockholdersor from other available funding sources at market rates of interest or a combination of these the ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought no assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained on terms favorable to the company or at all management believes the company has sufficient cash assets to fund its operations and keep the company fully reporting for the next twelve  months without seeking additional outside funding offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results or operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales once all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met pervasive evidence that an agreement exists

secure in era of political and economic uncertainties  important and helpful to know  the internet and globalization have created mass access to products that were designed to be exclusively sold at

and foreign popular brandname skin care products up to recent past these brands were truly exclusive only professionals were able to purchase these products wholesale and only through distribution channels designated by manufacturers this process of distribution granted you a professional advantage and exclusiveness over products available in department and beautysupply stores current global marketing developments such as the implementation of sales through the internet have virtually eliminated this exclusivity inevitably the internet has made it possible for your loyal customers to access the brandname product that you sell in your salon in a much faster more convenient and more affordable way the distributors that you rely on for your exclusivity are no longer able to control the spread of countless websites that offer consumers the identical brandname products found previously only at professional salons and spas like yours now literally anyone can purchase retail in a
