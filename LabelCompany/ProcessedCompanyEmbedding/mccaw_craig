att wireless services founded in  as mccaw cellular communications and now legally known as new cingular wireless services formerly part of att corp is a wireless telephone carrier in the united states based in redmond washington and later traded on the new york stock exchange under the stock symbol awe as a separate entity from its former parent on october   att wireless was acquired by cingular wireless a joint venture of sbc communications and bellsouth to form the largest wireless carrier in the united states at the time on november   att wireless stores were rechristened under the cingular banner the legal entity att wireless services inc was renamed new cingular wireless services inc in late  sbc the majority partner in cingular acquired the original att and rebranded as the new att cingular became wholly owned by the new att in december  as a result of the new atts acquisition of bellsouth after the merger cingular was renamed att mobility in early  and remained the

att wireless began in  as mccaw cellular communications a cellular telephone pioneer in the united states savvy licensing of cellular spectrum in the early s put mccaw cellular in an extremely strong position quickly outpacing the growth of the baby bells in the emerging market the company purchased mci communicationss mobile businesses in  followed by lin broadcasting in  giving them widespread access in all of the major us markets partnering with att as a technology provider mccaw introduced their cellular one service in  the first truly national cellular system att purchased  of the company in  and arranged a merger in  that made craig mccaw one of atts largest shareholders in  the company was spun off from att to become att wireless services in  j elroy mccaw sold one of his cable television holdings in centralia washington to his three sons including craig who was  years old at the time craig took an increasingly central role in the development of mccaw communications and by the early s had grown the company from  subscribers to about  million in annual revenue in  mccaw came across an att document about the future of cellular telephony which predicted that by the start of the st century there would be  cellular subscribers in the united states intrigued mccaw found that the licenses for cellular spectrum were being sold at  per pop meaning he could build a base for future subscribers for very low cost by  mccaw communications had purchased licenses in six of the  largest us markets mccaw then succeeded in using the licenses and collateral based on the att projections using that collateral to take out loans and buy more licenses and eventually buying billions of dollars of spectrum in  he sold the cable business for  million and used this new capital to buy even more cellular licenses it was around this time that the first wave of analog cellular telephones were starting to enter the consumer conscience the baby bells started the process of buying their own licenses only to find that mccaw owned enough of most of the major markets to lock them out unless they purchased spare licenses from him at a huge profit his network of licenses in the major markets was used as a lever to buy sell or trade licenses in other markets that were not considered profitable at a considerable discount in  the company purchased mcis wireless operations cellular and paging for  million and changed their name to mccaw cellular communications in  the company outbid bellsouth for control of lin broadcasting which owned licenses in houston dallas los angeles and new york paying  billion a price that represented  per license cellular oneedit at this point mccaws focus turned from dealing licenses to servicing the network signing up customers in what was now a maturing technology on the cusp of explosive growth in order to handle the customer side of the business mccaw turned to att for technology in  mccaw cellular introduced ss signaling across their network prior to this each cell tower in the network connected to local signaling billing and sets of landlines since only the towers in the area local to the customers home had access to dialing and routing information when they traveled to another area calls could not reach them with the introduction of ss signaling the dialing and routing information could now be switched across the entire network known technically as nonfacility associated signalling tying it together into a single national network they called the new system cellular one and introduced the concept of roaming charges that year mccaw earned  million making him americas highestpaid chief executive the partnership grew in november  when att purchased  of the company for  billion at the time the company was generating  billion in annual revenue and had two million cellular one subscribers  far more customers than atts earlier projections for all cellular use in the us at a point almost ten years earlier purchase by att corpedit in  the merger of the two companies was completed when att purchased the rest of mccaw cellular for  billion at that time the second largest merger in us history second only to the rjr nabisco takeover documented in barbarians at the gate the merger was completed in late  creating att wireless group which was at that time the largest cellular carrier in the us att kickstarted their cellular division with  million subscribers as a result of the merger craig mccaw became one of atts largest shareholders but he refused to sit on the board of directors because he couldnt stand long meetings mccaw left daily operations to focus on teledesic passing control of att wireless to james barksdale and then steve hooper when barksdale left for netscape hooper a long time mccaw cellular executive was tapped by att to be the ceo of the newly acquired division under his direction att wireless grew to be the nations largest cellular provider by the end of  at which point hooper and many of the remaining mccaw era executives departed by  and  the cellular industry began to consolidate and verizon wireless and cingular wireless became the first and second largest national carriers the year  also brought john d zeglis as chief executive in october followed a few months later by dan hesses departure who had been head of the division since  over the next year and a half all six mccaw regional presidents left the declining company spinoffedit att wireless services logo in april  att wireless became a separately traded entity with the worlds largest initial public offering at that time just over a year later in july  att wireless became a separate company rather than a division of att corp in  att wireless was granted several mobile licenses for caribbean countries including barbados grenada saint lucia and saint vincent and the grenadines att wireless decline climaxed in  with the fcc mandating the allowance of porting numbers to other carriers att wireless experienced a mass exodus of many customers who were fed up with years of degrading service and poor coverage by the end of  att wireless faced a public relations nightmare when a new system for adding subscribers and porting numbers inout was implemented and botched realizing that it faced an impossible situation att wireless services inc began accepting bids in early  to be acquired as of january   the largest single shareholder of att wireless was japans ntt docomo which was one of the first to place a bid to buy the company in the middle of  much of the caribbean operations and bermuda were agreed to be sold to digicel group acquisition by cingularedit on february   att wireless accepted bids for acquisition of the wireless company the two top bidders were british carrier vodafone and american competitor cingular cingular was owned by two baby bells  by bellsouth and  by sbc communications vodafone owned  of verizon wireless and had it succeeded in the bid their share of verizon wireless would then have been sold to parent company verizon communications cingular emerged victorious february  by agreeing to pay more than  billion more than twice the companys recent trading value to acquire att wireless some analysts have said that although vodafone the worlds largest mobile operator was unsuccessful in acquiring the company it was nonetheless successful in forcing a competitor to overpay for the acquisition of att wireless the sale received us government approval and closed on october  companies that originally comprised cingular from its inception such as bellsouth mobility were absorbed into the att wireless services corporate structure the att wireless brand was retired by cingular on april   six months after the close of the merger
