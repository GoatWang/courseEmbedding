information regarding loan fees terms repayment and renewal policies what is the apr for the loan that i may get if i find a lender first off it’s important to understand what an apr is apr or annual percentage rate is meant to represent the interest rate and fees of a loan for an entire year that said the loan that you are likely to be offered by a lender is intended to be a shortterm loan that is repaid in a matter of weeks so using an apr to represent the fees can be misleading however since apr is a commonly used way of expressing the fees of other types of loans such as mortgage loans auto loans and types of personal loans we feel it’s somewhat useful for you to know what the representative apr ranges could be for a shortterm loan since moneymutual is not a lender we aren’t able to accurately represent the exact apr that your lender may offer however the typical representative apr range is somewhere between  and  for a  day loan remember you should pay your loan back on time to avoid fees and penalties make sure that you review the terms and conditions of the loan that is offered to you so that you don’t end up with an “annual” loan what happens if i’m late paying back the loan if you connect with a lender and accept the terms and conditions of their loan offer you are agreeing to pay that loan back in the amount of time expressed in the loan documents partial payment nonpayment or late payment is likely to result in additional fees if you refuse to repay the loan all together it is likely that the lender will engage a collection company to try and recoup what you owe them just like any lender would please don’t agree to a loan that you cannot repay renewal policies are different for every lender as a convenience to you some lenders may agree to alternative payment options some of these options may result in a renewed or “rollover” loan that may have additional fees and may renew automatically unless you request otherwise please make sure to review your lender’s renewal policies and make sure that your payment preferences are known to your lender if you have questions or need more information on renewal policies please contact your lender directly while most short term lenders will not run a traditional credit check it is important to know that in some cases credit checks consumer credit reports and other personal data may be obtained by some lenders from experian equifax trans union or through alternative providers in order to make a decision on whether or not to offer you a loan it is also important for you to remember that if you do not repay your loan on time your delinquency may be reported to a credit bureau which could negatively impact your credit score as with any loan it’s important to repay the loan on time or contact the lender to work out a payment plan please borrow responsibly remember – moneymutualcom is a great resource to find a lender when you need emergency cash quickly privately and securely please use short

is a personal loan what is a personal loan a personal loan is an amount of money that an individual borrows to fund expenses many people use them to improve their homes finance cars or just pay bills this guide will help you to understand and find the best option for your borrowing needs important terms you need to know important terms you need to know fixed payments fixed interest rates are the typical way these are structured that means youll make the same monthly payment until the balance is paid off—no ballooning payments or sliding interest rates length of term the term can be as short as a couple of months and range as long as five years  months banks frequently charge lower interest rates for longer terms amount many banks will lend up to  without requiring any collateral at banks like capital one amounts can go as high as  one lender wells fargo offers amounts as high as  for people who qualify average interest rates interest rates depend on how good your credit is thats how banks determine how likely you are to repay them if you pledge assets like your home or car banks are typically more willing to lend and lend to you at better rates because these are unsecured you dont use any of your belongings to back the amount interest rates are typically higher than what you would pay for a mortgage or car thats because a lender is taking on more risk a borrower with good credit can expect to pay from  to  for a fiveyear term the average borrower pays  on a month term given by a commercial bank reasons to use them reasons to use them there are many reasons to use a personal loan—whether your credit is excellent or even if you have bad credit here are just a few of them pay off a onetime emergency expense emergency expenses such as major car repairs or home improvements are good examples you can often get a lower interest rate by taking out a personal loan for a specific amount of money rather than borrowing more money on your credit card you have bad credit its not always possible to qualify for other types of financing you can borrow with a poor credit rating plus there is no need to put up collateral unsecured loans dont require collateral so you dont need to pledge your car or house to borrow money consolidate credit card debt personal loans for debt consolidation can be a good deal if they help you get a lower interest rate than you were paying before andor if they lower your monthly payment taking out a personal loan can be a better financial move than adding more credit card debt however—if you choose to consolidate your credit card debt with a personal loan keep in mind that this does not make the credit card debt go away it just moves the credit card debt into a new form—and you will still need to keep making your monthly payments other reasons these might be right for you include paying tuition many people use these to fund part of their education starting a small business borrowing can be a useful source of capital for small businesses help fund a wedding unexpected wedding expenses come up all the time—sometimes a personal loan is the quickest way to meet these without using a credit card relocating these loans can help you keep your stress down when moving advantages advantages personal loans have many uses as well as several advantages over other types of credit these are a few of them quick decisions normally a bank or credit union will let you know immediately if you can qualify if you do qualify you can often have the funds deposited in your account within  hours or a check delivered within a few days low documentation unlike other loan applications you typically need to provide only basic information for a personal loan such as your employment and income no collateral required you dont need to risk your home or a car or any other assets when applying interest rates lower than credit cards while interest rates on a personal loan are nowhere near as low as mortgage rates they are typically lower than your credit card interest rate make sure you compare these interest rates to be certain a personal loan will reduce the amount of interest you pay should you really use your credit card for that big purchase read this first confirmed payoff date repayment must be made within a fixed period so youll be forced to make the payments to eliminate your debt terms vary from one year to as long as  months credit improvement switching from multiple credit cards near their credit limits to a single installment loan can quickly improve your score plus since there is an end date and you cant increase your balance they are considered a less risky form of credit one disadvantage is that depending on the lenders terms there might be a prepayment penalty a prepayment penalty is an extra fee that the lender charges you if you pay your loan off sooner than planned not all have prepayment penalties but be sure to ask and read the fine print before you sign read this to compare the pros and cons for yourself common uses common uses consolidate debt  business usage  home improvement  education  car repair  other reasons  source lendingclubcom how you can qualify how you can qualify while the application process is simple there are a few things that determine if youll be approved and what the interest rate will be credit score do you know if you have good credit proof of income to get comfortable lending you money a lender may request to see how much money you make with this information the bank can determine how likely you are to make your monthly payments a lender may ask for a few payment stubs or a recent tax filing cosigners optional lenders sometimes require a person to find a cosigner cosigners commit to paying back another persons debt if he fails to do so its just a way for a lender to help ensure a debt gets paid back getting approved with bad credit getting approved with bad credit you can still qualify when you have bad credit with poor credit fewer banks may be willing to lend to you and youll probably have to pay a higher interest rate you may want to look beyond unsecured loans and pledge some assets to secure a new one you can use your car as collateral but you risk losing it if you dont pay the amount back or maybe you have a family member or friend who can cosign if your cosigner is betteroff financially and has better credit this could help you get approved the cosigner assumes responsibility if you dont make your payments and may be on the line to paying off your debt if you dont you dont always get to have your choice when you have bad credit its important to cure poor financial habits and replace them with better more healthy ones sometimes though you just have to make due repayment repayment for most people repayment is simple thanks to the easytomanage payments described in your lending agreement but what happens if you stop making the payments sometimes life happens and can make paying it back really hard when you dont pay back the amount youre said to have defaulted heres what you can expect if this happens to you your credit rating goes down your score measures how likely you are to pay debts back when you stop paying back a debt it goes down this will make it harder to borrow more money in the future youll pay penalties some lenders charge you money when you miss a payment in the worse cases this increases your debt and makes it even harder to pay back aggressive collection agents call banks end up selling off defaulted loans to other businesses they hire collection agencies to call and write you until you pay it back or a portion of it liens on your property depending on the type you default on lenders may be able to put a lien on your property and in some locations your income that means the lender can make it hard for you to sell your property or access your money top three application tips top three application tips here are three ways to increase your chances of being approved first if youre young and dont have much of a credit history dont tell the lenders that your parents wont cosign this might cause lenders to doubt your trustworthiness after all if your parents dont trust you enough to cosign why should the lender second if youre seeking to use one to make a down payment on a bigticket item explain how you are going to pay for the rest of the money to purchase the item this might cause lenders to wonder how youll ever pay them back third financial experts recommend that you never beg for approval this makes you look desperate and gives the impression that
