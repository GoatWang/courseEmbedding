driver license is in your wallet in your back pocket you are sitting on your wallet the cop does not want you to get out of the car so you stay inside the cop asks for your driver license and you have to roll a bit and reach around to pull your wallet out the cop at that point is not pointing a gun at you so if someone wanted to pull a weapon out from behind themself while appearing to pull out their wallet they could get the drop on the cop so the cop can shoot first and always say they thought you were reaching for a weapon bottom line is the cop who claims i felt threatened always gets off and the citizen winds up dead soljoin the conversation   page not found  msn msn back to msn home web search whoops this page doesn’t exist or can’t be found to find something you’ll like click a
