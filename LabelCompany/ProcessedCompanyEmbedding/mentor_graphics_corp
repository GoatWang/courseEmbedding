historyedit in  the idea of computeraided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups  those who founded mentor valid logic systems and daisy systems one of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of mentor whose backgrounds were in software development at tektronix ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications they felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the computer aided engineering cae programs they would build by february  most of the startup team had been identified by march the three executive founders tom bruggere gerry langeler and dave moffenbeier had left tektronix and by may the business plan was complete the first round of money  million came from sutter hill greylock and venrock associates the next round was  million from five venture capital firms and in april  a third round raised  million more mentor graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to oregon apollo computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform based in chelmsford apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of mentor graphics began their initial meetings when mentor entered the cae market the company had two technical differentiators the first was the software  mentor valid and daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses the second was the hardware  mentor ran all programs on the apollo workstation while daisy and valid each built their own hardware by the late s all eda companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as apollo and sun microsystems after a frenzied development the idea  product was introduced at the  design automation conference though in a suite and not on the floor as of  mentors major competitors are cadence design systems synopsys altium and zuken in june  cadence design systems offered to acquire mentor graphics in a leveraged buyout on  august  cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of mentor graphics board and management to discuss the offer mentor acquired flomerics group plc for  million in cash in october  and in august  mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company logicvision for  million in an allstock deal mentor completed the acquisition of valor computerized systems in march  in a cash and stock deal valued at  million on  february  carl icahn an activist investor made an offer to buy the company for

for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups  those who founded mentor valid logic systems and daisy systems one of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of mentor whose backgrounds were in software development at tektronix ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications they felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the computer aided engineering cae programs they would build by february  most of the startup team had been identified by march the three executive founders tom bruggere gerry langeler and dave moffenbeier had left tektronix and by may the business plan was complete the first round of money  million came from sutter hill greylock and venrock associates the next round was  million from five venture capital firms and in april  a third round raised  million more mentor graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to oregon apollo computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform based in chelmsford apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of mentor graphics began their initial meetings when mentor entered the cae market the company had two technical differentiators the first was the software  mentor valid and daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses the second was the hardware  mentor ran all programs on the apollo workstation while daisy and valid each built their own hardware by the late s all eda companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as apollo and sun microsystems after a frenzied development the idea  product was introduced at the  design automation conference though in a suite and not on the floor

announces new floefd product with unique capabilitiespr newswirenovember  reblogsharetweetsharewilsonville ore nov  prnewswire  mentor graphics corporation ment today announced the newest release of its leading frontloading computational fluid dynamics cfd floefd™ product targeting complex design challenges frontloading cfd refers to the practice of moving cfd simulation early into the design process enabling design engineers to examine and evaluate design options resulting in optimized product performance and reliability the new floefd product provides the industrys first simulation solution for water vapor absorption alongside several other lighting related functionalitiesview photoswith mentor graphics floefd product users can simulate complex design conditions including humidity absorption in solids within engineering timescalesmorewith the latest version of floefd software users can now simulate the sorption when one substance permeates another and desorption changing from an adsorbed state to a gaseous or liquid state processes for example plastic absorbs water and then releases it when environmental conditions change this functionality is important for several key markets such as automotive lighting design where moisture needs to be minimized in light housings other automotive lighting related capabilities include radiation and spectrum for direction source modeling and led thermaloptical modeling to simulate leds with nonlinear dependence of parameters on temperaturethe engineering team at sick ag has been using floefd successfully for several years said dr dirk spreeman project leader presence detection department in the research and development group at sick ag and now that the condensation functionality includes water vapor absorption in solids we will be able to include simulation in the design process for our light sensors as well to date we have been unable to access this information until after the first prototype has been built therefore we are very excited about gaining insight into the design earlier when we can modify it quickly and inexpensivelywhile we continue to make the software faster and more efficient the focus of floefd  is on power and the ability to handle even more complex taskslinked data from components often the design of complex devices assumes a multilevel simulation approach when analysis is initiated from a simple component followed by an assembly of components then finally the full system comprised of many components and subassemblies using the new floefd product users can move from level to level and reuse the component task definition of an assembly saving a great amount of time by eliminating the need to repeat component or subassembly definition users simply link to a previously created project in just seconds minimizing the risk of manual entry errors in addition users can create a library of components by saving model components with floefd conditions for future use to be shared with other designers in the organizationradiation and led enhancements the radiation modeling capability for floefd software has been further extended to include radiation pattern and spectrum definitions for directional sources the led thermaloptical model is now capable of simulating leds with nonlinear dependency of parameters on temperature these improvements are ideal for automotive lighting design and simulationtransient explorer the new method of results data compression saves large amounts of disk space while it provides access to transient data immediately users can combine the transient animation of plots and parameter charts into a single viewdesign of experiment doe and optimization true optimization of designs requires that multiple criteria be considered concurrently as such its implementation can consume substantial resources such as time and computing power with the addition of this functionality now users can take advantage of doe and response surface optimizationkorean localization floefd is now the only cfd software with user interfaces in japanese chinese french german russian english and now korean allowing engineers to experience floefd in their preferred languageour customers require fast and accurate simulation results for their complex engineering problems said roland feldhinkel general manager of mentor graphics mechanical analysis division our latest floefd product provides the power special functionality and performance required by engineers to obtain meaningful answers to their questions without

those who founded mentor valid logic systems and daisy systems one of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of mentor whose backgrounds were in software development at tektronix ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications they felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the computer aided engineering cae programs they would build by february  most of the startup team had been identified by march the three executive founders tom bruggere gerry langeler and dave moffenbeier had left tektronix and by may the business plan was complete the first round of money  million came from sutter hill greylock and venrock associates the next round was  million from five venture capital firms and in april  a third round raised  million more mentor graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to oregon apollo computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform based in chelmsford apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of mentor graphics began their initial meetings when mentor entered the cae market the company had two technical differentiators the first was the software  mentor valid and daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses the second was the hardware  mentor ran all programs on the apollo workstation while daisy and valid each built their own hardware by the late s all eda companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as apollo and sun microsystems after a frenzied

contents  history  locations  management  products  see also  references historyedit in  the idea of computeraided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups  those who founded mentor valid logic systems and daisy systems one of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of mentor whose backgrounds were in software development at tektronix ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications they felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the computer aided engineering cae programs they would build by february  most of the startup team had been identified by march the three executive founders tom bruggere gerry langeler and dave moffenbeier had left tektronix and by may the business plan was complete the first round of money  million came from sutter hill greylock and venrock associates the next round was  million from five venture capital firms and in april  a third round raised  million more mentor graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to oregon apollo computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform based in chelmsford apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of mentor graphics began their initial meetings when mentor entered the cae market the company had two technical differentiators the first was the software  mentor valid and daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses the second was the hardware  mentor ran all programs on the apollo workstation while daisy and valid each built their own hardware by the late s all eda companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as apollo and sun microsystems after a frenzied development the idea  product was introduced at the  design automation conference though in a suite and not on the floor as of  mentors major competitors are cadence design systems synopsys altium and zuken in june  cadence design systems offered to acquire mentor graphics in a leveraged buyout on  august  cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of mentor graphics board and management to discuss the offer mentor acquired flomerics group plc for  million in cash in october  and in august  mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company logicvision for  million in an allstock deal mentor completed the acquisition of valor computerized systems in march  in a cash and stock deal valued at  million on  february  carl icahn an activist investor made an offer to buy the company for about  billion in cash on  november  mentor graphics announced that it was to be acquired by siemens for  billion at

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no
