a weak competitive position in the industry we compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment labor and materials required to operate on those properties competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us accordingly these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties this advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties we also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies the presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity in addition we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available resources including but not limited to professional geologists land specialists engineers camp staff helicopters float planes mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs general competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation andor regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the republic of the philippines the united states and other countries as well as factors beyond our control including international political conditions overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration in the face of competition we may not be successful in acquiring exploring or developing profitable gold or mineral properties or interests and we cannot give any assurance that suitable gold or mineral properties or interests will be available for our acquisition exploration or development despite this we hope to compete successfully in the gold or mineral industry by  keeping our costs low  relying on the strength of our management’s contacts and  using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities company description we are a startup exploration stage company we have purchased a  interest in an  unit claim block the “palayan gold claim” containing

addition to this geological maps and assessment reports have helped to illustrate the mineral potential for the property lastly the palayan gold mine was visited in june   to further examine at least at a preliminary level any further exploration potential for the site and to provide recommendations for this report given the evidence presented in this report a recommended twophased exploration program has been provided at the conclusion it is strongly encouraged to be implemented in order to move forward with the project a total budget of php   has been provided as well which will be spent on aerial photos geological mapping geochemical soil sampling and geophysical surveying technical report of the palayan gold mine   introduction the palayan gold mine purchased in its entirety by palayan resources inc in  is located near nueva ecija philippines there are other mines in the area which have achieved significant production levels most notably the laur gold claim the laur gold claim kms northeast of the palayan gold mine has recently been conditionally reactivated and has produced in excess of  millions ounces of gold other mines in the area also proved productive having produced million ounces of between  and  this report aims to aptly describe the palayan gold mine including its general setting and productivity potential based on information gathered from existing literature provided by previous operators and exploration work much of the relevant information has been provided by palayan resources inc moving forward at the conclusion of this report is an outline for the recommended exploration please note that for the purpose of consistency and clarity metric units of measure will be used in this report and the currency references are in philippine pesos  property description and location      location palayan gold mine is located approximately  km northeast of cabanatuan city and  km north of gapan city and near nueve ecija philippines as previously mentioned the property is also relatively close to the laur gold claim which is  km to the northeast      property description included in the palayan project is  unpatented mineral claim located in the capital city of nueva ecija philippines at utm coordinates latitude º   north and longitude º   west verdasco enterprises llc assigned the mineral claim to palayan resources inc the transaction of which has been recorded with the nueva ecija provincial office of the department of environment and natural resources mines and geosciences of the republic of the philippines technical report of the palayan gold mine  to the authors knowledge there are no known encumbrances on the property nor are there any environmental concerns or developments in line for any part of the property  accessibility climate local resources infrastructure and physiography the palayan gold claim is located approximately km southwest of palayan city the capital of nueva ecija province in the philippines it is also about kms northwest of the more urban city of cabanatuan and manila is a fivehour drive away the property covers areas of placer and small to mid scale gold mining nueva ecija is the largest province in the eastern rim of central luzon bounded by the provinces of pangasinan and nueva viscaya in the north the province of tarlac in the west the provinces of pampanga and bulacan in the south and the province of aurora in the west completely landlocked the province starts at its low points in the southwestern marshes of the candaba swamps near the pampanga border and levels off north and eastward increasing in elevation to rolling hills closer to the mountains it is bordered on three sides by mountain ranges  sierra madre in the east caraballo in the north and cordillera in the west which provide protection from the monsoon storms during the months of july to october four large rivers  the pampanga river which cuts through the province rio chico along the tarlac boundaries diaman in the north and penaranda river in the south nourish nueva ecijas fertile farm lands the water resources of the region have been harnessed for use to irrigate farm lands to generate power for domestic and commercial use for aquaculture production and for recreational uses technical report of the palayan gold mine  nueva ecija is the center of agricultural research and production in the philippines it is known as the “rice bowl of the philippines” with rice corn and onion as its main agricultural products the area also grows mango banana eggplant and garlic other economic activities include cattle poultry and fish productions investments in trading manufacturing and agriculture related enterprises and products for export nonmetallic minerals resources such as gravel sand white clay black clay red clay bentonite quartz marble and feldspar have been discovered in the mountain and forest areas copper and manganese have been found in the municipalities of general tinio carranglan and patabangan the upper reaches of carranglan and palayan are currently being explored for gold deposits the province is also building a reputation in ecotourism agritourism and cultural tourism destination such as the minalungao national park rizal hot spring burburayok springs and pajanutic falls barrio puncan in the town of carranglan the central luzon state university and year round festivals help to promote those goals palayan city is classified as type ii climate zone characterized by distinct dry and wet seasons rainy season typically starts from may to early december with peak rainfall in the months of july and august the average amount of rain is  mm annually and peaks to around  mm in the month of august average temperature ranges °c to °c it is anticipated that exploration work and production can be carried out throughout the year although production may be slower during heavy monsoon rains the pantabangan dam stands as a feat of filipino engineering phenomenon providing ample power source irrigation and potable water to all the towns in the province of nueva ecija the pantabangan hydropower plant supplies  mw in addition to the  mw generated by the casecnan multipurpose irrigation and power project for province’s energy consumption needs the pampanga river which runs across the province of nueva ecija also provides irrigation to the rich farm lands generates hydroelectric power and minimizes flood damage to the area technical report of the palayan gold mine  transportation infrastructure in the area is modern and developed in that there is a network of allweather roads highways and bridges that make the highly property accessible currently road networks total about  km in length and there are  concrete bridges as well as  temporary bridges that connect palayan city to the rest of the province the maharlika highway runs through the heart of province which makes nueva ecija accessible from any of the surrounding provinces as well as the capital city of the country manila the highway also links to a system of roadways that connect the various municipalities and barangays to each other and to the rest of the province nueva ecija is home to six major bus depots that provide transport services to most major cities in luzon as far as the northern tip of the country apparri smaller public utility companies operate along the countryside there is sufficient commercial rural and government banking institutions that operate within the province to service personal and commercial banking needs and provide financing facilities for business and agriculture major telephone companies provide telecommunication facilities and telegram services tagalog is the main dialect spoken by  of nueva ecijas population  speak ilocano and  speak pampangeno a minority speaks pangasinan bicol and ilonggo  history there has been sufficient evidence of profitable mineralization throughout the areas adjacent to the palayan gold mine site eight prospects have already achieved significant production the most notable of which is the laur gold claim which produces  ounces of gold annually gold is reported to have also been discovered in the upper reaches of carranglan a municipality in the province of nueva ecija approximately  km north of palayan where several mining explorations are currently being conducted technical report of the palayan gold mine   geological setting and mineralization     regional geology central luzon is the longest area of lowlands and produces one third of the countrys total rice production where  of its total land area is devoted agriculture the lands of nueva ecija begin in the southwestern marshes near the pampanga border it levels off and then gradually increases in elevation to rolling hills as it approaches the mountains of sierra madre in the east and the caraballo and cordillera ranges in the north it is dominated by alluvial plain covering more than onehalf of the province the areas of high elevation are in the northern and eastern boundaries of the sierra madre cordillera and the caraballo mountains the sierra madre constitutes one continuous topographic unit that forms an almost northsouth trending block bordering the eastern boundary of the province of aurora the alluvial plain is gently undulating towards the east and rises abruptly to the sierra madre cordillera the main geomorphological feature of the central plain is between the gulf of lingayen and manila and this is where nueva ecija is found the lithology of the central plains are mostly composed of alluvium deposits formed by the agno river the most dominant lithology in the area are the late oligocene to pleistocene and quaternary alluvium deposited by the agno river geologically the plain of the province consists of recent alluvial deposits of various materials the depths of these deposits vary in many places depending on the elevation of the area the absence of gravel cobblestones and pebble in the substratum shows that these deposits were made by slowmoving streams the mountains in the northern part consist of tertiary undifferentiated rocks while those on the eastern sides consist of tertiary and later effusive rocks of rhyolites dacites and basalts the foothills on the western flank of sierra madre range consist of narrow strips of volcanic tuff material sandstone shales and limestones technical report of the palayan gold mine  the rock formation in the province is represented by time units ranging in age from precretaceous to quaternary    property geology and mineralization as previously mentioned eight prospects in the area surrounding the palayan gold mine have already achieved significant production this is because they as well the property in question sit atop a bedrock of native gold occurrences and numerous relatively small alluvial gold deposits mineralization was discovered in the area in the early s and since then has been the site of multiple small to midscale placer operations alluvial gold deposits appear to be widespread in the region and these types of deposits have been the main target of smallscale individual miners native gold is readily panned from the surrounding areas generally in areas of minor excavations and mine workings and also from creeks grains of native gold up to mm in size have been observed in rock samples from the project the following are the main stratigraphic units in the region    caraballo formation    pantabangan formation    guadalupe formation caraballo formation the caraballo formation is located in the northeastern part of san jose city nueva ecija it is the most extensively exposed rocks in the northern sierra madre previously designated as caraballo group and subdivided into formations i ii and iii this formation is composed of a proximal and distal volcanosedimentary facies and is dated in the late cretaceous to late eocene which is widely distributed in the caraballo mountains technical report of the palayan gold mine  the distal facies of the caraballo formation are wellexposed along the eastern side of the northern sierra madre range in divilacan bay west and south of dinapique south and east of san ildefonso peninsula and north of dingalan these facies consists of well bedded red and green mudstones siltstones sandstones and pyroclastic rocks with occasional fragmental flows and conglomerates on the western side of the northern sierra madre from san jose to digdig nueva ecija red and green siltstones and mudstones are overlain by gray to black tuffs and conglomerates which coarsen upwards and become intercalated with pillow basalts pantabangan formation the pantabangan formation is facing the highlands located east of san jose city nueva ecija this formation is a series of sandstone mudstone and polymictic conglomerates forming the gently rolling hills in the area of pantabangan basin a uniqueness separates this formation from the underlying palali and santa fe formations an increase in the amount of conglomerates towards the south and east suggests its origin from this direction the formation is believed to be partly equivalent to the pliopleistocene ilagan formation of the cagayan valley basin a dating of  ma pleistocene for a biotite extracted from an andesite intruding the pantabangan formation was found furthermore correlation of this formation to the tartaro formation on the western flank of the southern sierra madre dates as pliopleistocene from benthonic foraminifera it is estimated to attain a thickness of m guadalupe formation the guadalupe formation is found beneath the highland eastern parts of cabanatuan city nueva ecija it has been called the guadalupe tuffs or the guadalupe formation with a lower alat conglomerate member and an upper diliman tuff member the formation overlies miocene rocks and on the basis of the presence of stegodon fossils and other vertebrates remains leaf imprints and artifacts it is assigned a pleistocene age technical report of the palayan gold mine  the alat conglomerate was first mapped and named by alvir after marine littoral conglomerate exposed along sapang alat about  km north of the novaliches reservoir near novaliches town where it overlies miocene lavas the alat consists of massive conglomerate deeply weathered silty mudstone and tuffaceous sandstone the most common rock type the poorly sorted conglomerate consists of well rounded pebbles and small boulders of the underlying igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks cemented by a coarsegrained calcareous sandy matrix the interbedded sandstone is massive to poorlybedded tuffaceous fine  to medium grained looselycemented friable and exhibits cross bedding the mudstone is medium to thin bedded soft sticky silty and tuffaceous the maximum estimated thickness of this member is  m the whole series is flatlying medium to thin bedded and consists of fine grained vitric tuffs and welded pyroclastic breccias with minor fine to medium grained tuffaceous sandstone dark mafic minerals and bits of pumiceous and scoriaceous materials are dispersed in the glassy tuff matrix the thickness of the diliman tuff is  m tectonic setting the major structural element recognized in the area of nueva ecija is the dingalan cabaldon rift which is part of the philippine fault the fault appears to be the major factor that influences the formation of gabaldon valley it trends n ºw and branches out into numerous secondary faults of minor magnitude that the northeastern part cutting the cretaceouspaleogene rock series these secondary faults appear to have sliced the rocks into a series of parallel fault blocks the orientation of these faults together with the schistocity and fold axes appears to be closely related to the major northwest structure technical report of the palayan gold mine  the philippine fault zone is a major leftlateral strikeslip fault zone that has a mapped length of  km from the eastern part of mindanao to northern luzon slip on the philippine fault zone accommodates a significant portion of oblique convergence between the philippine sea and eurasian plates the philippine fault zone trends northwest from dingalan bay just east of gabaldon to the southern end of the central cordillera northwest of gabaldon the philippine fault splays into the digdig fault and the san jose fault the convergence rate of the philippine plate relative to eurasia falls in the range of  cmyr the movement is accommodated on three main parallel zones    the westward verging subduction zones running through the taiwan mindoro panay trenches          the philippine plate at the eastern side subducting westward along the philippine trench and          in between the two the philippine fault an active leftlateral strikeslip which runs from southern mindanao to northern luzon the subduction at the philippine trench and the philippine fault are young features initiated in late early pliocene probably in response to increasing blockage by collisions along eurasias boundary most of the oblique convergence would have since been partitioned between the two structures in luzon the south china sea plate is subducted eastward along the manila trench while at the eastern side the philippine trench is indented by the benham rise a strike slip fault zone along the east luzon trough borders the latter the area of northern luzon is wedged and compressed by the two opposing subduction zones there are few strong earthquakes that have historically affected luzon prior to the s earthquakes in the luzon area have severely affected nueva ecija recorded data shows that this section of the fault moved in the year  and in the year  technical report of the palayan gold mine       deposit types generally speaking there is a concentration of smallscale mine operations in nueva ecija the presence of quaternary volcanoes have made exploration profitable for smallscale operations it is estimated that the province has combined gold reserves of  million metric tons a total of  million metric tons is estimated as indicated ore reserves of which  million metric tons are deposited in and around palayan city and are distributed in barangays dona josefa palae and kabalugan indicated gold reserve in this region has a reported grade between  and  gram aumt and metal content is between  and  mt inferred gold ore reserve in nueva ecija for smallscale mining areas stands at  million metric tons this reserve has an average grade of  gram aumt metal content varies between  and mt      exploration from the research undertaken in order to write this report there is no record of any extensive exploration work or drilling has been conducted on the property      drilling the research shows that a number of properties to the northeast of the palayan gold mine were drilled in the late s by junior exploration companies but again to the authors knowledge no sites on the property in question have been drilled    sample preparation analyses and security any and all current exploration has been done so in accordance with modernly accepted procedures methods and practices preliminary samples have also been prepared in ways that adhere to current procedures technical report of the palayan gold mine  presently no comment on the quality of any samples taken can be presented appropriate measures of quality control were in place though no comment can be made on the lack of any additional measure of such controls there have been confirmed reports that communist rebels have been sighted near the borders of nueva vizcaya nueva ecija and aurora provinces near kasibu town where a number of mining exploration activities are ongoing the new peoples army the armed wing of the communist party of the philippines had made threats to mining companies who they view as exploiting the countrys natural resources the philippine army has given assurances that they will protect mining companies from communist guerillas notwithstanding a small force will be maintained to secure the property    adjacent properties at this time the author would like to stress that the adjacent properties discussed in this report have been cited as examples and evidence that the palayan gold mine has sufficient exploration potential as it may share similar mineralization by no means do these examples serve as significant factors to this report    interpretations and conclusions as it stands palayan resources inc is eager to proceed further with this project by beginning with more exhaustive preliminary exploration work on the palayan gold mine it has already been discussed that access to the palayan project site is straightforward via the well maintained highways and roadways personnel supplies and equipment can be transported by plane to manila and by trucks to the camp at the center of the property it should be reasonable to expect uninterrupted exploration work and production year round though both may have to slow down during monsoon season to date the property has shown mineral properties similar to those found in surrounding areas where there are past or presently successful mines therefore an intensive exploration program is strongly recommended in order to more clearly illustrate the production potential of the palayan gold mine at present time however the exact mineralization of the palayan gold mine has not been sufficiently explored as previous work has been inconsistent and limited technical report of the palayan gold mine  should the results of the twophased exploration program come back encouraging additional exploration and investment will be required to properly evaluate the property      recommendations    phase i and phase ii recommendations below is a outline including proposed budgetary expenses of the intensive exploration program recommended to be undertaken on the palayan gold mine site the first phase consists of aerial photography to locate structures and understand the topography detailed geological mapping of the region in addition to the palayan gold mine in order to more broadly understand its geological setting geophysical survey using magnetic and electromagnetic instrumentation of both the region and main area for exploration geochemical soil sample of the property to determine areas of most significant mineral wealth and more exactly determine the mineralization of the site implemented as a whole the proposed exploration program is quite intensive and examines all aspects of the property results from such a program should help determine the exact mineralization of the property in addition to whether a subsequent work such as a diamond drill program is justifiable technical report of the palayan gold mine     recommended exploration budgets the proposed budget for preliminary exploration is php  and is broken down as into several areas phase i       geological mapping php      geophysical surveying php      total phase i php      phase ii       geochemical surveying and surface
