khoso please go ahead khoso baluch thanks josh good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on our call today during this call the team and i will lay out the progress we have made over the last several months across multiple fronts against a backdrop of changing market conditions including updates on our current phase  study and ongoing communications with the fda the four areas we will cover are the following our recent financing and update on the ongoing lockit  clinical trial of neutrolin in patients with endstage renal disease receiving hemodialysis through central venous catheters the advancement in our taurolidinebased development pipeline and progress in our european commercialization of neutrolin under our ce mark as you know we are focused on bringing neutrolin our broadspectrum nonantibiotic antiinfective solution designed to prevent costly and dangerous bloodstream infections associated with the use of central venous catheters to the us market to that end we recently completed a public offering of shares and warrants with gross proceeding totaling us  million that will be used to continue the development of neutrolin in the ongoing lockit  and the second and final lockit  phase  clinical studies our chief medical officer dr judith abrams will provide an update to our us clinical program for neutrolin in just a few minutes for now i will say that our patient enrollment rates remained strong and as we stated in our recent trial update we anticipate exceeding our original enrollment target of  patients by the fourth quarter of  as we await clarity from the ongoing discussions with the fda regarding possible prospective change to the lockit  trial protocol related indiscernible to the apparent overall lower baseline rate of catheter related blood stream infection events i am pleased that our continued surveillance and strategic activation of new clinical trial sites have kept our enrollment on track an independent data and safety monitoring board recently completed a planned safety review of lockit  clinical trials and unanimously concluded that safe to continue the trial as designed these results are consistent with our safety experience with neutrolin in europe we are pleased that the results of this safety review are in line with neutrolin’s anticipated product profile as a well tolerated and have the potential to reintroduce catheter related infections with a planned interim data safety monitor board review behind us efficient enrollment of hemodialysis patients remain our top focus we are making every effort to facilitate a potential interim analysis of the lockit  data by the end of the year which is dependent upon a payment of a prerequisite number of blood stream infections in the study we are hopeful that we can reach this important milestone as planned for the end of  calendar year which will give us our first look in the us at neutrolin’s potential ability to reduce catheter related blood stream infections in patient with endstage renal disease receiving hemodialysis to a central venous catheters in addition to enhancing neutrolin in the us last month we announced exciting news that we had secured our first european commercial collaboration with hemotech a french company based in toulouse to launch and market neutrolin throughout france and french overseas territories i will elaborate on this shortly but first i’d like to turn the call over to bob cook our chief financial officer for the financial update bob bob cook thanks very much khoso the company will shortly be filing its q for the quarter ended march   my financial report today largely compares our results for the first quarter  versus the fourth quarter  except where comparisons with the first quarter  are necessary are useful standard financial metrics i urge you to read the information contained in the q report for a more complete explanation of our financial results with respect to our first quarter  financial results our net loss was approximately  million or  per share compared with a net loss of  million or  per share for the first quarter  our net loss in the fourth quarter  was  million or  per share operating expenses in the first quarter  were  million compared with  million in the fourth quarter of  the increase in operating expenses compared with the previous quarter was due to a  million or  increase in rd expense and  million or  increase in ga expense the growth in rd expense in the first quarter was led by a  million or  increase in clinical trial expense and a  million or  increase in other rd expense primarily manufacturing and employee costs during the quarter we continue to increase our patient enrollment rates in the lockit  clinical trial intensified our neutrolin cmc efforts hired our new chief medical officer and additional clinical staff and converted some of our consultants to employee status we expect rd expense to continue to increase from present levels over the next several quarters due to the pace of enrollment in the lockit  trial and through certain other cmc activities ga expense growth from the fourth quarter of  was led by a  million increase in stockbased compensation plus smaller increases in consulting and accounting fees and employee costs our cash used in operations in the first quarter  was  million compared with  million in the fourth quarter  cash was used primarily to conduct our phase  study of neutrolin other rd and related ga activities our operating cash burn was funded primarily via drawdown of our cash on hand approximately  million was provided by the use of our atm during the month of january  as khoso mentioned we recently completed a public offering of common stock and warrants resulting in gross proceeds of approximately  million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses the offering included the full exercise of hc wainwright and co’s option to purchase additional shares of common stock and warrants from cormedix this offering closed last week on may  as of march  the company had cash and shortterm investments of approximately  million based on our first quarter  cash burn this amount of cash would have been sufficient to fund the company’s operations for approximately six months which we judge an uncomfortably short and risky time period further as we expect our cash burn to increase significantly over the balance of the year primarily as a result of the pace of enrollment in the lockit  trial required cmc expenses and the planned commencement of the lockit  trial we concluded that without timely access to additional funding we might be forced to quartile patient enrollment and hence jeopardize the timing of our anticipated milestones in addition to potentially increasing the duration of the clinical trial and possibly delaying the nda filing any enrollment related delay would certainly increase the cost of the clinical trial over and above any resulting from our proposed protocol changes we surveyed the market during the first quarter seeking indications of interest and a financing of a size that would enable us to avoid returning for additional funding for at least several months we then paused our financing efforts temporarily when we concluded that we would advise the market of the apparent overall lower rate of blood stream infections that was observed in the trial as well as our ongoing discussions with fda concerning potential protocol changes to address this and other issues this work took several weeks to complete ultimately resulting in our april  trial update press release once back on track we confronted a market that had softened due to a high level of issuance we were disappointed by the terms of the offering and then by the stocks post the transaction performance but we closed the transaction nevertheless because we judged that forgoing the additional cash would impact our ability to raise cash in the future and would slow the momentum we had gained in the clinical trial we believe that with the milestones upcoming over the next several months there will be opportunities for the stock to regain ground lost over the last few weeks given the significant cost of the current lockit clinical trial and the anticipated start of our lockit  trial by year end our cash and short term investments at march  and the net proceeds from the recent financing are unlikely to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next  months however as a result of the financing we have lengthened our cash runway and assuming the one year warrant issued as part of the financing are exercised prior to the respiration we will obtain additional cash that can be used to partially fund our cash requirements in  once we gain clarity with respect to the adoption of the proposed protocol amendments we will be able to adjust our forecast and determine with a higher degree of confidence on future cash requirements it’s now my pleasure to introduce our chief medical officer dr judith abrams who is joining our call for the first time to give you a more detailed update on our lockit  trial currently underway judith judith abrams thank you bob it is my pleasure to participate on today’s call and provide an update on neutrolin’s us clinical program as khoso mentioned the independent data safety and monitoring board unanimously concluded that it was safe to continue the lockit  clinical trial as designed this recommendation was based upon the valuation of data from the first  patients randomized into this event driven clinical trial we recently announced that cormedix is engaged in discussions with the fda regarding possible perspective changes to the lockit  protocol in part to account for an apparent overall lower baseline rate of catheterrelated blood stream infection events as these discussions remain ongoing we will provide further detail on the possible protocol amendments following conclusion of a discussion with the fda as we stated in our most recent trial update we currently anticipate patient enrollment to exceed the originally targeted total of  patients and patient enrollment may continue into the second quarter of  to enable us obtain a final planned number of requisite catheterrelated blood stream infection events if the requisite number of catheterrelated blood stream infection events are obtained within this protected timeframe top line results from the lockit  clinical trial would be anticipated around year end  following the conclusion of the patient safety observation period as khoso mentioned we are making every effort to enroll additional patients as efficiently as possible to meet these milestones in parallel we are pleased that the fda accepted our proposal to include one or more interim efficacy analyses for the lockit  clinical trial as ongoing the original trial protocol did not include any such analyses these planned interim efficacy analyses should allow us to obtain our first look in the us at neutrolin’s potential ability to reduce catheterrelated blood stream infections in patients with endstage renal disease receiving hemodialysis through a central venous catheter the timing of the interim analyses is also event driven but we currently anticipate that the first interim analysis may occur as early as the fourth quarter of  pending attainment of the number of catheterrelated blood stream infection event we look forward to providing timely update on the status of the lockit  trial as well as a timing of potential interim analyses we remain entirely focused on the successful completion of the neutrolin registration program and agreeing neutrolin to market in the us our goal and the goal of health organizations around the world is to eliminate costly and potentially deadly catheterrelated blood stream infections altogether we believe based on its broad spectrum antimicrobial activity that neutrolin can help achieve this goal upon potential improvement with that i’d like to hand the call back to khoso for a discussion of our development pipeline based on taurolidine the active component of neutrolin khoso khoso baluch thank you judith while our main focus remains on gaining us approval of neutrolin we are continuing to take advantage of additional opportunities to generate value for cormedix based on quality we’ve discussed our preliminary efforts in the medical device space where taurolidine maybe incorporated into various medical and surgical materials to confirm antimicrobial and antiinflammatory properties we’ve also discussed our ongoing work with poetic consortium to combine taurolidine with other chemotherapies targeting cancer on the medical device front based on initial feasibility work in a number of different areas we have made the strategic decision to focus our effort on investigating the incorporation of taurolidine into surgical measures suture materials and hydrogels we view this opportunity as the lowhanging fruits in an attractive market where we believe taurolidine infused products could have significant impact i won’t go into details on this call as we plan to schedule a more robust rd day event to discuss our taurolidine based pipeline within the coming months but we currently expect to pursue the development of antimicrobial sutures for use following surgery and wound care nanofiber mesh to provide antimicrobial structure support for burns and hernia repair and antimicrobial hydrogels to prevent infections and promote healing of burns and diabetic foot ulcers once we’ve demonstrated proof of concept in vitro and in animal models we will look to establish strategic partnerships to take these programs to the next stage along the k pathway we will look to leverage the relatively shorter development pathway for medical devices to bring near term value to cormedix as i mentioned we are preparing to discuss our current and planned pipeline activities in greater detail at an upcoming live meeting we expect this event to take place in new york but will be webcast and archived on our website for all to listen we will advise you on when that meeting will be taking place as soon as it is scheduled before i discuss our progress in commercializing neutrolin in europe i like to hand the call to tony pfaffle the chief scientific officer to talk about our recent work exploring the use of taurolidine to combat an emerging fungal pathogen that is concern in hospitals across the globe tony tony pfaffle thanks khoso candida auris or c auris is a fungus a species of pathogenic yeast that has emerged over the past few years as a serious global health threat according to the centers for disease control it is responsible for severe illness as well as life threatening blood stream and wound infections and hospitalized patients worldwide certain strains are resistant to all nature classes of antifungal drugs something that has not been seen before and other species of candida c auris has been shown to inhabit and persist on surfaces in healthcare environments in the form of resistant biofilm and can readily spread between patients making it even more difficult to control of greatest relevance to cormedix is that the cdc has reported that patients with central venous catheters are among those at greatest risk of infection with c auris which can enter the blood stream and spread throughout the body causing serious invasive infections as you know taurolidine is the active antimicrobial component of our catheter lock solution neutrolin which is specifically designed to prevent this kind of blood stream infection caused by an infected central venous catheter based on the mechanism of action of taurolidine and the fact that it has been shown to be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi including multidrug resistant strains we set out to test taurolidine against candida auris to see if it could have a beneficial impact on the significant threat to global hospitals we partnered with the premier microbiology and antimicrobial surveillance laboratory jmi labs to conduct the sensitivity testing they found that candida auris strains including clinical isolates provided by the cdc were  inhibited by taurolidine in vitro as the concentration currently contained in neutrolin which has been shown to be safe in all clinical studies to date while preliminary these results are very encouraging because taurolidine’s potential efficacy against this deadly pathogen could add value across our entire pipeline sensitivity of c auris to be taurolidine contained in neutrolin may effectively reduce or prevent catheter related blood stream infections caused by this important pathogen with potentially positive implications for europe where neutrolin is a ce mark product as well as in the us upon potential approval by the food and drug administration beyond neutrolin however if we can demonstrate that the taurolidine contains in our sutures meshes and hydrogels currently in development is also effective against c auris we may be able to prevent or treat c auris infections following surgery in burns and in diabetic foot ulcers we look forward to determining a path to work with global regulatory agencies to leverage the benefits of taurolidine and to help prevent resistant microbial infections with that i’ll hand the call back to khoso to discuss our commercial efforts for neutrolin in europe thank you khoso baluch thanks tony as i mentioned cormedix secured our first european commercial collaboration with hemotech to launch and market neutrolin throughout france and french overseas territories this landmark european agreement enables cormedix to leverage hemotech nearly  years of experience delivering high quality products to the hemodialysis community hemotech is the perfect partner to offer an innovative product like neutrolin in these territories based on a significant presence across multiple clinic settings it’s reach includes  of all french dialysis organizations as well at major hospitals where neutrolin’s ce mark allows it to be marketed as a catheter lock solution for oncology and icu patients with central venous catheters we expect this initial commercial collaboration to enable cormedix to begin augmenting our commercial presence in europe we intend to pursue additional partnerships that design to further expand ex us sales of neutrolin with the expectation that we will begin to generate initial sales revenues in the quarters to come which may overtime partially offset our operational and clinical development cost in the us we look forward to providing updates as we form commercial partnerships in additional ex us territories in conclusion cormedix remained focus on the success of our phase  clinical program to secure fda approval of neutrolin in the us in the phase of mounting antibiotic resistant bacterial infections the development and approval of a novel antimicrobial is important now more than ever this is why we are dedicated to bringing neutrolin to the market to help prevent potentially deadly catheter related blood stream infections in already vulnerable patient population let me say that i too i’m disappointed with our current stock price however our recent financing add fuel to continue our pivotal clinical program which will benefit from both fda fast track providing the potential for priority review of our marketing application and the qidp designation which secures up to  years of market exclusivity upon potential approval in parallel we are advancing our pipeline beyond neutrolin to include multiple medical device opportunities as well as therapeutic use of taurolidine in often oncology indications in short we are moving along various pathways to increase value for cormedix and its shareholders and we look forward to providing the next update with that we can now move to the qa portion of the call thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today is coming from ram selvaraju from rodman and renshaw please proceed with your question raghuram selvaraju hi i have one detailed question and two very minor ones the detailed question pertains to the potential format of the proposed interim analyses in the lockit  study could you give us a sense of how these analyses might compare to the final top line data with respect to the types of endpoints you expect to use is there going to be no difference and is it simply just question of the number of events that are going to be the subject of the interim analyses or are there nuances that we should be aware of and then with respect to the recent disclosure that taurolidine has been shown to be active against candida auris can you give us some additional background on this multidrug resistant organism have there been any cases of c auris reported in the hospital setting in the united states as of yet when was the first case reported in europe i believe it was in london in late  but correct me if i’m wrong and what do you anticipate being the relative incidents in prevalence of this organism in the context of blood stream infection specifically and then bob i just had one clarificatory question for you in the sga line item for this quarter could you give us a breakdown of how much of that number was directly related to selling as opposed to ga thank you khoso baluch hey raj thanks very much for your question so what i would do is for first question i’m going to ask judith to help on so related to the interim question the second of c auris i’m going to ask tony to elaborate and then as you’ve already decided it’s going to be bob so bob will do the third one so let’s first begin with judith judith judith abrams hi raj i understand your question you asked about the format of the interim analysis and in particular how it compares to the final top line that it provides to the analyses plan so the interim analysis is going to be on a portion of the study population and it will look at the primary study endpoint as well as the safety and will give us the dsmb will be doing this on our behalf and we’ll give us an indication as to how to proceed with the study khoso baluch all right tony raghuram selvaraju thank you tony pfaffle yes so you’re correct in europe the uk in  reported a significant number of cases since then the us cdc has reported cases with highest prevalence in new york new jersey illinois and indiana with a significant number of cases in new york so the department of health new york state department of health is targeted as a major pathogen to be dealt with the first reported case was in japan in  and since then it’s been reported in nine countries over four continents it’s more concerning because it’s resistant to flu console ph and most all isolates  resistance to indiscernible and about  resistance to amphotericin b so it’s mdr multidrugresistant pathogen and that’s why both cdc and the state health departments are laser focused on addressing this concern and one of the major issues is catheter related blood stream infection so that’s why we are looking forward to helping address this issue khoso baluch thank you tony bob is it third question bob cook yes raj thanks very much for giving me the easiest one your question i think related to what number or how much within the total sga expense line related to selling expenses and the answer is the number is very small it’s between  and  so it’s pretty much as meaningless which is generally why in my comments i forget to mention the selling part and just stop it by ga raghuram selvaraju okay thank you i’ll jump back in the queue thank you khoso baluch thanks operator thank you our next question is coming from ed white from fbr and company please proceed with your question ed white hi yes it’s fbr and company so just a few questions first as far as the marketing agreement in europe and in france when will you see the first impact to your sales number is it this quarter next quarter is it late  then the next question is just you had mentioned the lockit  and i’m just curious if you can pin down more of a date of when that will start and what the study will look like thirdly you did mention and i’m glad to see it the other potential products in surgical measures in management et cetera when will you start – i know you certainly are going to go over to the rd there so maybe you don’t want to answer it but just when can we see some preclinical data and do you expect to partner right after that before first inhuman and the lastly if i can just question for bob regarding the diluted share count now after the deal what that level is now and also when you’re talking about the cash run away did i hear you right to say that even with the race you’re not going to make it through  so we should expect another race between now and then thanks for the question khoso baluch okay so let me begin with taking the first three questions that you posed ed so the marketing agreement in france basically they have started the launch of it the tail end of april so we should begin to see sales during this quarter and so that will now begin to come again it will start slow and it will pick up as we go quarterbyquarter going forward your second question about lock  with the recent activities we have had with lock  and our refinancing at the moment we still have work to do on lock  so at the moment i’m seeing it for us to start something by the tail end of this year we will be able to provide more update once we have finalized our ongoing discussions with the fda on lock  the third question as you talked about the pipeline the rd data we will have which i expect will be happening over the next few months and i’m talking off potentially two or three months you’re going to see the feasibility work that we have already done with the sutures the hydrogels the meshes so you’re going to see that work in parallel we are doing further improving the efficiency of the technology that we’ve got there plus completing the animal models and our goal will be that when we do have the rd date we will share more details about when to expect each of these different data points to be coming but all of them should take place during  for your fourth question i’m going to hand it over to bob about the diluted share bob cook yes so ed before the offering we had – there was about  million shares outstanding and we issued in the offering another  million so the diluted count following the offering that would put us at according to my numbers here my math  million ed white and when that was fully diluted that includes warrants bob cook no it doesn’t we haven’t done that i haven’t done more calculation because we technically haven’t issued those warrants yet so i have to go back and look at that but i don’t have that number of the top of my head ed white okay thank you that was the number that i was looking for okay thank you bob cook okay we can get that to you the other thing with respect to the cash the simple answer is no the existing cash does not get us to the end of  if you look at the amount of cash that we spent in the first quarter it was  million right and on a pro forma basis our existing cash at march  was  million and another  million from the offering so that’s  million so that indicates that we have about four quarters of cash if our burn rate was to continue at the same level as the first quarter so that by itself does not get us to the end of  and then on top of that we are expecting the burn to increase as the costs for the clinical trial increase but i don’t have good numbers on that because we are still working that out based on what the patient levels are going to look like so that’s the best we can do for the moment and i think we need to look – we need to consider based on the current burn and what the current cash is to give us a sense really of what the needs are and whether that’s true another race or some other opportunity remains to be seen i mean there is certainly no rush at this point to go and do anything new so we’ll just be assessing the options that we have and we do have the preclinical stuff that khoso has been talking about there could be things that happen there so there is a lot of opportunities that could happen between now and the time that it would be necessary to look at having more cash in the bank ed white okay great thanks and then just a last question when will you know what the final enrollment or what you believe will be the final enrollment numbers for lockit  khoso baluch judith judith abrams well we are in active dialogue with the fda and we should know by the third quarter of this year all the final details regarding the protocol and the size ed white okay great thanks for taking my questions khoso baluch thank you ed judith abrams thanks ed operator thank you our next question today is coming from gail collins ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified analyst yes thanks for taking my question i’d like to know why the infection rate is so low khoso baluch judith judith abrams so the infection rate is actually consistent with what we see in the published literature and it’s with a very broad range and the infection rate is changing overtime as more rigorous management of these patients is brought to bear and also in the clinical trial setting that may have had an impact but what look like we are observing a presence as well within the range of what’s reported in the population operator thank you our next question today is coming from evan fraser ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified analyst hi thank you i would like to know how many infections have occurred in the study so far khoso baluch judith judith abrams yes these kinds of details we don’t discuss because of the potential for introducing bias in an ongoing clinical trial it’s a great question and we look forward to sharing all those data with you as the trial comes to conclusion unidentified analyst okay operator thank you our next question today is coming from larry stammen ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified analyst yes hi thanks i wanted to know if you have enough cash to finish the phase  trials and if not how much more cash and time will be required until you get the fda approval khoso baluch okay bob bob cook i mean again the answer is that at this point it’s safe to say that we do not have enough cash to finish the phase  programs with edges to few minutes ago we walked through how far the current cash is going to take us the current plan at this point would be to start a second phase  trial at the end of this year which would go into i think early  although that still remains to be seen and the fact at this point we don’t have a hard and fast number for what the total cost of the phase  development program is going to be because we haven’t caused about – we still have a lot of work to do with respect to the lockit  trial and although we have given estimates for the lockit  between the  million to  million range with the anticipated changes in the trial that we are in the process of making that estimate is likely to change as well and certainly it’s going to be the  million level whereabouts rather than the  million so i think we’ll have some clarity on this over the next several months but at the current time i just don’t have a number that i can put out with any confidence that could be correct operator thank you we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments khoso baluch thank you very much thanks everyone for joining this call this afternoon very much looking forward to hearing and seeing many of you during our rd day that we will cover our pipeline i think you will be intrigued by the information we will be sharing with you during the rd day so thank you once again for joining us and have a good evening byebye operator thank you that does conclude
