horror’ stephen king with a staggering output of short stories novellas and novels hollywood has been eager to adapt many of his ideas and books the dark tower is meant to be stephen king’s ‘lord of the rings’ style magnum opus it was initially published in five instalments in the magazine of fantasy and science fiction between  and  this is the first trade hardback copy and king and the publisher anticipated slow sales only due to the fantasy nature of the story rather than his usual horror appeal that is why the print run was only  copies  of which about  copies were misbound as a comparison ‘the shining’ and his debut novel ‘carrie’ had a prin run of  and  respectively for july  a movie adaptation has been announced titled ‘the dark tower’ starring idris alba and matthew david

undertaken in my lifeim a diehard stephen king fan im the constant reader the kind that would read the kings laundry list i read all of his books many times usually within days of release except the

disappointed you can see how young king and old kings writing differs so greatly in both plot and language young king is tightly disciplined highly structured no unnecessary and distracting insertions thats really about the writers ego than of service to the story by this final book i caught myself rolling my eyes frequently at unnecessary author intrusions to the story and plot which is getting weirder and weirder all the time like a bad psychedelic trip even the way the characters speak to each other doesnt flow with the natural ease and seamless belief in his old books with frequent author intrusions about what eddie or roland or whoever is like eg we might as well look at him a bit more closely we wont take long for pimli prentiss isnt central to our tale of roland  is this necessary my good man just tell the tale and leave the narrator out of it let your characters speak for themselves by the end of song of susannah i could barely follow the narrative with real immersion i

tower seriesbymichaelon december  format kindle editionverified purchasewith the dark tower movies beginning to take shape it seems logical to assume there will be a resurgence of people wanting to see what these books are all about i started book  about  months ago and rolands journey just ended for me several minutes ago in fact youre most likely going to read horrible reviews on here how stephen king dropped the ball and this book is a hopeless letdown my personal opinion of the matter is this book is quite simply the best of the entire series the pacing revelations surprises and twists absolutely never let up from traveling under caste discordia to having dinner with dandelo i was completely enthralled from beginning to end the last  pages or so of the book are your call to make what you will of how everything wraps up personally it isnt how i wanted the story to end but that in no way devalues the absolutely brilliant  of it this series is my adult harry potter series i will cherish these stories and will be reading rolands journey to the tower again for you ears to comecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert

now please try again later out of  starsthe ending legitimately made me angrybyvéronique bellamyon march  format mass market paperbackverified purchasewarning there are spoilers ahead if you want to avoid them read just my first paragraph and the titlei love the dark tower series i read through all seven books and im rereading the series now and doing it with wind through the keyhole in its proper place between books    it was a book and a series that kept me riveted though the ending pissed me off i understand that there probably was no way king could have ended the story the dark tower was built up so much throughout the series that it would have taken something spectacular to live up to it really anything would have been a letdown the ending was cheap but as far as letdowns go this made me angry legitimately angrybut how else was it supposed to end life isnt always accompanied by a happy ending life isnt always a field of roses i think too often we dont appreciate this and instead prefer to have sunshine blown up our butts  the ending is sad its gritty and while there is hope one cant finish the book without saying wtf kingcomment one person found this helpful was this

in to comment showing  commentssort by newest oldest there was a problem loading comments right now please try again later out of  starsthe beginning of the endbyamazon queenon march  format kindle editionverified purchasewhen i first read this last installment of the dark tower series i absolutely raged at the ending i had a fit complete with nasty words and a hurled book i waited all these years for this butthis series has ever lured me in starting  years ago or so when i was  and first read the gunslinger i have read the series countless times the connections between stories and characters that i have loved and this world are a source of endless fascination for me i always seem to stumble upon someone or something that i had thought was lost from another storyor another world if you like that better this series makes you feel as though nothing really is ever finished or lost forever there is always another door or hopethroughout the years stephen king has alluded to feeling driven by this story compelled that it wont be ignored afterwords and introductions refer to this feeling over and over again it makes you wonder really how wonderful and terrible if that is the case as a reader its easy to say yeah yeah im sure its a real burden but what happens next because you are gan so cough it up likely with an unfriendly poke but really think about that for a minute if a story could burn and demand and keep you awake in the dark hours of the night i dont know about anyone else but that might just drive me out of my everloving mind and if ever there was a tale that would demand it is this onespoiler alertin regards to the deaths of the katet well we all knew it was coming eddies death was the first but sent the flare that the tet was broken the job they were drawn for done when he died we knew that they were all fair game it seems unfair that he had suffered so much only to be the first to fall and in such a crappy way a moment of inattention and then the end to lose jake again was hard harder than i had imagined when he was sacrificed under the mountains we had barely come to know him so while it was a lousy way to go it was easier to bear than his last death after we had stood with him for so many miles and oy his death had been foreseen in the glass back in book  but still a hard blow you were almost glad for him though oy was ready to move on to find jakeas to the endwell yes from a readers point of view that was a major bummer we all want to see sacrifice rewarded a happy ending a circle closed so i had my tantrum and stomped my feet then went back and read it againand again in the reading i started to wonder the quest for the tower maybe wasnt about letting your friends fall but about falling for them in that respect roland failed miserably from hax the cook all the way to oy he allowed his friends to fall on his quest for the tower when he climbs the stairs he thinks that the tower is a tower of death and the tower replies that it is because rolands life has made it sowe as readers are left with another door though the horn that hangs at rolands belt tells us that maybe just maybe hell get it right

dark towerbyb marshallon april  format kindle editionverified purchasepart of the dark tower series by stephen kinghighly recommended too bad i could not give  stars the gunslinger  introduction to the last gunslinger roland this book was wonderful it introduces you to some of the characters of the series and gives you the gunslingers quest  the drawing of the three  roland pulls future gunslingers jake eddie and suzannah from our world over to his i really enjoyed how this was done the characters are very likeable especially oy  the wastelands  the gunslingers make continue on their way blaine really is a pain  wizard and glass  roland tells them the story of susan the girl at the window a very sad thing that happened to him in childhood a beautiful story  wolves of the calla  the gunslingers help a town that is about to have their children taken jake makes a friend his own age a character from another king book is met this book was well put together  song of suzannah  this one tells of something that suzannah is going through  the dark tower  the quest is finally over the tower is reached but who will make it there believe it or not this book made me cry  the wind through the keyhole  this story takes place between some of the other books it is roland and his gang taking refuge from a storm and roland telling stories to pass the time the stories are beautifully writtenall of the stories in this series are exceptional i love how they flow together it really does seem like one continuous bookcomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to

market paperbackverified purchasethere is so much to say and yet i am at a loss for words finishing this book this series was amazing and saddening at the same time i would say that this epic was life changing but that is to strong of a statement however any other statement would not do this series justice i couldnt stop thinking about these books every time i set it down in the back of my mind was the constant thought of the tower will roland finally make it to his lifes goal and journey to the top of the tower will his katet continue to support his journey or will madness over take them all this series was by far the best epic story line i have ever read and that is saying something i have read epics like lord of the rings and harry potter but this in my opinion is better on so many levelsthis book is the final chapter in the tower series and one of the best books i have ever read it is a very close second to my all time favorite book but almost ties for the  spot now it could partially be the fact that i have read six other books just to get to this point and it is my favorite because it is the end in truth it is due to the fact that it is the longest book i have ever read at  pages and i flew through this as if it was a short novel when i would read i wouldnt be able to put it down unless i fell asleep from exhaustion or work required me to it was amazingly well written and suspenseful and engaging from the very beginning there were parts that i wished were a bit longer but when i went back and realized it took several long chapters and a large page count i realized i fell into the story and got lost in the actionthere is so much i want to say about this but it will give away to much of what is in other books and i hate spoilers in reviews all i can really do now is send out my heartfelt desire for everyone to read this whether they like it or not it seems like it should be something everyone should read at some point in their lives much like most of the other epic stories out there love it or hate it i loved it and hope that if this review gets one more person to journey with roland and his katet to the dark tower i will have fulfilled a need to pass on the wonder of these bookscomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not

series i tried to read the green mile  years ago but i just couldnt get into it so i put it down and thought maybe stephen king just wasnt for me i was very wrongmy brother is the only reason i picked these books up he had read them more than twice and really loved them and he said he just wanted someone else to read them so he had someone to talk to about them i only started the gunslinger because he sent it home with me one day it didnt really grab me like other books i had read but he promised the next book was better he was right it was better but i was still not hooked like what i thought i would beit took me a year to finish the wastelands and then i started wizard and glass something in this book captivated me i dont know if i had finally made a connection with the characters or if it opened my eyes to a better understanding of roland but when i finished it i couldnt wait to start the next book i finished them all in about a month and then went back and read the gunslinger againi have a new found respect for stephen king and i think he might be one of the greatest literary minds of our time seriously i am amazed at the worlds his imagination has created for others to get lost init took me a year to finish the wastelands and then i started wizard and glass something in this book captivated me i dont know if i had finally made a connection with the characters or if it opened
