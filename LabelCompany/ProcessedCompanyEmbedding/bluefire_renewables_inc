confined to producing ethanol from corn sugar  until now our technogy history technology  projects click here to view the enlarged flowchart the production of chemicals by fermenting various sugars is a wellaccepted science its use ranges from producing beverage alcohol and fuelethanol to making citric acid and xantham gum for food uses however the high price of sugar and the relatively low cost of competing petroleumbased fuel have kept the production of chemicals mainly confined to producing ethanol from corn sugar – until now the company has developed significant proprietary improvements to a wellknown conversion technology known as concentrated acid hydrolysis such that the process is ready for commercial implementation the technology is unique in that for the first time it enables widely available cellulosic materials or more commonly biomass to be converted into sugar in an economically viable manner thereby providing an inexpensive raw material for fermentation or chemical conversion into any of a hundred different specialty andor commodity chemicals biomass feedstocks include agricultural residues straws corn stalks and cobs bagasse cotton gin trash palm oil wastes etc crops grown specifically for their biomass grasses sweet sorghum fast growing trees etc paper recycled newspaper paper mill sludge’s sorted municipal solid waste etc wood wastes prunings wood chips sawdust etc and green wastes leaves grass clippings vegetable and fruit wastes etc green wastes leaves grass clippings vegetable and fruit wastes etc the ability to utilize low cost feedstock andor those that command tipping fees to produce products that sell into highly efficient markets provides a viable business that can be sited in almost any geographic area urban or rural due to its moderate use of thermal energy the production of minimal waste streams its significant environmental benefits and minimal permitting requirements the technology also makes an ideal “thermal host” for cogeneration facilities the technology development history – it has been known for over  years that acids act as catalyst to convert “hydrolyze” cellulose and hemicellulose into simple sugars hexose and pentose or “c and c” sugars the germans and russians used this simple procedure in the early part of this century to produce alcohol fuels and chemicals from wood in order to supply their war efforts during this same period a similar plant was operated in the united states in oregon however they all shared a similar characteristic – they were not economically competitive with low cost petroleum products because of poor yields high wastage and the large volume of unmarketable byproducts except for a few plants in russia the technology fell out of use after world war ii however interest in the conversion of biomasstosugars picked up in the mid ’s due to the oil embargo and the united states’ desire to lessen its dependence on foreign chemical and fuel feedstocks further interest was stirred in  when dupont published an article in science magazine detailing the variety of chemical products that could be produced via fermentation of sugar since that time many universities and government laboratories have been studying the hydrolysis of cellulose either through the application of various acids or enzymes most notable in regard to acid hydrolysis had been the work undertaken at the tennessee valley authority and mississippi state university in  arkenol as a related company to ark energy began researching several technologies in order to develop thermal hosts for siting in conjunction with ark energy power plant projects that were being bid into local utilities arkenol determined that the concentrated acid hydrolysis process could be made economically viable through the use of new technology modern control methods and newer materials of construction engineers and their consultants were able to solve the problems with the following proprietary improvements that now make the process economically viable efficient acid recovery and reconcentration high sugar concentration at high purity the ability to ferment c and c sugars efficiently with conventional microbes the ability to handle silica in biomass feedstocks and all byproducts are usable and marketable project developments bluefire is currently in the process of developing two cellulosic ethanol facilities in lancaster california and fulton mississippi the fullypermitted and shovelready lancaster facility bluefire’s first us commercial plant will use postsorted cellulosic wastes diverted from southern california’s landfills to produce approximately  million gallons of fuelgrade ethanol per year bluefire is in the detailed engineering phase for its second commercial plant in fulton ms which will produce approximately  million gallons of ethanol per year from woody biomass mill residue and other cellulosic waste these two planned facilities will create more than  construction jobs and once in operation more than  new operations and maintenance jobs this is in addition to the hundreds of jobs created or maintained at equipment vendors and suppliers that will be involved in the company’s other projects bluefire renewables recently announced that the department of energy has determined that bluefire has met the requirements necessary for phase i completion of the application process for its loan guarantee and that the company has been invited to continue on to phase ii for the financing of their fulton ms project the process to demonstrate the efficacy of the technology arkenol constructed and operated a pilot plant near its southern california offices for roughly five years since  the technology has been successfully used by an unrelated independent and internationally recognized corporation to produce ethanol for the japanese transportation fuel market over the last  years the initial testing on a vast array of potential feedstock has been completed both in the us and at various locations throughout the world the core technology and other related processes are protected under patents issued and pending by the us patent and trademark office an integrated fullscale commercial process plant consists of six basic unit operations feedstock preparation decrystallizationhydrolysis reaction vessel solidsliquid filtration separation of the acid and sugars fermentation of the sugars product purification simply put the process separates the biomass into its main constituents cellulose and hemicellulose the main building blocks of plant life and lignin the “glue” that holds the building blocks together then converts the cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars ferments them and purifies the fermentation liquids into products these unit operations require a series of material and energy inputs to produce the primary products of fermentation and the resultant byproducts if there is no power plant present from which to obtain steam the production facility would use natural gas or lignin as fuel for its own boilers incoming biomass feedstocks are cleaned and ground to reduce the particle size for the process equipment the pretreated material is then dried to a moisture content consistent with the acid concentration requirements for decrystallization separation of the cellulose and hemicellulose from the lignin then hydrolyzed degrading the chemical bonds of the cellulose to produce hexose and pentose sugars at the high concentrations necessary for commercial fermentation insoluble materials principally the lignin portion of the biomass input are separated from the hydrolyzate by filtering and pressing and further processed into fuel or other beneficial uses the remaining acidsugar solution is separated into its acid and sugar components by means of chromatographic separation bluefire uses commercially available ion exchange resins to separate the components without diluting the sugar the separated sulfuric acid is recirculated and reconcentrated to the level required by the decrystallization and hydrolysis steps the small quantity of acid left in the sugar solution is neutralized with lime to make hydrated gypsum caso · ho an insoluble precipitate which is readily separated from the sugar solution and which also has beneficial use as an agricultural soil conditioner at this point the process has produced a clean stream of mixed sugars both c and c for fermentation in an ethanol production plant naturallyoccurring yeast has been specifically cultured by a proprietary method to ferment the mixed sugar stream is mixed with nutrients and added to the sugar solution where it efficiently converts sugars to fermentation beer an ethanol yeast and water mixture and carbon dioxide the yeast culture is separated from the fermentation beer by a centrifuge and returned to the fermentation tanks for reuse ethanol is separated from the now clear fermentation beer by conventional distillation technology dehydrated to  proof with conventional molecular sieve technology and denatured with unleaded gasoline to produce the final fuelgrade ethanol product the still bottoms containing principally water and unfermented pentose sugar is returned to the process for economic water use and for further conversion of the pentose

power “unless the lord builds the company we labor in vain who build it” the real power of bluefire arnold klann founder  ceo bluefire ethanol “unless the lord builds the company we labor in vain who build it” psalms  as ceo of bluefire ethanol i spend most of my time guiding and promoting the company to its final destiny of being the solution to man’s pollution and supplying the best transportation energy for the world i talk to stakeholders all over the globe from strategic partners in europe and asia pacific to engineers in omaha about how to produce the lowest cost fuels and maximize carbon credits in the market i talk to investors about the political and economic environment around alternative fuels and why our approach is the best investment i talk to shareholders about how bluefire is uniquely positioned to become the world leader in biofuels production and explain the strategic direction of the company and the return on investment they can expect as a result of my leadership these are the types of discussions that fill the day of the typical ceo there is another discussion i have daily that is not typical of ceos i seize every opportunity to talk about the real power of bluefire what do i mean by real power what do the words stand for how does this concept influence my leadership of the company real power is my stand for the following beliefs… the company vision was supplied by god my decisions and actions must be guided by god all of the glory goes to god the company vision was supplied by god in september  i received a vision and a mandate manage the energy resources of the earth according to god’s design take a moment to imagine what god’s intended design for energy resources would be if we would just follow god’s mandate to use the resources properly it would lead to peace and prosperity today we are running out of low cost petroleum it is a finite resource because most oil is produced in areas of the world that are politically unstable at best and dangerous at worst the usa spends billions of dollars a year protecting supply with its military because the world is growing economically the demand for more oil is outstripping supply so competition is increasing and nonindigenous oil producing nations are spending more of their gdp on energy this is destroying the ability of nations to grow and for their populations to feed themselves yet most countries that don’t produce oil are agrarian based by redirecting the agricultural model in these countries by increasing food production and creating an energy resource crop to offset their oil imports it keeps more of the countries gdp incountry for economic development the key to economic growth is to create a consumer base this can only be accomplished when the population has money to buy consumables beyond food that requires jobs and industry bluefire does all these things by first creating a supply chain for feedstock to its production plants by enabling farmers to grow energy crops that also produce food and can be used for export beyond internal consumption second by producing a compatible transportation fuel for the country from the feedstock it offsets capital that flows out of the country to buy oil thereby keeping the money in country for industrial development third bluefire can produce chemicals beyond fuels that would create the feedstock for the next industry like biodisposable plastics or food additives like citric acid in the garden of eden it was all about agrarian growth let’s go back to god’s model at bluefire we believe that the company’s purpose is to create the opportunities for change that can make a difference in the lives and economies of nations through the deployment of technologies that can be low tech yet at the same time create new opportunities for the indigenous population by giving farmers and the lowest economic level of the population the opportunity to earn more money and increase personal productivity leads to the increase for the whole nation bluefire changes the paradigm from a petro based econometric model to an agrarian based econometric model and the possibilities for the nation are endless just like god had originally intended the countries are no longer held hostage to oil bluefire’s nearterm mission is to free the us from the turmoil and crisis of being held hostage by oil producing nations our longterm mission is to improve the living conditions of impoverished people in the developing world i have participated in mission trips and have ministered to families living in waste dumps in places like tepic nargarit mexico the philippines indonesia and elsewhere as a pastor and graduate of cottonwood leadership college i see the vision and have the heart to help and change the conditions of the people society values the least bluefire’s technology deployment will immediately improve their living conditions through employment and at the same time we will create a sustainable econometric model to lift them out of the dumps–literally–and help them break free of economic bondage and the spiritual oppression that comes with it my decisions and actions are guided by god my primary job is to ensure that the investment made in the company is put to the best possible use to grow the company and manage its success this includes the investment of hard work and creativity from the team of people that work for the company the investment of prayer from those who believe in us and are committed to our success and the investment of those who finance the company this is a huge responsibility to prepare myself for this responsibility i completed the program at cottonwood christian leadership college this training prepared me to make decisions based on biblical principles and minister to those who seek to establish a closer relationship with god all the glory goes to god our team is very experienced and has been successful in commercializing technologies and running companies in the past but it is god that uses us and gives this company success as senior management and employees of bluefire we see ourselves as god’s agents here on earth to implement his
