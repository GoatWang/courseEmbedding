studied law and soon went into politics associating himself with the most advanced movements writing articles for the syndicalist journal le peuple and directing the lanterne for some time from this he passed to the petite république leaving it to found lhumanité in collaboration with jean jaurès activismedit at the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions and at the congress of working men at nantes in  he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of jules guesde from that time briand was one of the leaders of the french socialist party in  after several unsuccessful attempts he was elected deputy he declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the left in what was known as the bloc in order to check the reactionary deputies of the right from the beginning of his career in the chamber of deputies briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state he was appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the  law on separation and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders he succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied he was the principal author of the law of separation but not content with preparing it he wished to apply it as well the ministry of maurice rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property a clause of the law for which briand was not responsible consequently he accepted the portfolio of public instruction and worship in the sarrien ministry  so far as the chamber was concerned his success was complete but the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the unified socialist party march  as opposed to jaurès he contended that the socialists should cooperate actively with the radicals in all matters of reform and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals he himself was atheist he became a freemason in the lodge le trait dunion in july  while the lodge didnt record his name in spite of his repeated requests the lodge declared unworthy to him on  september  in  he joined the lodge les chevaliers du travail that was established in  prime minister of franceedit portrait of aristide briand prewaredit briand served as minister of justice under clemenceau in  before succeeding clemenceau as prime minister on  july  serving until  march  in social policy briand’s first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in april  for workers and farmers pensions that same year compulsory sickness and oldage insurance was introduced for  million rural and urban workers however a law court decision in  that questioned the legality of compulsion “enabled a large proportion of employers and workers to evade the law” briand again served as minister of justice  under the premiership of the rightwinger raymond poincaré soon to become president of the republic before again becoming prime minister for a few months from  january  until  march  first world waredit edit at the end of august  following the outbreak of the first world war briand again became minister of justice when rené viviani reconstructed his ministry in the winter of  briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to salonika in the hope of helping serbia and perhaps bringing greece romania bulgaria and italy into the war as a profrench bloc which would also act as a barrier to future russian expansion in the balkans he got on well with lloyd george who was also contrary to military advice keen for operations in the balkans and had a long talk with him on  february  briand was the main mover in persuading maurice sarrail to accept the salonika command in august  in october  following an unsuccessful french offensive and the entry of bulgaria briand again became prime minister  october  succeeding rené viviani he also became foreign minister for the first time a post held by théophile delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government he was also pledged to “unité de front” not just between the military and parliament but also closer links with the other allies a pledge met with “prolonged thunderous applause” by the deputies draft proposals for allied cooperation prepared by lord esher and maurice hankey were on the table by the time british prime minister h h asquith visited paris on  november mainly to discuss greece and only his second wartime talks with france the first had been with viviani in july  the opening weeks of briands ministry required him to broker an agreement between general gallieni the new war minister and general joffre newly  december promoted to “commanderinchief of the french armies” generalissimo over all theatres apart from north africa edit in the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the german attack at verdun  february  gallieni read an angry report at the council of ministers on  march criticising joffres conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control then resigned he was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed general roques was appointed after it had been ensured that joffre had no objections the first formal allied conference met in paris on  march  italy did not participate but initially made little impact perhaps because briand had vetoed the british suggestion of a permanent secretariat or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of anglofrench talks in the last quarter of  one of which the chantilly meeting had already seen strategy plans drawn up late in march  joffre and briand blocked the withdrawal of five british divisions from salonika briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress princess george queen of greece in the spring of  briand urged sarrail to take the offensive in the balkans to take some of the heat off verdun although the british preoccupied with the upcoming somme offensive declined to send further troops and sarrail’s offensive that summer was not a success briand also attended the conference at saleux on  may  about the upcoming anglofrench offensive on the somme with president poincaré on whose train it was held general foch commander army group north and the british commanderinchief general haig the first secret session of the chamber of deputies was held in june  to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at verdun the government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding “effective supervision” of the army the parliamentary army commission elected abel ferry as a commissioner  august by october ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways to joffre’s fury late in  roques had been sent on a factfinding mission to salonika after britain italy and russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander sarrail to briand’s and joffre’s surprise roques returned recommending that sarrail be reinforced and that sarrail no longer report to joffre coming on the back of the disappointing results of the somme campaign and the defeat of romania roques’ report further discredited briand and joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies’ demands for a closed session in november ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower a secret session was held on  november about calling up the class of  followed by another a week later on  november briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commanderinchief in northern france with both he and sarrail reporting to the war minister although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation the closed session began on  november and lasted until  december briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government and in a speech of  november he promised to repeal joffres promotion of december  and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government briand survived a confidence vote by  six months earlier he had won a confidence vote  reconstructed governmentedit on  december briand formed a new government reducing the size of the council of ministers from  to  and replacing roques with general lyautey that day his government survived a vote of confidence by  votes and joffre was appointed generalinchief of the french armies technical adviser to the government consultative member of the war committee he was persuaded to accept by briand but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on  december with nivelle replacing him as commanderinchief of the armies of the north and northeast a senate secret session on  december attacked briands plans for a smaller war cabinet as “yet another level of bureaucracy” on  december briand pledged that he would continue to push for a “permanent allied bureau” to secure constant cooperation between the allied nations briands reduced war cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by lloyd george just appointed prime minister of britain but in practice briands often met just prior to meetings of the main cabinet painlevé declined the job of war minister as he would have preferred petain as commanderinchief rather than the inexperienced nivelle like president poincaré briand had thought petain too cautious to be suitable nivelles appointment caused great friction between the british and french high commands after lloyd george attempted to have haig placed under nivelles command at the calais conference in january briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in london – march  to resolve the matter briand resigned as prime minister on  march  as a result of disagreements over the prospective nivelle offensive to be succeeded by alexandre ribot sedit briand returned to power in  he supervised the french role in the washington naval conference of – three factors guided the french strategy and necessitated a mediterranean focus the french navy needed to carry a great many goods the mediterranean was the axis of chief interest and a supply of oil was essential the primary goal was to defend french north africa and briand made practical choices for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy the conference agreed on the american proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of  to  to  for the united states britain and japan with italy and france allocated  each frances participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human material and financial resources briands efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the germans failed in the wake of german intransigence and he was succeeded by the more bellicose raymond poincaré in the wake of the ruhr crisis however briands more conciliatory style became more acceptable and he returned to the quai dorsay in  he would remain foreign minister until his death in  during this time he was a member of  cabinets three of which he headed himself briand negotiated the briandceretti agreement with the vatican giving the french government a role in the appointment of catholic bishops kellogg–briand pactedit main article kellogg–briand pact aristide briand and gustav stresemann aristide briand received the  nobel peace prize together with gustav stresemann of germany for the locarno treaties austen chamberlain of the united kingdom had received a share of the peace prize a year earlier for the same agreement a  proposal by briand and united states secretary of state frank b kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the pact of paris aka the kellogg–briand pact the cordial relations between briand and stresemann the leading statesmen of their respective countries were cut short by the unexpected death of stresemann in  and of briand in  briand plan for european unionedit as foreign minister briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of europe described as briands locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of francogerman rapprochement it was his answer to germanys quick economic recovery and future political power briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a european union in the league of nations on  september  and in  in his memorandum on the organization of a regime of european federal union for the government of france the idea was to provide a framework to contain frances former enemy while preserving as much of the  versailles settlement as possible the briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of europe and the provision of political security to eastern europe against soviet threats the basis was economic cooperation but his fundamental concept was political for it was political power that would determine economic choices the plan under the memorandum on the organization of a system of european federal union was in the end presented as a french initiative to the league of nations with the death of his principal supporter german foreign minister gustav stresemann and the onset of the great depression in  briands plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after world war ii that eventually resulted in the european union

studied law and soon went into politics associating himself with the most advanced movements writing articles for the syndicalist journal le peuple and directing the lanterne for some time from this he passed to the petite république leaving it to found lhumanité in collaboration with jean jaurès activismedit at the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions and at the congress of working men at nantes in  he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of jules guesde from that time briand was one of the leaders of the french socialist party in  after several unsuccessful attempts he was elected deputy he declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the left in what was known as the bloc in order to check the reactionary deputies of the right from the beginning of his career in the chamber of deputies briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state he was appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the  law on separation and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders he succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied he was the principal author of the law of separation but not content with preparing it he wished to apply it as well the ministry of maurice rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property a clause of the law for which briand was not responsible consequently he accepted the portfolio of public instruction and worship in the sarrien ministry  so far as the chamber was concerned his success was complete but the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the unified socialist party march  as opposed to jaurès he contended that the socialists should cooperate actively with the radicals in all matters of reform and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals he himself was atheist he became a freemason in the lodge le trait dunion in july  while the lodge didnt record his name in spite of his repeated requests the lodge declared unworthy to him on  september  in  he joined the lodge les chevaliers du travail that was established in  prime minister of franceedit portrait of aristide briand prewaredit briand served as minister of justice under clemenceau in  before succeeding clemenceau as prime minister on  july  serving until  march  in social policy briand’s first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in april  for workers and farmers pensions that same year compulsory sickness and oldage insurance was introduced for  million rural and urban workers however a law court decision in  that questioned the legality of compulsion “enabled a large proportion of employers and workers to evade the law” briand again served as minister of justice  under the premiership of the rightwinger raymond poincaré soon to become president of the republic before again becoming prime minister for a few months from  january  until  march  first world waredit edit at the end of august  following the outbreak of the first world war briand again became minister of justice when rené viviani reconstructed his ministry in the winter of  briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to salonika in the hope of helping serbia and perhaps bringing greece romania bulgaria and italy into the war as a profrench bloc which would also act as a barrier to future russian expansion in the balkans he got on well with lloyd george who was also contrary to military advice keen for operations in the balkans and had a long talk with him on  february  briand was the main mover in persuading maurice sarrail to accept the salonika command in august  in october  following an unsuccessful french offensive and the entry of bulgaria briand again became prime minister  october  succeeding rené viviani he also became foreign minister for the first time a post held by théophile delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government he was also pledged to “unité de front” not just between the military and parliament but also closer links with the other allies a pledge met with “prolonged thunderous applause” by the deputies draft proposals for allied cooperation prepared by lord esher and maurice hankey were on the table by the time british prime minister h h asquith visited paris on  november mainly to discuss greece and only his second wartime talks with france the first had been with viviani in july  the opening weeks of briands ministry required him to broker an agreement between general gallieni the new war minister and general joffre newly  december promoted to “commanderinchief of the french armies” generalissimo over all theatres apart from north africa edit in the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the german attack at verdun  february  gallieni read an angry report at the council of ministers on  march criticising joffres conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control then resigned he was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed general roques was appointed after it had been ensured that joffre had no objections the first formal allied conference met in paris on  march  italy did not participate but initially made little impact perhaps because briand had vetoed the british suggestion of a permanent secretariat or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of anglofrench talks in the last quarter of  one of which the chantilly meeting had already seen strategy plans drawn up late in march  joffre and briand blocked the withdrawal of five british divisions from salonika briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress princess george queen of greece in the spring of  briand urged sarrail to take the offensive in the balkans to take some of the heat off verdun although the british preoccupied with the upcoming somme offensive declined to send further troops and sarrail’s offensive that summer was not a success briand also attended the conference at saleux on  may  about the upcoming anglofrench offensive on the somme with president poincaré on whose train it was held general foch commander army group north and the british commanderinchief general haig the first secret session of the chamber of deputies was held in june  to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at verdun the government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding “effective supervision” of the army the parliamentary army commission elected abel ferry as a commissioner  august by october ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways to joffre’s fury late in  roques had been sent on a factfinding mission to salonika after britain italy and russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander sarrail to briand’s and joffre’s surprise roques returned recommending that sarrail be reinforced and that sarrail no longer report to joffre coming on the back of the disappointing results of the somme campaign and the defeat of romania roques’ report further discredited briand and joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies’ demands for a closed session in november ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower a secret session was held on  november about calling up the class of  followed by another a week later on  november briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commanderinchief in northern france with both he and sarrail reporting to the war minister although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation the closed session began on  november and lasted until  december briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government and in a speech of  november he promised to repeal joffres promotion of december  and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government briand survived a confidence vote by  six months earlier he had won a confidence vote  reconstructed governmentedit on  december briand formed a new government reducing the size of the council of ministers from  to  and replacing roques with general lyautey that day his government survived a vote of confidence by  votes and joffre was appointed generalinchief of the french armies technical adviser to the government consultative member of the war committee he was persuaded to accept by briand but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on  december with nivelle replacing him as commanderinchief of the armies of the north and northeast a senate secret session on  december attacked briands plans for a smaller war cabinet as “yet another level of bureaucracy” on  december briand pledged that he would continue to push for a “permanent allied bureau” to secure constant cooperation between the allied nations briands reduced war cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by lloyd george just appointed prime minister of britain but in practice briands often met just prior to meetings of the main cabinet painlevé declined the job of war minister as he would have preferred petain as commanderinchief rather than the inexperienced nivelle like president poincaré briand had thought petain too cautious to be suitable nivelles appointment caused great friction between the british and french high commands after lloyd george attempted to have haig placed under nivelles command at the calais conference in january briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in london – march  to resolve the matter briand resigned as prime minister on  march  as a result of disagreements over the prospective nivelle offensive to be succeeded by alexandre ribot sedit briand returned to power in  he supervised the french role in the washington naval conference of – three factors guided the french strategy and necessitated a mediterranean focus the french navy needed to carry a great many goods the mediterranean was the axis of chief interest and a supply of oil was essential the primary goal was to defend french north africa and briand made practical choices for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy the conference agreed on the american proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of  to  to  for the united states britain and japan with italy and france allocated  each frances participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human material and financial resources briands efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the germans failed in the wake of german intransigence and he was succeeded by the more bellicose raymond poincaré in the wake of the ruhr crisis however briands more conciliatory style became more acceptable and he returned to the quai dorsay in  he would remain foreign minister until his death in  during this time he was a member of  cabinets three of which he headed himself briand negotiated the briandceretti agreement with the vatican giving the french government a role in the appointment of catholic bishops kellogg–briand pactedit main article kellogg–briand pact aristide briand and gustav stresemann aristide briand received the  nobel peace prize together with gustav stresemann of germany for the locarno treaties austen chamberlain of the united kingdom had received a share of the peace prize a year earlier for the same agreement a  proposal by briand and united states secretary of state frank b kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the pact of paris aka the kellogg–briand pact the cordial relations between briand and stresemann the leading statesmen of their respective countries were cut short by the unexpected death of stresemann in  and of briand in  briand plan for european unionedit as foreign minister briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of europe described as briands locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of francogerman rapprochement it was his answer to germanys quick economic recovery and future political power briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a european union in the league of nations on  september  and in  in his memorandum on the organization of a regime of european federal union for the government of france the idea was to provide a framework to contain frances former enemy while preserving as much of the  versailles settlement as possible the briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of europe and the provision of political security to eastern europe against soviet threats the basis was economic cooperation but his fundamental concept was political for it was political power that would determine economic choices the plan under the memorandum on the organization of a system of european federal union was in the end presented as a french initiative to the league of nations with the death of his principal supporter german foreign minister gustav stresemann and the onset of the great depression in  briands plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after world war ii that eventually resulted in the european union

studied law and soon went into politics associating himself with the most advanced movements writing articles for the syndicalist journal le peuple and directing the lanterne for some time from this he passed to the petite république leaving it to found lhumanité in collaboration with jean jaurès activismedit at the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions and at the congress of working men at nantes in  he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of jules guesde from that time briand was one of the leaders of the french socialist party in  after several unsuccessful attempts he was elected deputy he declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the left in what was known as the bloc in order to check the reactionary deputies of the right from the beginning of his career in the chamber of deputies briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state he was appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the  law on separation and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders he succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied he was the principal author of the law of separation but not content with preparing it he wished to apply it as well the ministry of maurice rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property a clause of the law for which briand was not responsible consequently he accepted the portfolio of public instruction and worship in the sarrien ministry  so far as the chamber was concerned his success was complete but the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the unified socialist party march  as opposed to jaurès he contended that the socialists should cooperate actively with the radicals in all matters of reform and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals he himself was atheist he became a freemason in the lodge le trait dunion in july  while the lodge didnt record his name in spite of his repeated requests the lodge declared unworthy to him on  september  in  he joined the lodge les chevaliers du travail that was established in  prime minister of franceedit portrait of aristide briand prewaredit briand served as minister of justice under clemenceau in  before succeeding clemenceau as prime minister on  july  serving until  march  in social policy briand’s first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in april  for workers and farmers pensions that same year compulsory sickness and oldage insurance was introduced for  million rural and urban workers however a law court decision in  that questioned the legality of compulsion “enabled a large proportion of employers and workers to evade the law” briand again served as minister of justice  under the premiership of the rightwinger raymond poincaré soon to become president of the republic before again becoming prime minister for a few months from  january  until  march  first world waredit edit at the end of august  following the outbreak of the first world war briand again became minister of justice when rené viviani reconstructed his ministry in the winter of  briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to salonika in the hope of helping serbia and perhaps bringing greece romania bulgaria and italy into the war as a profrench bloc which would also act as a barrier to future russian expansion in the balkans he got on well with lloyd george who was also contrary to military advice keen for operations in the balkans and had a long talk with him on  february  briand was the main mover in persuading maurice sarrail to accept the salonika command in august  in october  following an unsuccessful french offensive and the entry of bulgaria briand again became prime minister  october  succeeding rené viviani he also became foreign minister for the first time a post held by théophile delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government he was also pledged to “unité de front” not just between the military and parliament but also closer links with the other allies a pledge met with “prolonged thunderous applause” by the deputies draft proposals for allied cooperation prepared by lord esher and maurice hankey were on the table by the time british prime minister h h asquith visited paris on  november mainly to discuss greece and only his second wartime talks with france the first had been with viviani in july  the opening weeks of briands ministry required him to broker an agreement between general gallieni the new war minister and general joffre newly  december promoted to “commanderinchief of the french armies” generalissimo over all theatres apart from north africa edit in the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the german attack at verdun  february  gallieni read an angry report at the council of ministers on  march criticising joffres conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control then resigned he was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed general roques was appointed after it had been ensured that joffre had no objections the first formal allied conference met in paris on  march  italy did not participate but initially made little impact perhaps because briand had vetoed the british suggestion of a permanent secretariat or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of anglofrench talks in the last quarter of  one of which the chantilly meeting had already seen strategy plans drawn up late in march  joffre and briand blocked the withdrawal of five british divisions from salonika briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress princess george queen of greece in the spring of  briand urged sarrail to take the offensive in the balkans to take some of the heat off verdun although the british preoccupied with the upcoming somme offensive declined to send further troops and sarrail’s offensive that summer was not a success briand also attended the conference at saleux on  may  about the upcoming anglofrench offensive on the somme with president poincaré on whose train it was held general foch commander army group north and the british commanderinchief general haig the first secret session of the chamber of deputies was held in june  to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at verdun the government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding “effective supervision” of the army the parliamentary army commission elected abel ferry as a commissioner  august by october ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways to joffre’s fury late in  roques had been sent on a factfinding mission to salonika after britain italy and russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander sarrail to briand’s and joffre’s surprise roques returned recommending that sarrail be reinforced and that sarrail no longer report to joffre coming on the back of the disappointing results of the somme campaign and the defeat of romania roques’ report further discredited briand and joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies’ demands for a closed session in november ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower a secret session was held on  november about calling up the class of  followed by another a week later on  november briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commanderinchief in northern france with both he and sarrail reporting to the war minister although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation the closed session began on  november and lasted until  december briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government and in a speech of  november he promised to repeal joffres promotion of december  and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government briand survived a confidence vote by  six months earlier he had won a confidence vote  reconstructed governmentedit on  december briand formed a new government reducing the size of the council of ministers from  to  and replacing roques with general lyautey that day his government survived a vote of confidence by  votes and joffre was appointed generalinchief of the french armies technical adviser to the government consultative member of the war committee he was persuaded to accept by briand but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on  december with nivelle replacing him as commanderinchief of the armies of the north and northeast a senate secret session on  december attacked briands plans for a smaller war cabinet as “yet another level of bureaucracy” on  december briand pledged that he would continue to push for a “permanent allied bureau” to secure constant cooperation between the allied nations briands reduced war cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by lloyd george just appointed prime minister of britain but in practice briands often met just prior to meetings of the main cabinet painlevé declined the job of war minister as he would have preferred petain as commanderinchief rather than the inexperienced nivelle like president poincaré briand had thought petain too cautious to be suitable nivelles appointment caused great friction between the british and french high commands after lloyd george attempted to have haig placed under nivelles command at the calais conference in january briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in london – march  to resolve the matter briand resigned as prime minister on  march  as a result of disagreements over the prospective nivelle offensive to be succeeded by alexandre ribot sedit briand returned to power in  he supervised the french role in the washington naval conference of – three factors guided the french strategy and necessitated a mediterranean focus the french navy needed to carry a great many goods the mediterranean was the axis of chief interest and a supply of oil was essential the primary goal was to defend french north africa and briand made practical choices for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy the conference agreed on the american proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of  to  to  for the united states britain and japan with italy and france allocated  each frances participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human material and financial resources briands efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the germans failed in the wake of german intransigence and he was succeeded by the more bellicose raymond poincaré in the wake of the ruhr crisis however briands more conciliatory style became more acceptable and he returned to the quai dorsay in  he would remain foreign minister until his death in  during this time he was a member of  cabinets three of which he headed himself briand negotiated the briandceretti agreement with the vatican giving the french government a role in the appointment of catholic bishops kellogg–briand pactedit main article kellogg–briand pact aristide briand and gustav stresemann aristide briand received the  nobel peace prize together with gustav stresemann of germany for the locarno treaties austen chamberlain of the united kingdom had received a share of the peace prize a year earlier for the same agreement a  proposal by briand and united states secretary of state frank b kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the pact of paris aka the kellogg–briand pact the cordial relations between briand and stresemann the leading statesmen of their respective countries were cut short by the unexpected death of stresemann in  and of briand in  briand plan for european unionedit as foreign minister briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of europe described as briands locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of francogerman rapprochement it was his answer to germanys quick economic recovery and future political power briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a european union in the league of nations on  september  and in  in his memorandum on the organization of a regime of european federal union for the government of france the idea was to provide a framework to contain frances former enemy while preserving as much of the  versailles settlement as possible the briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of europe and the provision of political security to eastern europe against soviet threats the basis was economic cooperation but his fundamental concept was political for it was political power that would determine economic choices the plan under the memorandum on the organization of a system of european federal union was in the end presented as a french initiative to the league of nations with the death of his principal supporter german foreign minister gustav stresemann and the onset of the great depression in  briands plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after world war ii that eventually resulted in the european union

references  external links early lifeedit he was born in nantes loireatlantique of a petit bourgeois family he attended the nantes lycée where in  he developed a close friendship with jules verne he studied law and soon went into politics associating himself with the most advanced movements writing articles for the syndicalist journal le peuple and directing the lanterne for some time from this he passed to the petite république leaving it to found lhumanité in collaboration with jean jaurès activismedit at the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions and at the congress of working men at nantes in  he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of jules guesde from that time briand was one of the leaders of the french socialist party in  after several unsuccessful attempts he was elected deputy he declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the left in what was known as the bloc in order to check the reactionary deputies of the right from the beginning of his career in the chamber of deputies briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state he was appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the  law on separation and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders he succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied he was the principal author of the law of separation but not content with preparing it he wished to apply it as well the ministry of maurice rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property a clause of the law for which briand was not responsible consequently he accepted the portfolio of public instruction and worship in the sarrien ministry  so far as the chamber was concerned his success was complete but the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the unified socialist party march  as opposed to jaurès he contended that the socialists should cooperate actively with the radicals in all matters of reform and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals he himself was atheist he became a freemason in the lodge le trait dunion in july  while the lodge didnt record his name in spite of his repeated requests the lodge declared unworthy to him on  september  in  he joined the lodge les chevaliers du travail that was established in  prime minister of franceedit portrait of aristide briand prewaredit briand served as minister of justice under clemenceau in  before succeeding clemenceau as prime minister on  july  serving until  march  in social policy briand’s first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in april  for workers and farmers pensions that same year compulsory sickness and oldage insurance was introduced for  million rural and urban workers however a law court decision in  that questioned the legality of compulsion “enabled a large proportion of employers and workers to evade the law” briand again served as minister of justice  under the premiership of the rightwinger raymond poincaré soon to become president of the republic before again becoming prime minister for a few months from  january  until  march  first world waredit edit at the end of august  following the outbreak of the first world war briand again became minister of justice when rené viviani reconstructed his ministry in the winter of  briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to salonika in the hope of helping serbia and perhaps bringing greece romania bulgaria and italy into the war as a profrench bloc which would also act as a barrier to future russian expansion in the balkans he got on well with lloyd george who was also contrary to military advice keen for operations in the balkans and had a long talk with him on  february  briand was the main mover in persuading maurice sarrail to accept the salonika command in august  in october  following an unsuccessful french offensive and the entry of bulgaria briand again became prime minister  october  succeeding rené viviani he also became foreign minister for the first time a post held by théophile delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government he was also pledged to “unité de front” not just between the military and parliament but also closer links with the other allies a pledge met with “prolonged thunderous applause” by the deputies draft proposals for allied cooperation prepared by lord esher and maurice hankey were on the table by the time british prime minister h h asquith visited paris on  november mainly to discuss greece and only his second wartime talks with france the first had been with viviani in july  the opening weeks of briands ministry required him to broker an agreement between general gallieni the new war minister and general joffre newly  december promoted to “commanderinchief of the french armies” generalissimo over all theatres apart from north africa edit in the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the german attack at verdun  february  gallieni read an angry report at the council of ministers on  march criticising joffres conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control then resigned he was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed general roques was appointed after it had been ensured that joffre had no objections the first formal allied conference met in paris on  march  italy did not participate but initially made little impact perhaps because briand had vetoed the british suggestion of a permanent secretariat or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of anglofrench talks in the last quarter of  one of which the chantilly meeting had already seen strategy plans drawn up late in march  joffre and briand blocked the withdrawal of five british divisions from salonika briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress princess george queen of greece in the spring of  briand urged sarrail to take the offensive in the balkans to take some of the heat off verdun although the british preoccupied with the upcoming somme offensive declined to send further troops and sarrail’s offensive that summer was not a success briand also attended the conference at saleux on  may  about the upcoming anglofrench offensive on the somme with president poincaré on whose train it was held general foch commander army group north and the british commanderinchief general haig the first secret session of the chamber of deputies was held in june  to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at verdun the government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding “effective supervision” of the army the parliamentary army commission elected abel ferry as a commissioner  august by october ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways to joffre’s fury late in  roques had been sent on a factfinding mission to salonika after britain italy and russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander sarrail to briand’s and joffre’s surprise roques returned recommending that sarrail be reinforced and that sarrail no longer report to joffre coming on the back of the disappointing results of the somme campaign and the defeat of romania roques’ report further discredited briand and joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies’ demands for a closed session in november ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower a secret session was held on  november about calling up the class of  followed by another a week later on  november briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commanderinchief in northern france with both he and sarrail reporting to the war minister although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation the closed session began on  november and lasted until  december briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government and in a speech of  november he promised to repeal joffres promotion of december  and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government briand survived a confidence vote by  six months earlier he had won a confidence vote  reconstructed governmentedit on  december briand formed a new government reducing the size of the council of ministers from  to  and replacing roques with general lyautey that day his government survived a vote of confidence by  votes and joffre was appointed generalinchief of the french armies technical adviser to the government consultative member of the war committee he was persuaded to accept by briand but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on  december with nivelle replacing him as commanderinchief of the armies of the north and northeast a senate secret session on  december attacked briands plans for a smaller war cabinet as “yet another level of bureaucracy” on  december briand pledged that he would continue to push for a “permanent allied bureau” to secure constant cooperation between the allied nations briands reduced war cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by lloyd george just appointed prime minister of britain but in practice briands often met just prior to meetings of the main cabinet painlevé declined the job of war minister as he would have preferred petain as commanderinchief rather than the inexperienced nivelle like president poincaré briand had thought petain too cautious to be suitable nivelles appointment caused great friction between the british and french high commands after lloyd george attempted to have haig placed under nivelles command at the calais conference in january briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in london – march  to resolve the matter briand resigned as prime minister on  march  as a result of disagreements over the prospective nivelle offensive to be succeeded by alexandre ribot sedit briand returned to power in  he supervised the french role in the washington naval conference of – three factors guided the french strategy and necessitated a mediterranean focus the french navy needed to carry a great many goods the mediterranean was the axis of chief interest and a supply of oil was essential the primary goal was to defend french north africa and briand made practical choices for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy the conference agreed on the american proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of  to  to  for the united states britain and japan with italy and france allocated  each frances participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human material and financial resources briands efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the germans failed in the wake of german intransigence and he was succeeded by the more bellicose raymond poincaré in the wake of the ruhr crisis however briands more conciliatory style became more acceptable and he returned to the quai dorsay in  he would remain foreign minister until his death in  during this time he was a member of  cabinets three of which he headed himself briand negotiated the briandceretti agreement with the vatican giving the french government a role in the appointment of catholic bishops kellogg–briand pactedit main article kellogg–briand pact aristide briand and gustav stresemann aristide briand received the  nobel peace prize together with gustav stresemann of germany for the locarno treaties austen chamberlain of the united kingdom had received a share of the peace prize a year earlier for the same agreement a  proposal by briand and united states secretary of state frank b kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the pact of paris aka the kellogg–briand pact the cordial relations between briand and stresemann the leading statesmen of their respective countries were cut short by the unexpected death of stresemann in  and of briand in  briand plan for european unionedit as foreign minister briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of europe described as briands locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of francogerman rapprochement it was his answer to germanys quick economic recovery and future political power briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a european union in the league of nations on  september  and in  in his memorandum on the organization of a regime of european federal union for the government of france the idea was to provide a framework to contain frances former enemy while preserving as much of the  versailles settlement as possible the briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of europe and the provision of political security to eastern europe against soviet threats the basis was economic cooperation but his fundamental concept was political for it was political power that would determine economic choices the plan under the memorandum on the organization of a system of european federal union was in the end presented as a french initiative to the league of nations with the death of his principal supporter german foreign minister gustav stresemann and the onset of the great depression in  briands plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after world war ii that eventually resulted in the european union

references  external links early lifeedit he was born in nantes loireatlantique of a petit bourgeois family he attended the nantes lycée where in  he developed a close friendship with jules verne he studied law and soon went into politics associating himself with the most advanced movements writing articles for the syndicalist journal le peuple and directing the lanterne for some time from this he passed to the petite république leaving it to found lhumanité in collaboration with jean jaurès activismedit at the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions and at the congress of working men at nantes in  he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of jules guesde from that time briand was one of the leaders of the french socialist party in  after several unsuccessful attempts he was elected deputy he declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the left in what was known as the bloc in order to check the reactionary deputies of the right from the beginning of his career in the chamber of deputies briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state he was appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the  law on separation and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders he succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied he was the principal author of the law of separation but not content with preparing it he wished to apply it as well the ministry of maurice rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property a clause of the law for which briand was not responsible consequently he accepted the portfolio of public instruction and worship in the sarrien ministry  so far as the chamber was concerned his success was complete but the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the unified socialist party march  as opposed to jaurès he contended that the socialists should cooperate actively with the radicals in all matters of reform and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals he himself was atheist he became a freemason in the lodge le trait dunion in july  while the lodge didnt record his name in spite of his repeated requests the lodge declared unworthy to him on  september  in  he joined the lodge les chevaliers du travail that was established in  prime minister of franceedit portrait of aristide briand prewaredit briand served as minister of justice under clemenceau in  before succeeding clemenceau as prime minister on  july  serving until  march  in social policy briand’s first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in april  for workers and farmers pensions that same year compulsory sickness and oldage insurance was introduced for  million rural and urban workers however a law court decision in  that questioned the legality of compulsion “enabled a large proportion of employers and workers to evade the law” briand again served as minister of justice  under the premiership of the rightwinger raymond poincaré soon to become president of the republic before again becoming prime minister for a few months from  january  until  march  first world waredit edit at the end of august  following the outbreak of the first world war briand again became minister of justice when rené viviani reconstructed his ministry in the winter of  briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to salonika in the hope of helping serbia and perhaps bringing greece romania bulgaria and italy into the war as a profrench bloc which would also act as a barrier to future russian expansion in the balkans he got on well with lloyd george who was also contrary to military advice keen for operations in the balkans and had a long talk with him on  february  briand was the main mover in persuading maurice sarrail to accept the salonika command in august  in october  following an unsuccessful french offensive and the entry of bulgaria briand again became prime minister  october  succeeding rené viviani he also became foreign minister for the first time a post held by théophile delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government he was also pledged to “unité de front” not just between the military and parliament but also closer links with the other allies a pledge met with “prolonged thunderous applause” by the deputies draft proposals for allied cooperation prepared by lord esher and maurice hankey were on the table by the time british prime minister h h asquith visited paris on  november mainly to discuss greece and only his second wartime talks with france the first had been with viviani in july  the opening weeks of briands ministry required him to broker an agreement between general gallieni the new war minister and general joffre newly  december promoted to “commanderinchief of the french armies” generalissimo over all theatres apart from north africa edit in the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the german attack at verdun  february  gallieni read an angry report at the council of ministers on  march criticising joffres conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control then resigned he was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed general roques was appointed after it had been ensured that joffre had no objections the first formal allied conference met in paris on  march  italy did not participate but initially made little impact perhaps because briand had vetoed the british suggestion of a permanent secretariat or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of anglofrench talks in the last quarter of  one of which the chantilly meeting had already seen strategy plans drawn up late in march  joffre and briand blocked the withdrawal of five british divisions from salonika briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress princess george queen of greece in the spring of  briand urged sarrail to take the offensive in the balkans to take some of the heat off verdun although the british preoccupied with the upcoming somme offensive declined to send further troops and sarrail’s offensive that summer was not a success briand also attended the conference at saleux on  may  about the upcoming anglofrench offensive on the somme with president poincaré on whose train it was held general foch commander army group north and the british commanderinchief general haig the first secret session of the chamber of deputies was held in june  to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at verdun the government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding “effective supervision” of the army the parliamentary army commission elected abel ferry as a commissioner  august by october ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways to joffre’s fury late in  roques had been sent on a factfinding mission to salonika after britain italy and russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander sarrail to briand’s and joffre’s surprise roques returned recommending that sarrail be reinforced and that sarrail no longer report to joffre coming on the back of the disappointing results of the somme campaign and the defeat of romania roques’ report further discredited briand and joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies’ demands for a closed session in november ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower a secret session was held on  november about calling up the class of  followed by another a week later on  november briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commanderinchief in northern france with both he and sarrail reporting to the war minister although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation the closed session began on  november and lasted until  december briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government and in a speech of  november he promised to repeal joffres promotion of december  and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government briand survived a confidence vote by  six months earlier he had won a confidence vote  reconstructed governmentedit on  december briand formed a new government reducing the size of the council of ministers from  to  and replacing roques with general lyautey that day his government survived a vote of confidence by  votes and joffre was appointed generalinchief of the french armies technical adviser to the government consultative member of the war committee he was persuaded to accept by briand but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on  december with nivelle replacing him as commanderinchief of the armies of the north and northeast a senate secret session on  december attacked briands plans for a smaller war cabinet as “yet another level of bureaucracy” on  december briand pledged that he would continue to push for a “permanent allied bureau” to secure constant cooperation between the allied nations briands reduced war cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by lloyd george just appointed prime minister of britain but in practice briands often met just prior to meetings of the main cabinet painlevé declined the job of war minister as he would have preferred petain as commanderinchief rather than the inexperienced nivelle like president poincaré briand had thought petain too cautious to be suitable nivelles appointment caused great friction between the british and french high commands after lloyd george attempted to have haig placed under nivelles command at the calais conference in january briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in london – march  to resolve the matter briand resigned as prime minister on  march  as a result of disagreements over the prospective nivelle offensive to be succeeded by alexandre ribot sedit briand returned to power in  he supervised the french role in the washington naval conference of – three factors guided the french strategy and necessitated a mediterranean focus the french navy needed to carry a great many goods the mediterranean was the axis of chief interest and a supply of oil was essential the primary goal was to defend french north africa and briand made practical choices for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy the conference agreed on the american proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of  to  to  for the united states britain and japan with italy and france allocated  each frances participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human material and financial resources briands efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the germans failed in the wake of german intransigence and he was succeeded by the more bellicose raymond poincaré in the wake of the ruhr crisis however briands more conciliatory style became more acceptable and he returned to the quai dorsay in  he would remain foreign minister until his death in  during this time he was a member of  cabinets three of which he headed himself briand negotiated the briandceretti agreement with the vatican giving the french government a role in the appointment of catholic bishops kellogg–briand pactedit main article kellogg–briand pact aristide briand and gustav stresemann aristide briand received the  nobel peace prize together with gustav stresemann of germany for the locarno treaties austen chamberlain of the united kingdom had received a share of the peace prize a year earlier for the same agreement a  proposal by briand and united states secretary of state frank b kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the pact of paris aka the kellogg–briand pact the cordial relations between briand and stresemann the leading statesmen of their respective countries were cut short by the unexpected death of stresemann in  and of briand in  briand plan for european unionedit as foreign minister briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of europe described as briands locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of francogerman rapprochement it was his answer to germanys quick economic recovery and future political power briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a european union in the league of nations on  september  and in  in his memorandum on the organization of a regime of european federal union for the government of france the idea was to provide a framework to contain frances former enemy while preserving as much of the  versailles settlement as possible the briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of europe and the provision of political security to eastern europe against soviet threats the basis was economic cooperation but his fundamental concept was political for it was political power that would determine economic choices the plan under the memorandum on the organization of a system of european federal union was in the end presented as a french initiative to the league of nations with the death of his principal supporter german foreign minister gustav stresemann and the onset of the great depression in  briands plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after world war ii that eventually resulted in the european union

references  external links early lifeedit he was born in nantes loireatlantique of a petit bourgeois family he attended the nantes lycée where in  he developed a close friendship with jules verne he studied law and soon went into politics associating himself with the most advanced movements writing articles for the syndicalist journal le peuple and directing the lanterne for some time from this he passed to the petite république leaving it to found lhumanité in collaboration with jean jaurès activismedit at the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions and at the congress of working men at nantes in  he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of jules guesde from that time briand was one of the leaders of the french socialist party in  after several unsuccessful attempts he was elected deputy he declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the left in what was known as the bloc in order to check the reactionary deputies of the right from the beginning of his career in the chamber of deputies briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state he was appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the  law on separation and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders he succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied he was the principal author of the law of separation but not content with preparing it he wished to apply it as well the ministry of maurice rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property a clause of the law for which briand was not responsible consequently he accepted the portfolio of public instruction and worship in the sarrien ministry  so far as the chamber was concerned his success was complete but the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the unified socialist party march  as opposed to jaurès he contended that the socialists should cooperate actively with the radicals in all matters of reform and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals he himself was atheist he became a freemason in the lodge le trait dunion in july  while the lodge didnt record his name in spite of his repeated requests the lodge declared unworthy to him on  september  in  he joined the lodge les chevaliers du travail that was established in  prime minister of franceedit portrait of aristide briand prewaredit briand served as minister of justice under clemenceau in  before succeeding clemenceau as prime minister on  july  serving until  march  in social policy briand’s first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in april  for workers and farmers pensions that same year compulsory sickness and oldage insurance was introduced for  million rural and urban workers however a law court decision in  that questioned the legality of compulsion “enabled a large proportion of employers and workers to evade the law” briand again served as minister of justice  under the premiership of the rightwinger raymond poincaré soon to become president of the republic before again becoming prime minister for a few months from  january  until  march  first world waredit edit at the end of august  following the outbreak of the first world war briand again became minister of justice when rené viviani reconstructed his ministry in the winter of  briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to salonika in the hope of helping serbia and perhaps bringing greece romania bulgaria and italy into the war as a profrench bloc which would also act as a barrier to future russian expansion in the balkans he got on well with lloyd george who was also contrary to military advice keen for operations in the balkans and had a long talk with him on  february  briand was the main mover in persuading maurice sarrail to accept the salonika command in august  in october  following an unsuccessful french offensive and the entry of bulgaria briand again became prime minister  october  succeeding rené viviani he also became foreign minister for the first time a post held by théophile delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government he was also pledged to “unité de front” not just between the military and parliament but also closer links with the other allies a pledge met with “prolonged thunderous applause” by the deputies draft proposals for allied cooperation prepared by lord esher and maurice hankey were on the table by the time british prime minister h h asquith visited paris on  november mainly to discuss greece and only his second wartime talks with france the first had been with viviani in july  the opening weeks of briands ministry required him to broker an agreement between general gallieni the new war minister and general joffre newly  december promoted to “commanderinchief of the french armies” generalissimo over all theatres apart from north africa edit in the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the german attack at verdun  february  gallieni read an angry report at the council of ministers on  march criticising joffres conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control then resigned he was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed general roques was appointed after it had been ensured that joffre had no objections the first formal allied conference met in paris on  march  italy did not participate but initially made little impact perhaps because briand had vetoed the british suggestion of a permanent secretariat or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of anglofrench talks in the last quarter of  one of which the chantilly meeting had already seen strategy plans drawn up late in march  joffre and briand blocked the withdrawal of five british divisions from salonika briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress princess george queen of greece in the spring of  briand urged sarrail to take the offensive in the balkans to take some of the heat off verdun although the british preoccupied with the upcoming somme offensive declined to send further troops and sarrail’s offensive that summer was not a success briand also attended the conference at saleux on  may  about the upcoming anglofrench offensive on the somme with president poincaré on whose train it was held general foch commander army group north and the british commanderinchief general haig the first secret session of the chamber of deputies was held in june  to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at verdun the government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding “effective supervision” of the army the parliamentary army commission elected abel ferry as a commissioner  august by october ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways to joffre’s fury late in  roques had been sent on a factfinding mission to salonika after britain italy and russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander sarrail to briand’s and joffre’s surprise roques returned recommending that sarrail be reinforced and that sarrail no longer report to joffre coming on the back of the disappointing results of the somme campaign and the defeat of romania roques’ report further discredited briand and joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies’ demands for a closed session in november ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower a secret session was held on  november about calling up the class of  followed by another a week later on  november briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commanderinchief in northern france with both he and sarrail reporting to the war minister although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation the closed session began on  november and lasted until  december briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government and in a speech of  november he promised to repeal joffres promotion of december  and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government briand survived a confidence vote by  six months earlier he had won a confidence vote  reconstructed governmentedit on  december briand formed a new government reducing the size of the council of ministers from  to  and replacing roques with general lyautey that day his government survived a vote of confidence by  votes and joffre was appointed generalinchief of the french armies technical adviser to the government consultative member of the war committee he was persuaded to accept by briand but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on  december with nivelle replacing him as commanderinchief of the armies of the north and northeast a senate secret session on  december attacked briands plans for a smaller war cabinet as “yet another level of bureaucracy” on  december briand pledged that he would continue to push for a “permanent allied bureau” to secure constant cooperation between the allied nations briands reduced war cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by lloyd george just appointed prime minister of britain but in practice briands often met just prior to meetings of the main cabinet painlevé declined the job of war minister as he would have preferred petain as commanderinchief rather than the inexperienced nivelle like president poincaré briand had thought petain too cautious to be suitable nivelles appointment caused great friction between the british and french high commands after lloyd george attempted to have haig placed under nivelles command at the calais conference in january briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in london – march  to resolve the matter briand resigned as prime minister on  march  as a result of disagreements over the prospective nivelle offensive to be succeeded by alexandre ribot sedit briand returned to power in  he supervised the french role in the washington naval conference of – three factors guided the french strategy and necessitated a mediterranean focus the french navy needed to carry a great many goods the mediterranean was the axis of chief interest and a supply of oil was essential the primary goal was to defend french north africa and briand made practical choices for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy the conference agreed on the american proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of  to  to  for the united states britain and japan with italy and france allocated  each frances participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human material and financial resources briands efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the germans failed in the wake of german intransigence and he was succeeded by the more bellicose raymond poincaré in the wake of the ruhr crisis however briands more conciliatory style became more acceptable and he returned to the quai dorsay in  he would remain foreign minister until his death in  during this time he was a member of  cabinets three of which he headed himself briand negotiated the briandceretti agreement with the vatican giving the french government a role in the appointment of catholic bishops kellogg–briand pactedit main article kellogg–briand pact aristide briand and gustav stresemann aristide briand received the  nobel peace prize together with gustav stresemann of germany for the locarno treaties austen chamberlain of the united kingdom had received a share of the peace prize a year earlier for the same agreement a  proposal by briand and united states secretary of state frank b kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the pact of paris aka the kellogg–briand pact the cordial relations between briand and stresemann the leading statesmen of their respective countries were cut short by the unexpected death of stresemann in  and of briand in  briand plan for european unionedit as foreign minister briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of europe described as briands locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of francogerman rapprochement it was his answer to germanys quick economic recovery and future political power briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a european union in the league of nations on  september  and in  in his memorandum on the organization of a regime of european federal union for the government of france the idea was to provide a framework to contain frances former enemy while preserving as much of the  versailles settlement as possible the briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of europe and the provision of political security to eastern europe against soviet threats the basis was economic cooperation but his fundamental concept was political for it was political power that would determine economic choices the plan under the memorandum on the organization of a system of european federal union was in the end presented as a french initiative to the league of nations with the death of his principal supporter german foreign minister gustav stresemann and the onset of the great depression in  briands plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after world war ii that eventually resulted in the european union
