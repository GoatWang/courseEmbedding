cogeneration inc was the owner of a cogeneration plant which caught fire in  causing the death of three employees and significant property damage plaintiff appeals from an order dismissing its suit seeking recovery for the plants repair costs expedited labor costs and lost profits from defendant automatic sprinkler corporation of america ascoa we affirm the trial courts dismissal of plaintiffs claim for repair costs but reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs lost profits and expedited labor cost claims and remand for trial on those claims  i between  and  at a cost of  plaintiff built a byfoot multistory cogeneration plant in newark which was expected to last thirty to fifty years to build this plant plaintiff hired various engineers and construction companies including ascoa and gec alsthom international inc and gec electro mechanique collectively referred to as alsthom alsthom manufactured and supplied steam turbine equipment and related piping expansion joints and other equipment for the plant ascoa was to provide a fire protection and detection system for the plant including an automatic firewater deluge system for the lube oil unit hydraulic unit and gear box for the  alsthom  steam turbinegenerator before beginning operations in november  plaintiff hired defendant john brown a professional operation company to run and maintain the plant on december   an oil fire began in the plant according to the fire investigator a rubber expansion joint in the steam turbines lube oil system which had been manufactured by alsthom separated a fine mist of heated oil sprayed into the air and then flowed onto the floor beneath a  square foot tablelike concrete pedestal that supported the steam turbine within a short time as the joint continued to break down the mist turned into a steady flow of oil which fell directly onto the floor below the pedestal this oil became combustible as it mixed with the air and subsequently ignited in a low order explosion at the joint which set the oilslicked floor on fire damaged an aluminum door and blew in the windows in the nearby control room coating everything inside with oil no sprinklers had been installed under the pedestal even though that area housed the lube oil pump and numerous supply and return lines and even though the most common hazard in a power generating plant is lube oil leakage plaintiff contended that because of the absence of sprinklers or a deluge water spray system that could discharge a high volume of water necessary to put out an oil fire the fire under the approximately thirtybytwentyfoot pedestal was not contained and progressed through the plant as the burning oil flowed away and down toward a slightly depressed corner of the plant to make matters worse five days before the fire one of the roof sprinkler heads had discharged above a gas turbine exhaust duct to prevent flooding and icing in the plant john brown employees closed the water supply valve which also eliminated the water supply to the remainder of the closed head roof sprinkler system including that portion above the steam turbine where the fire started at the opposite end of the plant repair of the sprinkler head and restoration of the water supply to the roof sprinkler system was not accomplished in the five days before the fire thus these sprinklers could not activate to contain the fire several battalions from the newark fire department were needed to get the fire under control notwithstanding their efforts three brown employees inside the plant lost their lives and the plant sustained significant damage numerous pieces of equipment beneath the steam turbine had been destroyed virtually all of the thirty miles of cabling and wiring in the plant was beyond repair much of the roof and some of its support beams needed replacement the equipment contained in the water purification station was a total loss numerous pieces of office equipment had been destroyed and everything in the plant had been coated with an oily soot residue  according to plaintiffs accountant the total cost to repair the plant was  utilizing historical data and taking into account saved operating expenses the accountant determined that plaintiff had also sustained  in lost profits during the time it took to repair the plant as part of the total repair costs plaintiff incurred  in additional labor costs for expediting the repairs which according to plaintiff were necessary to avoid breaching plaintiffs longterm power purchase agreement with its sole electric customer jersey central power  light jcp  l under this agreement jcp  l agreed to buy from plaintiff  megawatts of electricity per day over twentyfive years this agreement provided that a breach would occur if the seller fails to deliver electricity for  out of  consecutive days  for any reason other than force majeure the agreement defined force majeure as unforeseeable causes beyond the reasonable control of and without the fault or negligence of plaintiff including  fire  which by exercise of due foresight such party could not reasonably have been expected to avoid and which by the exercise of due diligence it is unable to overcome when jcp  l failed to confirm that it believed the fire to be a force majeure under the contract plaintiff expedited the repairs and succeeded in recommencing the generation of electricity in less than  days plaintiff began suit against several defendants including john brown alsthom and ascoa to recover its repair and labor costs and lost profits plaintiff settled with most defendants but proceeded to trial against alsthom and ascoa after plaintiff rested its case the trial judge dismissed plaintiffs entire complaint against ascoa because the judge concluded that plaintiff was required to apportion its damages caused by ascoas failure to provide sprinklers under the turbine pedestal the judge also ruled that the additional labor charges were unreasonably incurred and she removed from consideration by the jury plaintiffs labor cost claim against alsthom during the presentation of the defense case plaintiff settled its dispute with alsthom plaintiff then appealed from the trial courts dismissal of its suit against ascoa on appeal plaintiff argues that the trial judge erred by  dismissing the complaint against ascoa at the close of plaintiffs case for failure to apportion damages among the defendants  precluding expert testimony regarding the reasonableness of the property repairs and  excluding proofs pertaining to the labor costs incurred to expedite repairs ascoa has crossappealed claiming that while the court was correct when it precluded plaintiffs evidence attempting to establish the reasonableness of the property repairs it erred by failing to dismiss the claim for repair costs thus ascoa argues in the crossappeal that while it does not disagree with the trial courts dismissal of plaintiffs entire complaint the court alternatively could have also dismissed plaintiffs repair cost claim for failure to establish the reasonableness of its repairs technically this is not a crossappeal because a responding party is permitted to argue in opposition to the appeal any alternative basis for partial or full affirmance of the trial courts judgment see kimball intern inc v northfield metal prods  njsuper    ad  appdiv certif denied  nj   ad   nevertheless we address ascoas argument in the crossappeal as well as all of plaintiffs arguments in the main appeal within the context of the three damage claims wherein plaintiff seeks recovery of   in repair costs  in lost profits and  in expedited labor charges at the direction of the court sections ii and iii dealing with plaintiffs repair costs and lost profits are omitted from the published version of this opinion iv expedited labor costs a force majeure the trial judge struck plaintiffs claim for expedited labor costs because she concluded that a force majeure exempted plaintiff from the jcp  l contract clause which deemed a breach to exist if plaintiff fails to deliver electricity for  out of  consecutive days because plaintiff was not at fault for the fire and there was no definitive rejection of the force majeure argument by jcp  l according to the trial court there was no reasonable basis for expediting the plant repairs we must enforce nonambiguous contracts as written and not make a better contract for either party schenck v hji assocs  njsuper    ad  appdiv certif denied sub nom schenck v bailey  nj   ad   nevertheless to understand the parties intent and the nature of their agreement we must consider the surrounding circumstances and relationships of the parties at the time of the contract marchak v claridge commons inc  nj    ad   under this agreement not all fires were automatically considered force majeure events rather the agreement stated that all qualifying events had to have been unforeseeable and beyond the reasonable control of and without the fault or negligence of plaintiff in addition the parties further defined force majeure as an event which by exercise of due foresight such party could not reasonably have been expected to avoid and which by the exercise of due diligence it is unable to overcome this language does not make it easy to determine whether a particular fire would be a force majeure event in fact the contract language leads us to conclude that it was not possible to determine whether a particular fire was a force majeure until the cause of the catastrophe was established thus the parties could not have intended that the issue of force majeure be resolved immediately after the event here for example the fire inspector spent five months completing his investigation into the cause of the fire may explain why jcp  l did not respond to plaintiffs timely notification of the fire therefore a jury could have found that plaintiff aware that a determination as to the cause of the fire could take a considerable amount of time and that the plant repairs would take more than  days to complete under normal circumstances acted reasonably in expediting the repairs so as to avoid the consequences of a later default one who suffers harm by another is permitted to recover as part of its damages the reasonable cost of measures taken to prevent future injury see diamond shamrock chems co v aetna cas and sur co  njsuper    ad  appdiv restatement second of torts §  one who has already suffered injury by the tort of another is entitled to recover for expenditures reasonably made or harm suffered in a reasonable effort to avert further harm in addition plaintiff was under a legal duty to mitigate its damages mcdonald v mianecki  nj    ad   mcgraw v johnson  njsuper    ad  app div plaintiff expedited the plant repairs not only to avoid breaching its  contract with jcp  l but also to minimize its lost profits accordingly we conclude that it should have been left to the jury to decide whether plaintiff acted reasonably by continuing to expedite repairs without pressing jcp  l to declare its position regarding force majeure b apportionment of damages ascoa contended that plaintiff had an obligation to segregate those labor charges that related exclusively to expediting repair of property damaged by a particular defendants negligence according to ascoa plaintiff had to provide evidence that linked a defendants negligence with the expedited repair and the resulting enhanced labor charge the trial court agreed with ascoa that it was plaintiffs burden to apportion the damages attributable to ascoas alleged negligence the court concluded that it is the plaintiffs burden to prove each and every element of its damages and how it breaks down thus the court dismissed plaintiffs claim against ascoa despite plaintiffs proofs that the combined negligence of ascoa and other defendants clearly caused property damage to the plant  applicable apportionment law it is generally plaintiffs burden to prove not only that defendant was negligent but also that defendants negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries and damages suffered paxton v misiuk  nj    ad   apportionment of damages based on causation has long been favored by courts in this state poliseno v gen motors corp  njsuper    ad  appdiv citing campione v soden  nj    ad   certif denied  nj   ad   thus plaintiff generally must apportion or relate damages to defendants wrongful acts if proofs establish that plaintiffs injuries for example preexisted and were unconnected with defendants negligence then defendant is not responsible for the preexisting injuries ibid a defendant should be responsible only for the value of the interest he or she destroyed scafidi v seiler  nj    ad   in the normal prior or postpersonal injury aggravation claim the party in the best position to present evidence of nonaggravation or exacerbation is plaintiff plaintiffs should understand and appreciate whether and how a defendants tort may have affected their prior or post injuries or conditions the effect on plaintiff of defendants tort is uniquely within plaintiffs knowledge thus in a routine personal injury aggravation claim we do not shift the burden to defendants and to prevail plaintiffs must separate those damages caused by a particular defendants negligence from any prior or post injuries or conditions eg blanks v murphy  njsuper    ad  appdiv tisdale v fields  njsuper    ad  app div therefore the routine aggravation of personal injury or condition case represents the normal rule cited by the trial judge that plaintiffs must prove what damages a particular defendant caused paxton v misiuk supra  nj at   ad  it is important to realize that when the burden is on plaintiff to apportion damages between particular defendants and prior or subsequent injuries or conditions the result of failure to carry the burden may be dismissal of plaintiffs case so for example in hill v macomber  njsuper    ad  app div we cited an  vermont case where an owner of sheep suffered loss to  the flock by two separately owned dogs in the absence of any testimony as to which dog killed which sheep neither owner was held liable adams v hall  vt   the dismissal of such a case for failure to prove damages is difficult to accept especially when the injured plaintiff is completely innocent of any comparative negligence and defendant appears to have clearly caused some injury to plaintiff to ameliorate this potential injustice we shift the burden of apportioning injuries so as not to cause an otherwise entirely innocent plaintiff who has clearly suffered some injury at the hands of a defendant to go uncompensated eg scafidi v seiler supra  nj at   ad  fosgate v corona  nj    ad   bendar v rosen  njsuper    ad  app div lewis v preschel  njsuper    ad  appdiv hudgins v serrano  njsuper    ad  appdiv thornton v gen motors corp  njsuper    ad  law div often the burden is shifted to defendants with more expertise or better access to relevant apportionment proofs eg lanzet v greenberg  nj    ad   medical malpractice ostrowski v azzara  nj    ad   medical malpractice fosgate supra  nj at   ad  medical malpractice nopco chem div v blawknox co  nj    ad   bailment damage to commercial drying machine green v gen motors corp  njsuper    ad  appdiv products liability sholtis v am cyanamid co  njsuper    ad  appdiv asbestos exposure and hoppe v ranzini  njsuper    ad  appdiv legal malpractice besides shifting the apportionment burden to knowledgeable defendants in order to protect completely innocent plaintiffs we have also shifted this burden when innocent plaintiffs suffer a unitary harm caused by concurrent wrongs where the tortious conduct of two or more actors has combined to bring about harm to the plaintiff and one or more of the actors seeks to limit his liability on the ground that the harm is capable of apportionment among them the burden of proof as to the apportionment is upon each such actor restatement second of torts § b  see also dafler v raymark indus inc  njsuper    ad  appdiv affd  nj   ad   comdyne i inc v corbin  fd   d cir but see feldman v lederle labs  njsuper    ad  appdiv distinguishing sholtis by finding that the plaintiff in feldman suffered an incremental injury rather than a unitary or indivisible injury the reason for shifting the burden in the case of a unitary injury is to prevent the injustice of allowing a proved wrongdoer who has in fact caused harm to the plaintiff to escape liability merely because the harm which he has inflicted has combined with similar harm inflicted by other wrongdoers restatement second of torts supra § b comment d on subsection  as between the proved tortfeasor who has clearly caused some harm and the entirely innocent plaintiff any hardship due to lack of evidence as to the extent of the harm caused should fall upon the former ibid therefore when plaintiffs suffer a unitary harm at the hands of multiple defendants the defendants causing the injury are jointly and severally responsible unless the defendants can apportion the  harm goodman v fairlawn garden assocs inc  njsuper    ad  appdiv certif denied  nj   ad   daniel v state dept of transp  njsuper    ad  appdiv certif denied  nj   ad   in sholtis v am cyanamid co supra  njsuper at   ad  for example plaintiff was exposed to several asbestoscontaining products manufactured by separate defendants and it was defendants burden to minimize or eliminate its concurrent contribution to the harm at the risk of being found jointly responsible for plaintiffs condition id at   ad  once the burden is shifted the culpable defendant is responsible for all the damages unless defendant can demonstrate that the damages are capable of some reasonable apportionment and what those damages are dafler supra  njsuper at   ad  most of the cases dealing with shifting the apportionment burden involve personal rather than property injuries in borough of fort lee v banque natl de paris  njsuper    ad  appdiv  however a commercial business owners loss of income associated with a partially vacant building was aggravated by a tenant holding over after its tenancy although we found that this was not a case where the burden of apportioning damages should be shifted to defendant we recognized the potential applicability of the burden shifting doctrine in a non personal injury context id at   ad  see also nopco chem div v blawknox co supra  nj at   ad  involving property damaged during bailment  application of facts to apportionment law thus there are three factors present in the cases that shift the damage apportionment burden to defendants these factors are plaintiffs innocence more knowledgeable defendants and a unitary harm caused by concurrent misconduct contrary to ascoas argument all of these factors are present in this case and require that the apportionment burden be shifted to defendants regarding plaintiffs innocence we note that plaintiff was an offsite owner of the plant and was not present in the plant when the fire began plaintiff in fact had hired brown to manage maintain and operate the plant reasonably and safely in building the plant plaintiff had relied on third party contractors and manufacturers ostensibly with the necessary expertise to provide and install the equipment needed to operate the plant efficiently and safely plaintiff alleged and provided proofs that brown ascoa and alsthom failed in their obligations and negligently caused damage to the plant at the time plaintiffs case was dismissed there was no evidence in the record that plaintiff was anything other than an innocent victim of the concurrent torts that resulted in the plant fire in fact the trial judge in ruling on one of the other issues noted that plaintiff was innocent of any wrongdoing ascoa argues that plaintiff was more knowledgeable regarding apportionment proofs than defendants or at best plaintiff and defendants were equally situated in this case however no eye witness to this fire survived no person was able to describe from personal observation how this fire began and eventually consumed much of the plant both plaintiff and defendants had equal access to the fire investigations that were performed the defendants however had better understanding and access to the materials equipment and procedures that were employed in operating  the plant including any limitations on the equipment products and procedures while plaintiff did not segregate the various invoices by plant area or by prefire and postfire damages all of the invoices for the labor and repair charges were available to all defendants and were present in court consequently we believe that while both plaintiff and defendants were equally capable of sorting the various expenditures the defendants were better situated to interpret the fire investigations and attempt to limit the role their various materials equipment and systems may have played in this catastrophe plaintiffs proofs indicated that ascoas negligence combined with the negligence of alsthom brown and other defendants to cause fire loss throughout the plant according to ascoa however the plaintiff did not suffer a unitary harm because the absence of a sprinkler system under the concrete pedestal in no way contributed to the initial oil leak and explosion which caused some damage besides fire damage in addition the trial court seemed to believe that plaintiffs proofs merely showed that the plant would have sustained less fire damage had a deluge system been installed under the concrete pedestal where the fire started thus the court apparently concluded that the harm suffered by plaintiff was not unitary but instead was divisible there is nothing in the record to suggest that the fire simultaneously ignited away from the area which would have been protected by the omitted deluge system or that this deluge system would not have extinguished the fire completely before it had the opportunity to spread such that it can be said that there were two distinct fires here rather testimony indicated that a properly designed sprinkler system including a deluge head under the turbine pedestal would have extinguished that fire testimony also demonstrated that once the oil mist ignited at the joint the fire developed under the pedestal and then spread to other parts of the plant ascoa claimed at oral argument that besides the window and door damage there was also oil damage throughout the plant that was not its responsibility because we are reviewing a ruling by a trial judge granting a motion for judgment to defendant at the close of plaintiffs case however we must accept as true all the evidence which supports the plaintiffs position  and must accord  plaintiff the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom in determining whether a cause of action has been made out dolson v anastasia  nj    ad   we are also not concerned with the weight worth nature or extent of plaintiffs evidence only its existence id at   ad  plaintiffs proofs seemed to indicate that ascoa did not contribute to the initial oil leak and subsequent explosion which damaged the control room and an overhead aluminum door just prior to the fire these damages however were quite minimal when compared with the postfire damages that affected the entire plant with heat oily soot and smoke and required millions of dollars to repair while the prefire damages might have been separable from the postfire damages plaintiffs evidence provided no basis to conclude that the postfire damages were further divisible see rozark farms inc v ozark border elec coop  fd   th cir loss as a result of fire has traditionally been classified as a type of damage not reasonably capable of apportionment between more than one cause thus an innocent plaintiff in this case sustained unitary harm by way of fire  damage to the entire plant and because ascoa was jointly responsible with the other defendants for this damage and because it was more knowledgeable than plaintiff about its fire suppression system it bore the burden of limiting by apportionment its otherwise joint responsibility we see no reason why the apportionment burden should not be shifted in this case where all of the fire damage suffered by an apparently innocent plaintiff was caused by the concurrent negligence of multiple defendants who were responsible for plant maintenance and installation of the various equipment machines and systems that were involved in the fire the trial court should have shifted the apportionment burden rather than dismissing plaintiffs case therefore at the new trial it shall be ascoas burden to attempt apportionment of any expedited labor costs that may conceivably be related solely to the negligence of others v in conclusion we reverse the trial courts decision precluding plaintiffs claims for lost profits and expedited labor charges and direct a new trial during which plaintiff may seek recovery against ascoa for these losses we affirm the trial courts dismissal of plaintiffs claim for repair costs plaintiffs new trial shall therefore be limited to its lost profits and labor cost claims we dismiss ascoas crossappeal
