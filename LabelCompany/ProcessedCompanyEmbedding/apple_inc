premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search  apple inc product launches to look forward to in  this fool is excited about these two apple products  and the potential they have to boost apples financial results and ecosystem ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jun   at am the first half of  has been quite a busy one for apple nasdaqaapl in terms of new product launches the company has updated several of its mac personal computers released new inch and inch ipad pro models with a host of interesting new features and previewed a lot of the software goodness thats coming to apples major platforms as exciting as the first half of  has been for the mac maker i think the second half of this year should be even more exciting image source apple new iphones this year promises to be one of the biggest years for apples iphone yet the company is reportedly planning to release a highendpremium iphone commonly referred to as the iphone  which sounds like it should be quite the showstopper this new iphone is expected to come with an allnew fullface oled display which should dramatically increase image quality and deliver a substantially better user experience its also expected to come with d sensing capabilities that some believe will be critical to enabling new augmentedreality use cases of course im sure that apple will update much if not all of the internals to deliver higher performance and better device efficiency the iphone  just sounds like its going to be a cool product that has the very real potential to spark an iphone super cycle and boost the iphones average selling prices additionally apple is expected to launch two standard iphone models commonly referred to as the iphone ss plus because theyre said to be relatively straightforward upgrades to the current iphone  and iphone  plus smartphones these admittedly arent anywhere near as exciting as the new iphone  promises to be but they should bring solid new features with more affordable price points compared to what the iphone  is likely to cost and thats always a good thing the imac pro apple announced its new imac pro personal computers at wwdc but they wont be available for sale until the end of the year although the wait may certainly be frustrating for prousers looking to stick with apple the company does seem to have a compelling product with the imac pro the new imac pro systems should include extremely fast highcore count processors a powerful graphics processor a great display and other goodies for content creators developers and other potential users for whom time is equal to money having access to extremely powerful macospowered devices should be rather nice once apple begins selling these systems which i suspect will do far better in the marketplace than the mac pro has id expect a noticeable boost in the macs average selling prices  and therefore revenue all else being equal of course the imac pro isnt going to be a financially significant boost for apple though boosts to any of apples businesses should be welcomed by stockholders but itll certainly help entice pro users to stick with or perhaps even migrate to apples mac platform  a longterm positive for the platform and ultimately for apple ashraf eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends apple the motley fool has a disclosure policy

wikipedia list of products discontinued by apple inc from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search it has been suggested that this article be merged into timeline of apple inc products discuss proposed since may  the following is a list of apple inc formerly known as apple computer inc software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions or discontinued and are no longer manufactured the first apple product to be discontinued was the apple i in  superseded by the apple ii the most recently discontinued products have been several ipod models including the ipod mini replaced by the ipod nano this list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued apple product including computer systems software products peripherals ipods newtons and miscellaneous products on september   apple computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before apple removed them from their databases currently apple classifies discontinued products in three categories vintage obsolete or legacy based on the level of support they continue to provide apples current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation except only in california usa and turkey as required by statute where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued products which fall into this additional twoyear window are referred to as vintage products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered obsolete and no service of any kind is offered nor parts obtainable from apple in  apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit essentially apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain apple products purchased between  and  apple subsequently dropped this support however the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised for all legacy products while hardware service is no longer available on any of these obsolete models free technical support is offered legacy models are indicated with an asterisk  contents  apples  lisa  macintosh  original  se  lc

discontinued by apple inc from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search it has been suggested that this article be merged into timeline of apple inc products discuss proposed since may  the following is a list of apple inc formerly known as apple computer inc software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions or discontinued and are no longer manufactured the first apple product to be discontinued was the apple i in  superseded by the apple ii the most recently discontinued products have been several ipod models including the ipod mini replaced by the ipod nano this list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued apple product including computer systems software products peripherals ipods newtons and miscellaneous products on september   apple computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before apple removed them from their databases currently apple classifies discontinued products in three categories vintage obsolete or legacy based on the level of support they continue to provide apples current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation except only in california usa and turkey as required by statute where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued products which fall into this additional twoyear window are referred to as vintage products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered obsolete and no service of any kind is offered nor parts obtainable from apple in  apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit essentially apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain apple products purchased between  and  apple subsequently dropped this support however the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised for all legacy products while hardware service is no longer available on any of these obsolete models free technical support is offered legacy models are indicated with an asterisk  contents  apples  lisa  macintosh  original  se  lc  performas  imac emac  mac

may  the following is a list of apple inc formerly known as apple computer inc software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions or discontinued and are no longer manufactured

ipod nano this list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued apple product including computer systems software products peripherals ipods newtons and miscellaneous products on september   apple computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before apple removed them from their databases currently apple classifies discontinued products in three categories vintage obsolete or legacy based on the level of support they continue to provide apples current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation except only in california usa and turkey as required by statute where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued products which fall into this additional twoyear window are referred to as vintage products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered obsolete and no service of any kind is offered nor parts obtainable from apple in  apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit essentially apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain apple products purchased between  and  apple subsequently dropped this support however the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised for all legacy products while hardware service is no longer available on any of these obsolete models free technical support is offered legacy models are indicated with an asterisk  contents  apples  lisa  macintosh  original  se  lc  performas  imac emac  mac

apples largescreen iphone steals the show this year ashraf eassa tmfchipfool nov   at am apple nasdaqaapl is one of the worlds largest companies in terms of revenue and profit generation perhaps the most impressive part of the companys financial success is that it delivers those impressive results with a tight highlyfocused portfolio of products this focus pays off for the consumerelectronics giant as its products are arguably best in class thats why its sometimes a bit difficult to pick a best product among those that the company launches each year nevertheless this year its quite clear that apples iphone  plus stole the show  apple nails it with the jumbo iphone in  apple began a trend of releasing not just one but two new flagship iphone models each year  one with a inch display and one with a inch display the iphone  plus in jet black is one great device image source apple  the smaller and larger models were during the iphone  and iphone s generations differentiated by screen size screen resolution pixel density and minor camera features with the iphone  plus apple delivered a greater degree of differentiation relative to its smaller counterpart than it had in prior iphone cycles the iphone  plus incorporates a duallens camera that enables some interesting and useful features such as x optical zoom and a nifty depthoffield effect which you can see in this picture that i took image source author the result is that apples more expensive jumbosized iphone is selling better than what apple had expected going into the device launch  something that could have positive implications on iphone average selling prices and ultimately revenue should apple be able to catch up with demand in a timely fashion the iphone  plus truly represents the best of apple a wellcrafted product with unique features that entice customers to pay more because theyre genuinely getting more should apple be able to continue to deliver differentiated meaningful features with future premiumpriced iphones in coming generations apples iphone business could benefit greatly runnerup the new macbook pro computers although the internet seems to be divided on apples newly announced macbook pro updates i view these systems as quite innovative and unquestionably worthy of runnerup status here  image source apple  the new macbook pro computers include numerous internal upgrades  par for the course in the world of personal computers  along with a significantly enhanced display a reworked force touch trackpad a new keyboard design and a niftylooking touch bar apple seems to have made a genuine effort to deliver something unique to whats arguably a boring product category and for that the company should be applauded but its too soon to tell how well these new macbook pro systems will do in the marketplace apple has been losing market share in personal computers and these new systems are the companys best chance of regaining that share early indications look good the shipping times for the inch macbook pro with touch bar and new inch macbook pro are now in the four to fiveweek range  up from the two to threeweek range they started at these long

» site index the new york times apple single product company its not the iphone  apple inc nasdaqaapl  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»apple single product company its not the iphonejun  about apple inc aapl save money retire early long only longterm horizon cfasummarysomeday the iphone will be disrupted by an even better user interface we are still long apple despite this expectationservices is targeted to double in the next four years but even longer term we believe it will be more important to apple than the iphonethe services ecosystem is the single product the iphone ipad mac watch tv and homepods are accessories hardware is a means of accessing the real productwe believe apple nasdaqaapl is a single product company but that product is not the iphone someday the iphone will likely get disrupted by a new user interface probably related to augmented reality ar but we dont think this will impact apple as much as some might expect because the iphone is not the true product people are buying we see the services ecosystem functioning as the single product all the hardware including the iphone are accessories that give access to the ecosystem the ecosystem of services is much harder to disrupt it is made of so many components developers and partners it provides so much utility for so many people even if the way we access it changes the ecosystem will continue to provide an incredible experience but coming back to the current reality of ipads and iphones to access the ecosystem we see iphone demand remaining flattish over the next couple of quarters and then seeing a catchup period when the next iphone launches and we expect ipad demand to bottom in  with a fiveyear refresh cycle starting in  as the  ipad air becomes a legacy piece of hardware a single product company it has come to our attention that apple is viewed by some as a single product company we believe apple ceo tim cook sees that opinion becoming more widespread coaxing him to make comments like our services revenue topped  billion and its well on the way to being the size of a fortune  company were very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the apple ecosystem across all of our services  ceo tim cook q earnings call and demand for airpods significantly exceeds supply and growth in beats products has also been very strong in fact when we combine apple watch airpods and beats headphones our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a fortune  company  ceo tim cook q earnings call services nearly a fortune  company in the last  months services has generated revenue of  billion after eight years of growing at  cagr services include digital content and services itunes app store ibooks apple music applecare apple pay licensing and other services currently capital one financial nysecof bookends the fortune  list with  billion in revenue kraft heinz nasdaqkhc at  is close to the same revenue as apple services while notable companies not far away are facebook nasdaqfb at  and nike nysenke at  in the q earnings calls cfo luca maestri reiterated our goal is to double the size of our services business by  if apple can achieve this goal it could eclipse cocacola nyseko in revenue assuming cocacola stands still for four years  yy in  other apple hardware a fortune  company apples other products generated revenue of  billion in the last  months it has stayed in this range for a number of years as products come in and out of fashion ie ipod apple watch apple tv this includes sales of apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and applebranded and thirdparty accessories abm industries nyseabm closes out the fortune  list with  billion in revenue apples other products at  billion would be closer to the fortune  biogen nasdaqbiib at  is close to the same revenue as apples other products other notable companies nearby include estee lauder at  and toys r us at  iphone is not the single product… iphone ranks in the top  on fortune as a standalone product just ahead of amazon nasdaqamzn and iphone made up  of apples revenue in  we get it many people see iphone as the product apple will succeed by or fail because of and we dont disagree but hear us out …the ecosystem is the single product as important as the iphone is to apple the iphone is just a popular accessory arguably something will disrupt the smartphone someday people will instead use something else to access the apple ecosystem perhaps an augmented reality user interface source minority report how much time would you spend with your iphone if you had no wifi no data connectivity and no apps now think about all the great synergies you get when you have your iphone synced with your mac your ipad your apple watch your apple tv your apple carplay and soon your apple homepod all these pieces of hardware are simply accessories to connect you to the ecosystem of functionality the ecosystem is what improves your life and the ecosystem is what makes apples hardware products so great hardware is an enabler no doubt the ecosystem became what it is today because of hardware like the iphone but the focus has changed apple gives you the choice of how you want to interact with the ecosystem while we have seen people with ipads on the street taking photos the result has so far been that most people choose an iphone source extremetech since  over  billion iphones have been sold with  million or  of those sold in the last  months ipad has not fared as well since  apple has sold about  million ipads the gap in the number of units sold is interesting even despite the ipad selling at  of the price of the iphone many would say the upgrade cycle for consumers is longer but why is it longer our ipad story at home we have one ipad its an ipad air from  it has been nearly four years since we bought it we use it mostly to browse the web play candy crush were on level  but by far we watch youtube on it the most we used to use it for facetime but the quality of the camera is no longer comparable to our newer iphones so we are willing to give up size for quality we only use the ipad a couple of hours a day so the battery is more than sufficient the ipad never leaves our flat so running out of power is never an issue doing a double take of our ipad story we understand that everyone doesnt use their ipad the same way as us but one thing in common is the battery life even if you take your fouryearold ipad out with you all day you will probably come home with enough power to watch a cooking video for dinner our iphone story an iphone is a completely different story i have had two iphones in the last  years my current setup is an iphone s in space gray which i got at the end of  in the batch that had the battery issues as a result i have a new battery in my almost yearold iphone but my next refresh could be longer than average because of the battery change my first smartphone and first iphone was the iphone  which i got in late  the last six months with my iphone  i suffered with a battery that would only last half a day and shut down suddenly when it reached  on the battery bar were not telling you this because we want to give a bad review of apples products on the contrary we want to demonstrate that one of the reasons iphones are refreshed by consumers more often than ipads is because of the battery a brand new iphone or ipad connects the user into the apple ecosystem in different but very similar ways giving access to apps and files fullday usage of either product should not be an issue for new hardware but an iphones battery will see diminishing life below a usable threshold faster than an ipad this is simply due to the size and usage difference tomac did a poll with  votes on how often people upgrade their ipad over  upgrade less often than every three years with about  maybe upgrading annually source tomac we have a similar story with our mac air from  but you get the point we are still using it but we are starting to see the battery life diminish almost time for a new one after five years iphone refresh cycle less than half as long customers just want to get access to apples incredible ecosystem of apps and services they can do that with a number of products but so far they have chosen the iphone by far the iphone is strategically positioned with a smaller battery that has just enough power as a new product for a full day of heavy usage with hardware upgrades coming with a premium price and often appealing to the early adopters the majority of people will delay an upgrade until their current phone is causing them more headaches than providing value for many that means the battery is dying before they get home they are tethered to a wall all the time or attached to a power bank the beauty and coolness of an iphone are lost at this point this has meant that the iphone has had a refresh cycle of  years this compares to longer battery life products like ipad and mac which have  years or more to give with the new iphone plus versions getting bigger batteries we could see upgrade cycles on these plus versions extending a bit longer of course there are many other reasons people choose iphones like portability capability usability etc what does this mean financially first on the ecosystem apples ecosystem is a hidden asset in its services revenue line services has grown at  cagr for the last eight years and apples goal is to double the revenue between now and  which implies a  cagr through the first two quarters of  it has posted  yy growth consistently with the app store growing at  yy in q we think the apple pay cash card could add a billion dollars to the bottom line in a few years as well see our article apple bank on a topline basis apple services may never eclipse hardware products due to the difference in margin profiles but we believe in the long term apple services will mature into the largest contributor to the bottom line for apple hardware has already just become an accessory to the functionality of the services ecosystem ipad apple reached peak ipad in  this is year four since then after two quarters in  ipad sales
