donoghue v stevenson  ukhl  was a foundational decision in scots delict law and english tort law by the house of lords it created the modern concept of negligence by setting out general principles whereby one person would owe a duty of care to another person also known as the paisley snail or snail in the bottle case the facts involved mrs donoghue drinking a bottle of ginger beer in a café in paisley renfrewshire a dead snail was in the bottle she fell ill and she sued the ginger beer manufacturer mr stevenson the house of lords held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to her which was breached because it was reasonably foreseeable that failure to ensure the products safety would lead to harm of consumers prior to donoghue v stevenson liability for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly trespass to the person or indirectly trespass on the case being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either so the orthodox view was that mrs donoghue had no sustainable claim in law however the decision fundamentally created a new type of liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims this was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a faultbased system which only required injury this evolution was taken further in the later decision of letang v cooper   qb  when it was held that actions should not be jointly pleaded in trespass and negligence but in negligence

gilmour street station the station donoghue arrived at in paisley on the evening of sunday  august  during the glasgow trades holiday donoghue took a train to paisley renfrewshire in paisley she went to the wellmeadow café a friendnote  who was with her ordered a pear and ice for herself and a scotsman ice cream float a mix of ice cream and ginger beer for donoghue the owner of the café francis minghellanote  brought over a tumbler of ice cream and poured ginger beer on it from a brown and opaque bottle labelled d stevenson glen lane paisley furthermore although the bottle was labelled as stevensons mcbyde suggests it is possible it did not originally belong to him bottles were often reused and in the process occasionally returned to the incorrect manufacturer moreover stevenson initially claimed he did not issue bottles matching the description provided by donoghue– donoghue drank some of the ice cream float however when donoghues friend poured the remaining ginger beer into the tumbler a decomposed snail also floated out of the bottle donoghue claimed that she felt ill from this sight complaining of abdominal pain according to her later statements of facts condescendences she was required to consult a doctor on  august and was admitted to glasgow royal infirmary for emergency treatment on  september she was subsequently diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock the ginger beer had been manufactured by david stevenson who ran a company producing both ginger beer and lemonade at  and  glen lane paisley less than a mile away from the wellmeadow café– the contact details for the ginger beer manufacturer were on the bottle label and recorded by donoghues friend donoghue subsequently contacted and instructed walter leechman a local solicitor and city councillor whose firm had acted for the claimants in a factually similar case mullen v ag barr  co ltd less than three weeks earlier  see also george v skivington despite the ruling in mullen leechman issued a writ on donoghues behalf against stevenson on  april  the writ claimed £ in damages the same amount a claimant in mullen had recovered at first instance and £ in costs the total amount donoghue attempted to recover would be equivalent to at least £ in update condescendencesedit the full allegations made by donoghue were presented in five condescendences which claimed that stevenson had a duty of care to donoghue to ensure that snails did not get into his bottles of ginger beer but that he had breached this duty by failing to provide a system to clean bottles effectively a system that would usually be used in the business and was necessary given that the ginger beer was intended for human consumption– the ineffectiveness of the cleaning system was alleged to result from the bottles being left in places to which it was obvious that snails had freedom of access  and in which indeed snails and snail trails were frequently found an allegation described by matthew chapman as somewhat gratuitous this breach of duty was alleged to have caused donoghues subsequent illness stevenson responded to the condescendences by denying that any of his bottles of ginger beer had contained snails and that the alleged injuries are grossly exaggerated  any illness suffered by the claimant was due to the bad condition of her own health at the time– in response to the writ stevenson pleaded  that the claim had no legal basis  that the facts could not be substantiated  that he had not caused donoghue any injury and  that the claimed amount was excessive– legal backgroundedit injuries resulting from defective products were normally claimed on the basis of a contract of sale between the seller and the consumer however donoghue had no contractual relationship with minghella as she had not purchased the ginger beer while her friend did have a contract through having placed the order she had not suffered any injury moreover neither had a contract with stevenson the manufacturer donoghue was therefore required to claim damages for negligence ansell v waterhouse had established in  that legal liability could arise for an act or omission contrary to the duty which the law casts on him in the particular case ie negligence– however there was no general duty of care and therefore no general liability for negligent behaviour only limited exceptions to this rule were made in which duties were found in specific circumstances most of which had a contractual background the most difficult precedent for donoghue was mullen v ag barr  co ltd a recent court of session case in mullen two children john and francis mullen and jeanie oribine had separately found dead mice in their bottles of ginger beer manufactured by ag barr  co ltd and claimed to have become ill through drinking the tainted liquid in separate hearings in glasgow and greenock sheriff court respectively orbine was successful in claiming compensation while the mullens were not the losing parties of both cases appealed to the court of session– at the court of session the claimants argued that although there was no direct evidence that the manufacturer had been negligent in preparing the ginger beer negligence could be presumed res ipsa loquitur from the mere presence of dead mice in ginger beer bottles however the court ruled against the claimants– the majority held that on a factual basis ag barr  co ltd had rebutted a presumption of negligence and that on a legal basis product manufacturers only owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumers if there was a contractual relationship between the parties if the dangerousness of the product was intentionally withheld from the consumer in which case there might also be a claim for fraud or if there was no warning of the intrinsic dangerousness of certain products such as explosives– only lord hunter dissented finding that negligence to be inferred and that the fact that the bottle contents could not be examined because of the dark glass gave rise to a specific duty of care that would allow consumers to claim for damages– however neither of the circumstances in which negligence could be found in product liability cases applied to donoghue ginger beer is not intrinsically dangerous nor did stevenson intentionally misrepresent the threat it posed nevertheless donoghues counsel argued that manufacturers also owed a duty of care to their ultimate consumers if it was not possible to examine the goods before they were used an exception that would apply to donoghue judgmentedit court of session outer houseedit parliament house in edinburgh where the court of session sits the first interlocutory action was heard on the court of session on  may  in front of lord moncrieff after an adjournment minghella was added as a defender on  june however the claim against him was abandoned on  november likely due to his lack of contractual relationship with donoghue donoghues friend had purchased the ginger beer and his inability to examine the contents of the dark glass bottle on  december minghella and stevenson were awarded a combined costs claim of £ s d against donoghue for this abandoned strand of litigation however it was recorded on  december that donoghue did not pay the costs awarded to minghella– the case was heard by lord moncrieff in the outer house on  june  in his judgment delivered on the same day he held that as a general principle there should be liability for negligent preparation of food– i am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes ought not to be heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage in the course of the process of manufacture  tainted food when offered for sale is in my opinion amongst the most subtly potent of dangerous goods and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty i fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an act of negligence and does not advertise itself should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty or afford him a supplementary defence english case law that required that liability for injuries resulting from goods that were not intrinsically dangerous to have a contractual basis breach of warranty was dismissed by lord moncrieff citing john salmond for the narrowness of the approach and because there was no decision that incorporated it into scots law–– finally mullen despite its factual similarity was discounted by a very close reading of the precedent opinions–– court of session inner houseedit stevenson appealed the case to the inner house where it was heard by the same four judges who had found against mullen lord alness the lord justiceclerk lord ormidale lord hunter and lord anderson in their judgment given on  november  they all referred back to and supported their statements in mullen lord alness observing that the only difference — and so far as i can see it is not a material difference — between that case mullen and this case donoghue is that there we were dealing with a mouse in a gingerbeer bottle and here we are dealing with a snail in a gingerbeer bottle thus lord alness lord ormidale and lord anderson all allowed the appeal while lord hunter dissented– house of lordsedit donoghue filed a petition to appeal to the house of lords on  february  she also sought and subsequently received permission to pursue the case in forma pauperis with the status of a pauper – a status she had not for unknown reasons sought at the court of session– – providing an affidavit declaring that i am very poor and am not worth in all the world the sum of five pounds my wearing apparel and the subject matter of the said appeal only excepted this claim was supported by the minister and two elders of her church and meant that donoghue was not required to provide security for costs in case she lost the appeal her legal team had agreed to work pro bono the palace of westminster where five lords of appeal in ordinary heard donoghues appeal the petition was granted and the appeal was heard  and  december  by lord buckmaster lord atkin lord tomlin lord thankerton and lord macmillan a supplementary statement from donoghues appeal papers indicates that her counsel george morton kc and william milligan later the lord advocate and a privy counsellor argued that where anyone performs an operation such as the manufacture of an article a relationship of duty independent of contract may in certain circumstance arise the extent of such duty in every case depending on the particular circumstances of the case stevenson they argued owed a duty to take reasonable care in the manufacture of his ginger beer because the sealed bottles were opaque and therefore could not be examined and because the ginger beer was intended for human consumption–– stevensons counsel wilfrid normand kc solicitor general for scotland and later a law lord and james clyde later the lord president of the court of session and a privy counsellor responded that it is now firmly established both in english and scottish law that in the ordinary case which this is the supplier or manufacturer of an article is under no duty to anyone with whom he is not in contractual relation they denied that ginger beer was intrinsically dangerous or that stevenson knew that the product was dangerous the two established exceptions for finding a duty of care– and argued that the third exception that donoghue was attempting to introduce had no basis in precedent–– the house of lords gave judgment on  may  after an unusually long delay of over five months since the hearingnote – the court held by a majority of – that donoghues case disclosed a cause of action the majority consisted of lord atkin lord thankerton and lord macmillan lord atkin commented that he did not think a more important problem has occupied your lordships in your judicial capacity important both because of its bearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system under which it arises he agreed with counsel based on his own research that scots and english law were identical in requiring a duty of care for negligence to be found and explained his general neighbour principle on when that duty of care arises– “ at present i content myself with pointing out that in english law there must be and is some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances the liability for negligence whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of culpa is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay but acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief in this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy the rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law you must not injure your neighbour and the lawyers question who is my neighbour receives a restricted reply you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour who then in law is my neighbour the answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that i ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when i am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question ” he supported this broad test by citing heaven v pender and rejected the cases in favour of a narrower interpretation of a duty of care with the example of negligently poisoned food for which there had been no claim against the manufacturer if this were the result of the authorities i should consider the result a grave defect in the law and so contrary to principle that i should hesitate long before following any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this house– he went on to suggest that there should be a duty of care owed by all manufacturers of articles of common household use listing medicine soap and cleaning products as examples i do not think so ill of our jurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civilized society and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there is so obviously a social wrong lord atkin then rejected cases that did not support his approach and cited benjamin n cardozo in macpherson v buick motor co in favour of his view– he concluded “ if your lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action you will be affirming the proposition that by scots and english law alike a manufacturer of products which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumers life or property owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care it is a proposition which i venture to say no one in scotland or england who was not a lawyer would for one moment doubt it will be an advantage to make it clear that the law in this matter as in most others is in accordance with sound common sense i think that this appeal should be allowed ” lord thankerton ruled that donoghue had no contract with stevenson nor that her case was covered by one of the scenarios in which a duty of care had previously been found however he held that where goods could not be examined or interfered with the manufacturer had of his own accord brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer with the result that the consumer was entitled to rely upon the exercise of diligence by the manufacturer to secure that the article shall not be harmful to the consumer an exception to the general nonexistence of a duty of care that applied to donoghue– lord thankerton further argued that it was impossible to catalogue finally amid the evervarying types of human relationships those relationships in which a duty to exercise care arises apart from contract and commented that he should be sorry to think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by the seller should relieve the seller of any responsibility to the consumer without any corresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer– lord macmillan examined previous cases– and held that the law takes no cognizance of carelessness in the abstract it concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage– whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the reasonable person these circumstances must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life the categories of negligence are never closed lord macmillan held that according to this standard stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them that he owed donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink and that donoghues injury was reasonably foreseeable he therefore found that donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was happy to think that in  relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents  the principles of english and scots law are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish–– the minority consisted of lord buckmaster and lord tomlin lord buckmaster focused on precedent and commenced by warning that although common law principles are capable of application to meet new conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down these principles cannot be changed nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outside their ambit he held that there were only the two recognised exceptions to the finding of a duty of care and supported baron aldersons judgment in winterbottom v wright that the only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract if we go one step beyond that there is no reason why we should not go fifty– lord buckmaster dismissed george v skivington opining that few cases can have lived so dangerously and lived so long and rejected heaven as a tabula in naufragio latin literally plank in a shipwreck that was unrelated to donoghues case both should be buried so securely that their perturbed spirits shall no longer vex the law he concluded that there was no common law support for donoghues claim and supported lord andersons judgment in mullen– in a case like the present where the goods of the defenders are widely distributed throughout scotland it would seem little short of outrageous to make them responsible to members of the public for the condition of the contents of every bottle which issues from their works it is obvious that if such responsibility attached to the defenders they might be called on to meet claims of damages which they could not possibly investigate or insure the  versailles rail accident lord tomlin referred to in which over  people died when a train derailed the cause was a broken axle lord tomlin concurred with lord buckmaster while he agreed with lord atkin that the duty of care a manufacturer owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a sealed container made no difference to the finding of a such duty– he further endorsed concerns that lord atkins broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the versailles rail accident to be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer of the axle that broke and caused the crash the suggested ratio decidendi latin the reason for the decision of the case has varied from the narrowest jokingly suggested by julius stone that there was merely a duty not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to scots widows to the widest suggested by lord normand who had been one of stevensons counsel that lord atkins neighbour principle was the ratio– although the neighbour principle was a critical part of lord atkins reasoning and was therefore part of the ratio of his judgment neither of the other judges in the majority expressly endorsed the principle– robert heuston therefore suggests that case only supports the claims there can be duties in tort even if there is a contract that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their goods and possibly that negligence is a separate tort no amount of posthumous citation can of itself transfer with retrospective effect a proposition from the status of obiter dictum passing comments to that of ratio decidendi subsequent eventsedit the legal basis for the claim now settled the case was returned to the court of session for a hearing scheduled for january  in the hearing donoghue would have to prove the factual elements of the case that she had claimed including that there had been a snail in the ginger beer as a result of stevensons negligence and that this snail had caused her illness however stevenson died on  november  aged  one year later stevensons executors were listed as thirdparty defenders to the case however the claim was settled out of court in december  for according to leechmans son £ of the £ originally claimednote – gartloch mental hospital where donoghue died in  donoghue had moved to  maitland street with her son henry around february  he moved out when he married in  after which she moved to  jamieson street she continued to work as a shop assistant in february  donoghue divorced her husband from whom she had separated in  and who now had two sons by another woman and reverted to using her maiden name– she died of a heart attack on  march  at the age of  in gartloch mental hospital where she had probably been staying for a short period of time as a result of mental illness although she is listed on her death certificate as may mcallister she was by then commonly known as mabel hannah having adopted her mothers maiden name and the first name of her daughter who had died when she was eleven days old stevensons business was taken over by his widow mary and his son the third david stevenson in the family it became a limited company david stevenson beers and minerals limited on  july  the family sold their shares in  the glen lane manufacturing plant was demolished in the s the wellmeadow café where the snail had been found closed around  the building was demolished in  minghella its owner subsequently became a labourer he died on  march – significanceedit neighbour principleedit a stained glass window illustrating the parable of the good samaritan used to answer the lawyers question lord atkins neighbour principle that people must take reasonable care not to injure others who could foreseeably be affected by their action or inaction was a response to a question a lawyer posed to jesus it is required that someone wanting to inherit eternal life must love their neighbour as themselves but who is a persons neighbour jesus responded with the parable of the good samaritan– and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves and he the lawyer said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise the neighbour principle itself was first mentioned in relation to law by francis bullernote  in an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius which was printed in  of injuries arising from negligence or folly every man ought to take reasonable care that he does not injure his neighbour therefore wherever a man receives any hurt through the default of another though the same were not wilful yet if it be occasioned by negligence or folly the law gives him an action to recover damages for the injury so sustained in precedent there was an obiter suggestion by lord esher in heaven v pender that whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense  would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct  he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger however this approach had been rejected by the two other judges in the court of appeal– lord eshers attempt to reintroduce the principle in further obiter remarks in le lievre v gould in which he stated that heaven only established that there may be a duty even if there is no contract and that this duty arose if there was proximity between the parties was also unsuccessful– two cases from the new york court of appeals thomas v winchester and macpherson v buick motor co were also influential in the formation of the neighbour principle in thomas thomas had purchased and administered belladonna to his wife after it was mislabelled by winchester the dealer although not the seller of the treatment as extract of dandelion thomas wife became seriously ill as a consequence and thomas successfully claimed in negligence winchesters behaviour had created an imminent danger which justified a finding of a duty of care– this principle was relied on in macpherson in which a car wheel collapsed injuring macpherson the manufacturer was sued in negligence and the court held that manufacturers could owe their ultimate consumers a duty of care in limited circumstances– if the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made it is then a thing of danger its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected if to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser and used without new tests then irrespective of contract the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully  if he is negligent where danger is to be foreseen a liability will follow– lord atkin used the concept of legal neighbours in an address to the university of birminghams holdsworth club on  may  in which he commented that the man who swears unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not is a person commended by the law of morality and the law enforces that by an action for breach of contract on  october  just over one month before he heard donoghue lord atkin also used the principle in relation to defamation perjury fraud and negligence in a lecture at kings college london a man is not to injure his neighbour by acts of negligence and that certainly covers a very large field of the law i doubt whether the whole law of tort could not be comprised in the golden maxim to do unto your neighbour as you would that he should do unto younote  existence of the snailedit the existence of the paisley snail has been doubted in a speech scheduled to be delivered in may  although delayed by the second world war lord justice mackinnon jokingly suggested that it had been proven that donoghue did not find a snail in the bottle to be quite candid i detest that snail  i think that lord normand did not reveal to you that when the law had been settled by the house of lords the case went back to edinburgh to be tried on the facts and at that trial it was found that there never was a snail in the bottle at all that intruding gastropod was as much a legal fiction as the casual ejector– this allegation suggests chapman established itself as a legal myth it was repeated by lord justice jenkins in a  court of appeal practice note however both mackinnon and jenkins were unaware that the trial had not gone ahead because of stevensons death – the events following the case were only published in response to the practice note as donoghues factual claims were therefore never tested in court it is generally held that what happened in the wellmeadow café is not proven and will not be known for certain precedentedit the case was reviewed by frederick pollock in a  edition of law quarterly review in which he commented that there was no doubt as to the importance of the decision and that a notable step has been made in enlarging and clarifying our conception of a citizens duty before the law  not to turn dangerous or noxious things loose on the world however donoghue otherwise attracted little attention it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence the majority of the court of appeal lord justice cohen and lord justice asquith therefore held in candler v crane christmas  co that donoghue had not affected tortious liability for negligent misstatement this narrow understanding of donoghue changed with the cases of hedley byrne v heller in  and home office v dorset yacht co in – hedley byrne v helleredit in hedley byrne hedley byrne advertising agents had been indirectly informed by heller  partners ltd the bankers of easipower a company wishing to place a large order that easipower was a respectably constituted company considered good for its ordinary business engagements hedley byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £ when easipower went into liquidation the house of lords held that heller owed hedley byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for hedley byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a disclaimer of responsibility included in hellers letter– the application of donoghue was discussed and while all the judges agreed that it would be taking donoghue too far to immediately apply it to hedley byrne lord devlin suggested that what lord atkin did was to use his general conception the neighbour principle to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special duty and that the case could incrementally expand the duty of care–– home office v dorset yacht coedit brownsea island where some young offenders were taken in an apparent attempt to replicate brownsea island scout camp home office was the culmination of a movement from duties of care being found in specific circumstances to using the neighbour principle as a general duty of care in home office the home office had taken a group of boys from a borstal to brownsea island in poole harbour where seven had escaped overnight and collided one yacht with another belonging to dorset yacht company the company sued the home office for negligence and a preliminary issue whether the home office owed a duty of care to dorset yacht company was found in the companys favour by both the high court and the court of appeal the case was appealed to the house of lords who held by a majority that the home office did owe a duty of care– lord reid giving the leading judgment rejected the argument that there was no precedent for the claim instead acknowledging a steady trend towards regarding the law of negligence as depending on principle so that when a new point emerges one should ask not whether it is covered by authority but whether recognised principles from donoghue apply to it– donoghue he argued should therefore be applied in almost all circumstances– donoghue may be regarded as a milestone and the wellknown passage in lord atkins speech should i think be regarded as a statement of principle it is not to be treated as if it were a statutory definition it will require qualification in new circumstances but i think that the time has come when we can and should say that it ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion in the sole dissenting judgment viscount dilhorne held that the neighbour principle could not have been intended to be applied in all circumstances and that it could only be used to determine to whom a duty of care is owed rather than if one exists– judges he opined are concerned not with what the law should be but with what it is the absence of authority shows that no such duty to dorset yacht company now exists if there should be one that is in my view a matter for the legislature and not for the courts chapman comments that this conclusion appeared  distinctly quaint oldfashioned and even untenable in the light of donoghue shows how far the law had moved in the four decades which separated the two house of lords decisions caparo industries plc v dickmanedit in  the house of lords revised lord atkins neighbour principle to encompass public policy concerns articulated in caparo industries plc v dickman the threestage caparo test for establishing a duty of care requires i foreseeability of damage ii a relationship characterised by the law as one of proximity or neighbourhood and iii that the situation should be one in which the court considers it would be fair just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of given scope on one party for the benefit of the other in other jurisdictions such as new zealand there is now a twopart test for novel fact situations where the establishment of a duty must be balanced against applicable policy matters as a metaphoredit today the far reaching changes of the decision for the law of torts is sufficiently well recognised that the cases name is used as a metaphor for example barclays bank v w j simms   qb  has been described as the donoghue v stevenson of restitution for mistake it has also been stated that slades case could be said to be the donoghue v stevenson of contract similarly jarvis v swans tours ltd  ewca  has been called the donoghue v stevenson of tourism law commemorationedit the original memorial to donoghue v stevenson on the site of the former wellmeadow café in  a pilgrimage to paisley was organised by the canadian bar association the faculty of advocates and the law society of scotland this included a conference in paisley town hall entitled the pilgrimage to paisley a salute to donoghue v stevenson– a memorial commemorating the case was unveiled at the conference on the site of the former wellmeadow café and a bench was added in  both were replaced in  in  justice martin taylor produced a documentary on the case the paisley snail notesedit  scots law practice was to include both the married and maiden names of female litigants in the form maiden name or married name the maiden name for donoghue however has been listed as both mcalister and malister in the law reports even though she was born may mcallister pauper indicates that donoghue would have been unable to pay stevensons costs had she lost but was granted an exemption from providing the required security  although the friend was not named and has not been identified she is referred to as she in the house of lords judgment it has been suggested that this information was provided by counsel during the hearing  minghellas surname was incorrectly spelt as minchella in law reports of donoghue v stevenson  judgment was originally scheduled for  april but was delayed for unknown reasons although alan roger suggests that the delay gave lord macmillan time to rewrite his speech  it has also been reported that the case was settled for £ by william mcbryde on the basis of information from lord macmillan which he probably heard from lord normand one of stevensons counsel and £ by thomas donoghue may donoghues grandson however this amount is likely to be an exaggeration as it was the amount donoghue originally claimed  although authorship of an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius has also been attributed to lord bathurst  the original version of the golden maxim requires that thou shalt not

sn  case opinions manufacturers have a legal duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their products if it is not possible for defects to be identified before the goods are received court membership judges sitting lord buckmaster lord atkin lord tomlin lord thankerton lord macmillan keywords delict duty of care negligence personal injury product liability tort donoghue v stevenson  ukhl  was a foundational decision in scots delict law and english tort law by the house of lords it created the modern concept of negligence by setting out general principles whereby one person would owe a duty of care to another person also known as the paisley snail or snail in the bottle case the facts involved mrs donoghue drinking a bottle of ginger beer in a café in paisley renfrewshire a dead snail was in the bottle she fell ill and she sued the ginger beer manufacturer mr stevenson the house of lords held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to her which was breached because it was reasonably foreseeable that failure to ensure the products safety would lead to harm of consumers prior to donoghue v stevenson liability for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly trespass to the person or indirectly trespass on the case being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either so the orthodox view was that mrs donoghue had no sustainable claim in law however the decision fundamentally created a new type of liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims this was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a faultbased system which only required injury this evolution was taken further in the later decision of letang v cooper   qb  when it was held that actions should not be jointly pleaded in trespass and negligence but in negligence alone contents  facts

station donoghue arrived at in paisley on the evening of sunday  august  during the glasgow trades holiday donoghue took a train to paisley renfrewshire in paisley she went to the wellmeadow café a friendnote  who was with her ordered a pear and ice for herself and a scotsman ice cream float a mix of ice cream and ginger beer for donoghue the owner of the café francis minghellanote  brought over a tumbler of ice cream and poured ginger beer on it from a brown and opaque bottle labelled d stevenson glen lane paisley furthermore although the bottle was labelled as stevensons mcbyde suggests it is possible it did not originally belong to him bottles were often reused and in the process occasionally returned to the incorrect manufacturer moreover stevenson initially claimed he did not issue bottles matching the description provided by donoghue– donoghue drank some of the ice cream float however when donoghues friend poured the remaining ginger beer into the tumbler a decomposed snail also floated out of the bottle donoghue claimed that she felt ill from this sight complaining of abdominal pain according to her later statements of facts condescendences she was required to consult a doctor on  august and was admitted to glasgow royal infirmary for emergency treatment on  september she was subsequently diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock the ginger beer had been manufactured by david stevenson who ran a company producing both ginger beer and lemonade at  and  glen lane paisley less than a mile away from the wellmeadow café– the contact details for the ginger beer manufacturer were on the bottle label and recorded by donoghues friend donoghue subsequently contacted and instructed walter leechman a local solicitor and city councillor whose firm had acted for the claimants in a factually similar case mullen v ag barr  co ltd less than three weeks earlier  see also george v skivington despite the ruling in mullen leechman issued a writ on donoghues behalf against stevenson on  april  the writ claimed £ in damages the same amount a claimant in mullen had recovered at first instance and £ in costs the total amount donoghue attempted to recover would be equivalent to at least £ in update condescendencesedit the full allegations made by donoghue were presented in five condescendences which claimed that stevenson had a duty of care to donoghue to ensure that snails did not get into his bottles of ginger beer but that he had breached this duty by failing to provide a system to clean bottles effectively a system that would usually be used in the business and was necessary given that the ginger beer was intended for human consumption– the ineffectiveness of the cleaning system was alleged to result from the bottles being left in places to which it was obvious that snails had freedom of access  and in which indeed snails and snail trails were frequently found an allegation described by matthew chapman as somewhat gratuitous this breach of duty was alleged to have caused donoghues subsequent illness stevenson responded to the condescendences by denying that any of his bottles of ginger beer had contained snails and that the alleged injuries are grossly exaggerated  any illness suffered by the claimant was due to the bad condition of her own health at the time– in response to the writ stevenson pleaded  that the claim had no legal basis  that the facts could not be substantiated  that he had not caused donoghue any injury and  that the claimed amount was excessive– legal backgroundedit injuries resulting from defective products were normally claimed on the basis of a contract of sale between the seller and the consumer however donoghue had no contractual relationship with minghella as she had not purchased the ginger beer while her friend did have a contract through having placed the order she had not suffered any injury moreover neither had a contract with stevenson the manufacturer donoghue was therefore required to claim damages for negligence ansell v waterhouse had established in  that legal liability could arise for an act or omission contrary to the duty which the law casts on him in the particular case ie negligence– however there was no general duty of care and therefore no general liability for negligent behaviour only limited exceptions to this rule were made in which duties were found in specific circumstances most of which had a contractual background the most difficult precedent for donoghue was mullen v ag barr  co ltd a recent court of session case in mullen two children john and francis mullen and jeanie oribine had separately found dead mice in their bottles of ginger beer manufactured by ag barr  co ltd and claimed to have become ill through drinking the tainted liquid in separate hearings in glasgow and greenock sheriff court respectively orbine was successful in claiming compensation while the mullens were not the losing parties of both cases appealed to the court of session– at the court of session the claimants argued that although there was no direct evidence that the manufacturer had been negligent in preparing the ginger beer negligence could be presumed res ipsa loquitur from the mere presence of dead mice in ginger beer bottles however the court ruled against the claimants– the majority held that on a factual basis ag barr  co ltd had rebutted a presumption of negligence and that on a legal basis product manufacturers only owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumers if there was a contractual relationship between the parties if the dangerousness of the product was intentionally withheld from the consumer in which case there might also be a claim for fraud or if there was no warning of the intrinsic dangerousness of certain products such as explosives– only lord hunter dissented finding that negligence to be inferred and that the fact that the bottle contents could not be examined because of the dark glass gave rise to a specific duty of care that would allow consumers to claim for damages– however neither of the circumstances in which negligence could be found in product liability cases applied to donoghue ginger beer is not intrinsically dangerous nor did stevenson intentionally misrepresent the threat it posed nevertheless donoghues counsel argued that manufacturers also owed a duty of care to their ultimate consumers if it was not possible to examine the goods before they were used an exception that would apply to donoghue judgmentedit court of session outer houseedit parliament house in edinburgh where the court of session sits the first interlocutory action was heard on the court of session on  may  in front of lord moncrieff after an adjournment minghella was added as a defender on  june however the claim against him was abandoned on  november likely due to his lack of contractual relationship with donoghue donoghues friend had purchased the ginger beer and his inability to examine the contents of the dark glass bottle on  december minghella and stevenson were awarded a combined costs claim of £ s d against donoghue for this abandoned strand of litigation however it was recorded on  december that donoghue did not pay the costs awarded to minghella– the case was heard by lord moncrieff in the outer house on  june  in his judgment delivered on the same day he held that as a general principle there should be liability for negligent preparation of food– i am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes ought not to be heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage in the course of the process of manufacture  tainted food when offered for sale is in my opinion amongst the most subtly potent of dangerous goods and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty i fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an act of negligence and does not advertise itself should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty or afford him a supplementary defence english case law that required that liability for injuries resulting from goods that were not intrinsically dangerous to have a contractual basis breach of warranty was dismissed by lord moncrieff citing john salmond for the narrowness of the approach and because there was no decision that incorporated it into scots law–– finally mullen despite its factual similarity was discounted by a very close reading of the precedent opinions–– court of session inner houseedit stevenson appealed the case to the inner house where it was heard by the same four judges who had found against mullen lord alness the lord justiceclerk lord ormidale lord hunter and lord anderson in their judgment given on  november  they all referred back to and supported their statements in mullen lord alness observing that the only difference — and so far as i can see it is not a material difference — between that case mullen and this case donoghue is that there we were dealing with a mouse in a gingerbeer bottle and here we are dealing with a snail in a gingerbeer bottle thus lord alness lord ormidale and lord anderson all allowed the appeal while lord hunter dissented– house of lordsedit donoghue filed a petition to appeal to the house of lords on  february  she also sought and subsequently received permission to pursue the case in forma pauperis with the status of a pauper – a status she had not for unknown reasons sought at the court of session– – providing an affidavit declaring that i am very poor and am not worth in all the world the sum of five pounds my wearing apparel and the subject matter of the said appeal only excepted this claim was supported by the minister and two elders of her church and meant that donoghue was not required to provide security for costs in case she lost the appeal her legal team had agreed to work pro bono the palace of westminster where five lords of appeal in ordinary heard donoghues appeal the petition was granted and the appeal was heard  and  december  by lord buckmaster lord atkin lord tomlin lord thankerton and lord macmillan a supplementary statement from donoghues appeal papers indicates that her counsel george morton kc and william milligan later the lord advocate and a privy counsellor argued that where anyone performs an operation such as the manufacture of an article a relationship of duty independent of contract may in certain circumstance arise the extent of such duty in every case depending on the particular circumstances of the case stevenson they argued owed a duty to take reasonable care in the manufacture of his ginger beer because the sealed bottles were opaque and therefore could not be examined and because the ginger beer was intended for human consumption–– stevensons counsel wilfrid normand kc solicitor general for scotland and later a law lord and james clyde later the lord president of the court of session and a privy counsellor responded that it is now firmly established both in english and scottish law that in the ordinary case which this is the supplier or manufacturer of an article is under no duty to anyone with whom he is not in contractual relation they denied that ginger beer was intrinsically dangerous or that stevenson knew that the product was dangerous the two established exceptions for finding a duty of care– and argued that the third exception that donoghue was attempting to introduce had no basis in precedent–– the house of lords gave judgment on  may  after an unusually long delay of over five months since the hearingnote – the court held by a majority of – that donoghues case disclosed a cause of action the majority consisted of lord atkin lord thankerton and lord macmillan lord atkin commented that he did not think a more important problem has occupied your lordships in your judicial capacity important both because of its bearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system under which it arises he agreed with counsel based on his own research that scots and english law were identical in requiring a duty of care for negligence to be found and explained his general neighbour principle on when that duty of care arises– “ at present i content myself with pointing out that in english law there must be and is some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances the liability for negligence whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of culpa is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay but acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief in this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy the rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law you must not injure your neighbour and the lawyers question who is my neighbour receives a restricted reply you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour who then in law is my neighbour the answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that i ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when i am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question ” he supported this broad test by citing heaven v pender and rejected the cases in favour of a narrower interpretation of a duty of care with the example of negligently poisoned food for which there had been no claim against the manufacturer if this were the result of the authorities i should consider the result a grave defect in the law and so contrary to principle that i should hesitate long before following any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this house– he went on to suggest that there should be a duty of care owed by all manufacturers of articles of common household use listing medicine soap and cleaning products as examples i do not think so ill of our jurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civilized society and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there is so obviously a social wrong lord atkin then rejected cases that did not support his approach and cited benjamin n cardozo in macpherson v buick motor co in favour of his view– he concluded “ if your lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action you will be affirming the proposition that by scots and english law alike a manufacturer of products which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumers life or property owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care it is a proposition which i venture to say no one in scotland or england who was not a lawyer would for one moment doubt it will be an advantage to make it clear that the law in this matter as in most others is in accordance with sound common sense i think that this appeal should be allowed ” lord thankerton ruled that donoghue had no contract with stevenson nor that her case was covered by one of the scenarios in which a duty of care had previously been found however he held that where goods could not be examined or interfered with the manufacturer had of his own accord brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer with the result that the consumer was entitled to rely upon the exercise of diligence by the manufacturer to secure that the article shall not be harmful to the consumer an exception to the general nonexistence of a duty of care that applied to donoghue– lord thankerton further argued that it was impossible to catalogue finally amid the evervarying types of human relationships those relationships in which a duty to exercise care arises apart from contract and commented that he should be sorry to think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by the seller should relieve the seller of any responsibility to the consumer without any corresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer– lord macmillan examined previous cases– and held that the law takes no cognizance of carelessness in the abstract it concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage– whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the reasonable person these circumstances must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life the categories of negligence are never closed lord macmillan held that according to this standard stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them that he owed donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink and that donoghues injury was reasonably foreseeable he therefore found that donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was happy to think that in  relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents  the principles of english and scots law are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish–– the minority consisted of lord buckmaster and lord tomlin lord buckmaster focused on precedent and commenced by warning that although common law principles are capable of application to meet new conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down these principles cannot be changed nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outside their ambit he held that there were only the two recognised exceptions to the finding of a duty of care and supported baron aldersons judgment in winterbottom v wright that the only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract if we go one step beyond that there is no reason why we should not go fifty– lord buckmaster dismissed george v skivington opining that few cases can have lived so dangerously and lived so long and rejected heaven as a tabula in naufragio latin literally plank in a shipwreck that was unrelated to donoghues case both should be buried so securely that their perturbed spirits shall no longer vex the law he concluded that there was no common law support for donoghues claim and supported lord andersons judgment in mullen– in a case like the present where the goods of the defenders are widely distributed throughout scotland it would seem little short of outrageous to make them responsible to members of the public for the condition of the contents of every bottle which issues from their works it is obvious that if such responsibility attached to the defenders they might be called on to meet claims of damages which they could not possibly investigate or insure the  versailles rail accident lord tomlin referred to in which over  people died when a train derailed the cause was a broken axle lord tomlin concurred with lord buckmaster while he agreed with lord atkin that the duty of care a manufacturer owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a sealed container made no difference to the finding of a such duty– he further endorsed concerns that lord atkins broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the versailles rail accident to be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer of the axle that broke and caused the crash the suggested ratio decidendi latin the reason for the decision of the case has varied from the narrowest jokingly suggested by julius stone that there was merely a duty not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to scots widows to the widest suggested by lord normand who had been one of stevensons counsel that lord atkins neighbour principle was the ratio– although the neighbour principle was a critical part of lord atkins reasoning and was therefore part of the ratio of his judgment neither of the other judges in the majority expressly endorsed the principle– robert heuston therefore suggests that case only supports the claims there can be duties in tort even if there is a contract that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their goods and possibly that negligence is a separate tort no amount of posthumous citation can of itself transfer with retrospective effect a proposition from the status of obiter dictum passing comments to that of ratio decidendi subsequent eventsedit the legal basis for the claim now settled the case was returned to the court of session for a hearing scheduled for january  in the hearing donoghue would have to prove the factual elements of the case that she had claimed including that there had been a snail in the ginger beer as a result of stevensons negligence and that this snail had caused her illness however stevenson died on  november  aged  one year later stevensons executors were listed as thirdparty defenders to the case however the claim was settled out of court in december  for according to leechmans son £ of the £ originally claimednote – gartloch mental hospital where donoghue died in  donoghue had moved to  maitland street with her son henry around february  he moved out when he married in  after which she moved to  jamieson street she continued to work as a shop assistant in february  donoghue divorced her husband from whom she had separated in  and who now had two sons by another woman and reverted to using her maiden name– she died of a heart attack on  march  at the age of  in gartloch mental hospital where she had probably been staying for a short period of time as a result of mental illness although she is listed on her death certificate as may mcallister she was by then commonly known as mabel hannah having adopted her mothers maiden name and the first name of her daughter who had died when she was eleven days old stevensons business was taken over by his widow mary and his son the third david stevenson in the family it became a limited company david stevenson beers and minerals limited on  july  the family sold their shares in  the glen lane manufacturing plant was demolished in the s the wellmeadow café where the snail had been found closed around  the building was demolished in  minghella its owner subsequently became a labourer he died on  march – significanceedit neighbour principleedit a stained glass window illustrating the parable of the good samaritan used to answer the lawyers question lord atkins neighbour principle that people must take reasonable care not to injure others who could foreseeably be affected by their action or inaction was a response to a question a lawyer posed to jesus it is required that someone wanting to inherit eternal life must love their neighbour as themselves but who is a persons neighbour jesus responded with the parable of the good samaritan– and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves and he the lawyer said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise the neighbour principle itself was first mentioned in relation to law by francis bullernote  in an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius which was printed in  of injuries arising from negligence or folly every man ought to take reasonable care that he does not injure his neighbour therefore wherever a man receives any hurt through the default of another though the same were not wilful yet if it be occasioned by negligence or folly the law gives him an action to recover damages for the injury so sustained in precedent there was an obiter suggestion by lord esher in heaven v pender that whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense  would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct  he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger however this approach had been rejected by the two other judges in the court of appeal– lord eshers attempt to reintroduce the principle in further obiter remarks in le lievre v gould in which he stated that heaven only established that there may be a duty even if there is no contract and that this duty arose if there was proximity between the parties was also unsuccessful– two cases from the new york court of appeals thomas v winchester and macpherson v buick motor co were also influential in the formation of the neighbour principle in thomas thomas had purchased and administered belladonna to his wife after it was mislabelled by winchester the dealer although not the seller of the treatment as extract of dandelion thomas wife became seriously ill as a consequence and thomas successfully claimed in negligence winchesters behaviour had created an imminent danger which justified a finding of a duty of care– this principle was relied on in macpherson in which a car wheel collapsed injuring macpherson the manufacturer was sued in negligence and the court held that manufacturers could owe their ultimate consumers a duty of care in limited circumstances– if the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made it is then a thing of danger its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected if to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser and used without new tests then irrespective of contract the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully  if he is negligent where danger is to be foreseen a liability will follow– lord atkin used the concept of legal neighbours in an address to the university of birminghams holdsworth club on  may  in which he commented that the man who swears unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not is a person commended by the law of morality and the law enforces that by an action for breach of contract on  october  just over one month before he heard donoghue lord atkin also used the principle in relation to defamation perjury fraud and negligence in a lecture at kings college london a man is not to injure his neighbour by acts of negligence and that certainly covers a very large field of the law i doubt whether the whole law of tort could not be comprised in the golden maxim to do unto your neighbour as you would that he should do unto younote  existence of the snailedit the existence of the paisley snail has been doubted in a speech scheduled to be delivered in may  although delayed by the second world war lord justice mackinnon jokingly suggested that it had been proven that donoghue did not find a snail in the bottle to be quite candid i detest that snail  i think that lord normand did not reveal to you that when the law had been settled by the house of lords the case went back to edinburgh to be tried on the facts and at that trial it was found that there never was a snail in the bottle at all that intruding gastropod was as much a legal fiction as the casual ejector– this allegation suggests chapman established itself as a legal myth it was repeated by lord justice jenkins in a  court of appeal practice note however both mackinnon and jenkins were unaware that the trial had not gone ahead because of stevensons death – the events following the case were only published in response to the practice note as donoghues factual claims were therefore never tested in court it is generally held that what happened in the wellmeadow café is not proven and will not be known for certain precedentedit the case was reviewed by frederick pollock in a  edition of law quarterly review in which he commented that there was no doubt as to the importance of the decision and that a notable step has been made in enlarging and clarifying our conception of a citizens duty before the law  not to turn dangerous or noxious things loose on the world however donoghue otherwise attracted little attention it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence the majority of the court of appeal lord justice cohen and lord justice asquith therefore held in candler v crane christmas  co that donoghue had not affected tortious liability for negligent misstatement this narrow understanding of donoghue changed with the cases of hedley byrne v heller in  and home office v dorset yacht co in – hedley byrne v helleredit in hedley byrne hedley byrne advertising agents had been indirectly informed by heller  partners ltd the bankers of easipower a company wishing to place a large order that easipower was a respectably constituted company considered good for its ordinary business engagements hedley byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £ when easipower went into liquidation the house of lords held that heller owed hedley byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for hedley byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a disclaimer of responsibility included in hellers letter– the application of donoghue was discussed and while all the judges agreed that it would be taking donoghue too far to immediately apply it to hedley byrne lord devlin suggested that what lord atkin did was to use his general conception the neighbour principle to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special duty and that the case could incrementally expand the duty of care–– home office v dorset yacht coedit brownsea island where some young offenders were taken in an apparent attempt to replicate brownsea island scout camp home office was the culmination of a movement from duties of care being found in specific circumstances to using the neighbour principle as a general duty of care in home office the home office had taken a group of boys from a borstal to brownsea island in poole harbour where seven had escaped overnight and collided one yacht with another belonging to dorset yacht company the company sued the home office for negligence and a preliminary issue whether the home office owed a duty of care to dorset yacht company was found in the companys favour by both the high court and the court of appeal the case was appealed to the house of lords who held by a majority that the home office did owe a duty of care– lord reid giving the leading judgment rejected the argument that there was no precedent for the claim instead acknowledging a steady trend towards regarding the law of negligence as depending on principle so that when a new point emerges one should ask not whether it is covered by authority but whether recognised principles from donoghue apply to it– donoghue he argued should therefore be applied in almost all circumstances– donoghue may be regarded as a milestone and the wellknown passage in lord atkins speech should i think be regarded as a statement of principle it is not to be treated as if it were a statutory definition it will require qualification in new circumstances but i think that the time has come when we can and should say that it ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion in the sole dissenting judgment viscount dilhorne held that the neighbour principle could not have been intended to be applied in all circumstances and that it could only be used to determine to whom a duty of care is owed rather than if one exists– judges he opined are concerned not with what the law should be but with what it is the absence of authority shows that no such duty to dorset yacht company now exists if there should be one that is in my view a matter for the legislature and not for the courts chapman comments that this conclusion appeared  distinctly quaint oldfashioned and even untenable in the light of donoghue shows how far the law had moved in the four decades which separated the two house of lords decisions caparo industries plc v dickmanedit in  the house of lords revised lord atkins neighbour principle to encompass public policy concerns articulated in caparo industries plc v dickman the threestage caparo test for establishing a duty of care requires i foreseeability of damage ii a relationship characterised by the law as one of proximity or neighbourhood and iii that the situation should be one in which the court considers it would be fair just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of given scope on one party for the benefit of the other in other jurisdictions such as new zealand there is now a twopart test for novel fact situations where the establishment of a duty must be balanced against applicable policy matters as a metaphoredit today the far reaching changes of the decision for the law of torts is sufficiently well recognised that the cases name is used as a metaphor for example barclays bank v w j simms   qb  has been described as the donoghue v stevenson of restitution for mistake it has also been stated that slades case could be said to be the donoghue v stevenson of contract similarly jarvis v swans tours ltd  ewca  has been called the donoghue v stevenson of tourism law commemorationedit the original memorial to donoghue v stevenson on the site of the former wellmeadow café in  a pilgrimage to paisley was organised by the canadian bar association the faculty of advocates and the law society of scotland this included a conference in paisley town hall entitled the pilgrimage to paisley a salute to donoghue v stevenson– a memorial commemorating the case was unveiled at the conference on the site of the former wellmeadow café and a bench was added in  both were replaced in  in  justice martin taylor produced a documentary on the case the paisley snail notesedit  scots law practice was to include both the married and maiden names of female litigants in the form maiden name or married name the maiden name for donoghue however has been listed as both mcalister and malister in the law reports even though she was born may mcallister pauper indicates that donoghue would have been unable to pay stevensons costs had she lost but was granted an exemption from providing the required security  although the friend was not named and has not been identified she is referred to as she in the house of lords judgment it has been suggested that this information was provided by counsel during the hearing  minghellas surname was incorrectly spelt as minchella in law reports of donoghue v stevenson  judgment was originally scheduled for  april but was delayed for unknown reasons although alan roger suggests that the delay gave lord macmillan time to rewrite his speech  it has also been reported that the case was settled for £ by william mcbryde on the basis of information from lord macmillan which he probably heard from lord normand one of stevensons counsel and £ by thomas donoghue may donoghues grandson however this amount is likely to be an exaggeration as it was the amount donoghue originally claimed  although authorship of an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius has also been attributed to lord bathurst  the original version of the golden maxim requires that thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people

identified before the goods are received court membership judges sitting lord buckmaster lord atkin lord tomlin lord thankerton lord macmillan keywords delict duty of care negligence personal injury product liability tort donoghue v stevenson  ukhl  was a foundational decision in scots delict law and english tort law by the house of lords it created the modern concept of negligence by setting out general principles whereby one person would owe a duty of care to another person also known as the paisley snail or snail in the bottle case the facts involved mrs donoghue drinking a bottle of ginger beer in a café in paisley renfrewshire a dead snail was in the bottle she fell ill and she sued the ginger beer manufacturer mr stevenson the house of lords held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to her which was breached because it was reasonably foreseeable that failure to ensure the products safety would lead to harm of consumers prior to donoghue v stevenson liability for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly trespass to the person or indirectly trespass on the case being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either so the orthodox view was that mrs donoghue had no sustainable claim in law however the decision fundamentally created a new type of liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims this was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a faultbased system which only required injury this evolution was taken further in the later decision of letang v cooper   qb  when it was held that actions should not be jointly pleaded in trespass and negligence

links factsedit gilmour street station the station donoghue arrived at in paisley on the evening of sunday  august  during the glasgow trades holiday donoghue took a train to paisley renfrewshire in paisley she went to the wellmeadow café a friendnote  who was with her ordered a pear and ice for herself and a scotsman ice cream float a mix of ice cream and ginger beer for donoghue the owner of the café francis minghellanote  brought over a tumbler of ice cream and poured ginger beer on it from a brown and opaque bottle labelled d stevenson glen lane paisley furthermore although the bottle was labelled as stevensons mcbyde suggests it is possible it did not originally belong to him bottles were often reused and in the process occasionally returned to the incorrect manufacturer moreover stevenson initially claimed he did not issue bottles matching the description provided by donoghue– donoghue drank some of the ice cream float however when donoghues friend poured the remaining ginger beer into the tumbler a decomposed snail also floated out of the bottle donoghue claimed that she felt ill from this sight complaining of abdominal pain according to her later statements of facts condescendences she was required to consult a doctor on  august and was admitted to glasgow royal infirmary for emergency treatment on  september she was subsequently diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock the ginger beer had been manufactured by david stevenson who ran a company producing both ginger beer and lemonade at  and  glen lane paisley less than a mile away from the wellmeadow café– the contact details for the ginger beer manufacturer were on the bottle label and recorded by donoghues friend donoghue subsequently contacted and instructed walter leechman a local solicitor and city councillor whose firm had acted for the claimants in a factually similar case mullen v ag barr  co ltd less than three weeks earlier  see also george v skivington despite the ruling in mullen leechman issued a writ on donoghues behalf against stevenson on  april  the writ claimed £ in damages the same amount a claimant in mullen had recovered at first instance and £ in costs the total amount donoghue attempted to recover would be equivalent to at least £ in update condescendencesedit the full allegations made by donoghue were presented in five condescendences which claimed that stevenson had a duty of care to donoghue to ensure that snails did not get into his bottles of ginger beer but that he had breached this duty by failing to provide a system to clean bottles effectively a system that would usually be used in the business and was necessary given that the ginger beer was intended for human consumption– the ineffectiveness of the cleaning system was alleged to result from the bottles being left in places to which it was obvious that snails had freedom of access  and in which indeed snails and snail trails were frequently found an allegation described by matthew chapman as somewhat gratuitous this breach of duty was alleged to have caused donoghues subsequent illness stevenson responded to the condescendences by denying that any of his bottles of ginger beer had contained snails and that the alleged injuries are grossly exaggerated  any illness suffered by the claimant was due to the bad condition of her own health at the time– in response to the writ stevenson pleaded  that the claim had no legal basis  that the facts could not be substantiated  that he had not caused donoghue any injury and  that the claimed amount was excessive– legal backgroundedit injuries resulting from defective products were normally claimed on the basis of a contract of sale between the seller and the consumer however donoghue had no contractual relationship with minghella as she had not purchased the ginger beer while her friend did have a contract through having placed the order she had not suffered any injury moreover neither had a contract with stevenson the manufacturer donoghue was therefore required to claim damages for negligence ansell v waterhouse had established in  that legal liability could arise for an act or omission contrary to the duty which the law casts on him in the particular case ie negligence– however there was no general duty of care and therefore no general liability for negligent behaviour only limited exceptions to this rule were made in which duties were found in specific circumstances most of which had a contractual background the most difficult precedent for donoghue was mullen v ag barr  co ltd a recent court of session case in mullen two children john and francis mullen and jeanie oribine had separately found dead mice in their bottles of ginger beer manufactured by ag barr  co ltd and claimed to have become ill through drinking the tainted liquid in separate hearings in glasgow and greenock sheriff court respectively orbine was successful in claiming compensation while the mullens were not the losing parties of both cases appealed to the court of session– at the court of session the claimants argued that although there was no direct evidence that the manufacturer had been negligent in preparing the ginger beer negligence could be presumed res ipsa loquitur from the mere presence of dead mice in ginger beer bottles however the court ruled against the claimants– the majority held that on a factual basis ag barr  co ltd had rebutted a presumption of negligence and that on a legal basis product manufacturers only owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumers if there was a contractual relationship between the parties if the dangerousness of the product was intentionally withheld from the consumer in which case there might also be a claim for fraud or if there was no warning of the intrinsic dangerousness of certain products such as explosives– only lord hunter dissented finding that negligence to be inferred and that the fact that the bottle contents could not be examined because of the dark glass gave rise to a specific duty of care that would allow consumers to claim for damages– however neither of the circumstances in which negligence could be found in product liability cases applied to donoghue ginger beer is not intrinsically dangerous nor did stevenson intentionally misrepresent the threat it posed nevertheless donoghues counsel argued that manufacturers also owed a duty of care to their ultimate consumers if it was not possible to examine the goods before they were used an exception that would apply to donoghue judgmentedit court of session outer houseedit parliament house in edinburgh where the court of session sits the first interlocutory action was heard on the court of session on  may  in front of lord moncrieff after an adjournment minghella was added as a defender on  june however the claim against him was abandoned on  november likely due to his lack of contractual relationship with donoghue donoghues friend had purchased the ginger beer and his inability to examine the contents of the dark glass bottle on  december minghella and stevenson were awarded a combined costs claim of £ s d against donoghue for this abandoned strand of litigation however it was recorded on  december that donoghue did not pay the costs awarded to minghella– the case was heard by lord moncrieff in the outer house on  june  in his judgment delivered on the same day he held that as a general principle there should be liability for negligent preparation of food– i am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes ought not to be heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage in the course of the process of manufacture  tainted food when offered for sale is in my opinion amongst the most subtly potent of dangerous goods and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty i fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an act of negligence and does not advertise itself should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty or afford him a supplementary defence english case law that required that liability for injuries resulting from goods that were not intrinsically dangerous to have a contractual basis breach of warranty was dismissed by lord moncrieff citing john salmond for the narrowness of the approach and because there was no decision that incorporated it into scots law–– finally mullen despite its factual similarity was discounted by a very close reading of the precedent opinions–– court of session inner houseedit stevenson appealed the case to the inner house where it was heard by the same four judges who had found against mullen lord alness the lord justiceclerk lord ormidale lord hunter and lord anderson in their judgment given on  november  they all referred back to and supported their statements in mullen lord alness observing that the only difference — and so far as i can see it is not a material difference — between that case mullen and this case donoghue is that there we were dealing with a mouse in a gingerbeer bottle and here we are dealing with a snail in a gingerbeer bottle thus lord alness lord ormidale and lord anderson all allowed the appeal while lord hunter dissented– house of lordsedit donoghue filed a petition to appeal to the house of lords on  february  she also sought and subsequently received permission to pursue the case in forma pauperis with the status of a pauper – a status she had not for unknown reasons sought at the court of session– – providing an affidavit declaring that i am very poor and am not worth in all the world the sum of five pounds my wearing apparel and the subject matter of the said appeal only excepted this claim was supported by the minister and two elders of her church and meant that donoghue was not required to provide security for costs in case she lost the appeal her legal team had agreed to work pro bono the palace of westminster where five lords of appeal in ordinary heard donoghues appeal the petition was granted and the appeal was heard  and  december  by lord buckmaster lord atkin lord tomlin lord thankerton and lord macmillan a supplementary statement from donoghues appeal papers indicates that her counsel george morton kc and william milligan later the lord advocate and a privy counsellor argued that where anyone performs an operation such as the manufacture of an article a relationship of duty independent of contract may in certain circumstance arise the extent of such duty in every case depending on the particular circumstances of the case stevenson they argued owed a duty to take reasonable care in the manufacture of his ginger beer because the sealed bottles were opaque and therefore could not be examined and because the ginger beer was intended for human consumption–– stevensons counsel wilfrid normand kc solicitor general for scotland and later a law lord and james clyde later the lord president of the court of session and a privy counsellor responded that it is now firmly established both in english and scottish law that in the ordinary case which this is the supplier or manufacturer of an article is under no duty to anyone with whom he is not in contractual relation they denied that ginger beer was intrinsically dangerous or that stevenson knew that the product was dangerous the two established exceptions for finding a duty of care– and argued that the third exception that donoghue was attempting to introduce had no basis in precedent–– the house of lords gave judgment on  may  after an unusually long delay of over five months since the hearingnote – the court held by a majority of – that donoghues case disclosed a cause of action the majority consisted of lord atkin lord thankerton and lord macmillan lord atkin commented that he did not think a more important problem has occupied your lordships in your judicial capacity important both because of its bearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system under which it arises he agreed with counsel based on his own research that scots and english law were identical in requiring a duty of care for negligence to be found and explained his general neighbour principle on when that duty of care arises– “ at present i content myself with pointing out that in english law there must be and is some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances the liability for negligence whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of culpa is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay but acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief in this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy the rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law you must not injure your neighbour and the lawyers question who is my neighbour receives a restricted reply you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour who then in law is my neighbour the answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that i ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when i am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question ” he supported this broad test by citing heaven v pender and rejected the cases in favour of a narrower interpretation of a duty of care with the example of negligently poisoned food for which there had been no claim against the manufacturer if this were the result of the authorities i should consider the result a grave defect in the law and so contrary to principle that i should hesitate long before following any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this house– he went on to suggest that there should be a duty of care owed by all manufacturers of articles of common household use listing medicine soap and cleaning products as examples i do not think so ill of our jurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civilized society and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there is so obviously a social wrong lord atkin then rejected cases that did not support his approach and cited benjamin n cardozo in macpherson v buick motor co in favour of his view– he concluded “ if your lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action you will be affirming the proposition that by scots and english law alike a manufacturer of products which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumers life or property owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care it is a proposition which i venture to say no one in scotland or england who was not a lawyer would for one moment doubt it will be an advantage to make it clear that the law in this matter as in most others is in accordance with sound common sense i think that this appeal should be allowed ” lord thankerton ruled that donoghue had no contract with stevenson nor that her case was covered by one of the scenarios in which a duty of care had previously been found however he held that where goods could not be examined or interfered with the manufacturer had of his own accord brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer with the result that the consumer was entitled to rely upon the exercise of diligence by the manufacturer to secure that the article shall not be harmful to the consumer an exception to the general nonexistence of a duty of care that applied to donoghue– lord thankerton further argued that it was impossible to catalogue finally amid the evervarying types of human relationships those relationships in which a duty to exercise care arises apart from contract and commented that he should be sorry to think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by the seller should relieve the seller of any responsibility to the consumer without any corresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer– lord macmillan examined previous cases– and held that the law takes no cognizance of carelessness in the abstract it concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage– whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the reasonable person these circumstances must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life the categories of negligence are never closed lord macmillan held that according to this standard stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them that he owed donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink and that donoghues injury was reasonably foreseeable he therefore found that donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was happy to think that in  relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents  the principles of english and scots law are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish–– the minority consisted of lord buckmaster and lord tomlin lord buckmaster focused on precedent and commenced by warning that although common law principles are capable of application to meet new conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down these principles cannot be changed nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outside their ambit he held that there were only the two recognised exceptions to the finding of a duty of care and supported baron aldersons judgment in winterbottom v wright that the only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract if we go one step beyond that there is no reason why we should not go fifty– lord buckmaster dismissed george v skivington opining that few cases can have lived so dangerously and lived so long and rejected heaven as a tabula in naufragio latin literally plank in a shipwreck that was unrelated to donoghues case both should be buried so securely that their perturbed spirits shall no longer vex the law he concluded that there was no common law support for donoghues claim and supported lord andersons judgment in mullen– in a case like the present where the goods of the defenders are widely distributed throughout scotland it would seem little short of outrageous to make them responsible to members of the public for the condition of the contents of every bottle which issues from their works it is obvious that if such responsibility attached to the defenders they might be called on to meet claims of damages which they could not possibly investigate or insure the  versailles rail accident lord tomlin referred to in which over  people died when a train derailed the cause was a broken axle lord tomlin concurred with lord buckmaster while he agreed with lord atkin that the duty of care a manufacturer owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a sealed container made no difference to the finding of a such duty– he further endorsed concerns that lord atkins broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the versailles rail accident to be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer of the axle that broke and caused the crash the suggested ratio decidendi latin the reason for the decision of the case has varied from the narrowest jokingly suggested by julius stone that there was merely a duty not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to scots widows to the widest suggested by lord normand who had been one of stevensons counsel that lord atkins neighbour principle was the ratio– although the neighbour principle was a critical part of lord atkins reasoning and was therefore part of the ratio of his judgment neither of the other judges in the majority expressly endorsed the principle– robert heuston therefore suggests that case only supports the claims there can be duties in tort even if there is a contract that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their goods and possibly that negligence is a separate tort no amount of posthumous citation can of itself transfer with retrospective effect a proposition from the status of obiter dictum passing comments to that of ratio decidendi subsequent eventsedit the legal basis for the claim now settled the case was returned to the court of session for a hearing scheduled for january  in the hearing donoghue would have to prove the factual elements of the case that she had claimed including that there had been a snail in the ginger beer as a result of stevensons negligence and that this snail had caused her illness however stevenson died on  november  aged  one year later stevensons executors were listed as thirdparty defenders to the case however the claim was settled out of court in december  for according to leechmans son £ of the £ originally claimednote – gartloch mental hospital where donoghue died in  donoghue had moved to  maitland street with her son henry around february  he moved out when he married in  after which she moved to  jamieson street she continued to work as a shop assistant in february  donoghue divorced her husband from whom she had separated in  and who now had two sons by another woman and reverted to using her maiden name– she died of a heart attack on  march  at the age of  in gartloch mental hospital where she had probably been staying for a short period of time as a result of mental illness although she is listed on her death certificate as may mcallister she was by then commonly known as mabel hannah having adopted her mothers maiden name and the first name of her daughter who had died when she was eleven days old stevensons business was taken over by his widow mary and his son the third david stevenson in the family it became a limited company david stevenson beers and minerals limited on  july  the family sold their shares in  the glen lane manufacturing plant was demolished in the s the wellmeadow café where the snail had been found closed around  the building was demolished in  minghella its owner subsequently became a labourer he died on  march – significanceedit neighbour principleedit a stained glass window illustrating the parable of the good samaritan used to answer the lawyers question lord atkins neighbour principle that people must take reasonable care not to injure others who could foreseeably be affected by their action or inaction was a response to a question a lawyer posed to jesus it is required that someone wanting to inherit eternal life must love their neighbour as themselves but who is a persons neighbour jesus responded with the parable of the good samaritan– and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves and he the lawyer said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise the neighbour principle itself was first mentioned in relation to law by francis bullernote  in an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius which was printed in  of injuries arising from negligence or folly every man ought to take reasonable care that he does not injure his neighbour therefore wherever a man receives any hurt through the default of another though the same were not wilful yet if it be occasioned by negligence or folly the law gives him an action to recover damages for the injury so sustained in precedent there was an obiter suggestion by lord esher in heaven v pender that whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense  would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct  he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger however this approach had been rejected by the two other judges in the court of appeal– lord eshers attempt to reintroduce the principle in further obiter remarks in le lievre v gould in which he stated that heaven only established that there may be a duty even if there is no contract and that this duty arose if there was proximity between the parties was also unsuccessful– two cases from the new york court of appeals thomas v winchester and macpherson v buick motor co were also influential in the formation of the neighbour principle in thomas thomas had purchased and administered belladonna to his wife after it was mislabelled by winchester the dealer although not the seller of the treatment as extract of dandelion thomas wife became seriously ill as a consequence and thomas successfully claimed in negligence winchesters behaviour had created an imminent danger which justified a finding of a duty of care– this principle was relied on in macpherson in which a car wheel collapsed injuring macpherson the manufacturer was sued in negligence and the court held that manufacturers could owe their ultimate consumers a duty of care in limited circumstances– if the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made it is then a thing of danger its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected if to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser and used without new tests then irrespective of contract the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully  if he is negligent where danger is to be foreseen a liability will follow– lord atkin used the concept of legal neighbours in an address to the university of birminghams holdsworth club on  may  in which he commented that the man who swears unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not is a person commended by the law of morality and the law enforces that by an action for breach of contract on  october  just over one month before he heard donoghue lord atkin also used the principle in relation to defamation perjury fraud and negligence in a lecture at kings college london a man is not to injure his neighbour by acts of negligence and that certainly covers a very large field of the law i doubt whether the whole law of tort could not be comprised in the golden maxim to do unto your neighbour as you would that he should do unto younote  existence of the snailedit the existence of the paisley snail has been doubted in a speech scheduled to be delivered in may  although delayed by the second world war lord justice mackinnon jokingly suggested that it had been proven that donoghue did not find a snail in the bottle to be quite candid i detest that snail  i think that lord normand did not reveal to you that when the law had been settled by the house of lords the case went back to edinburgh to be tried on the facts and at that trial it was found that there never was a snail in the bottle at all that intruding gastropod was as much a legal fiction as the casual ejector– this allegation suggests chapman established itself as a legal myth it was repeated by lord justice jenkins in a  court of appeal practice note however both mackinnon and jenkins were unaware that the trial had not gone ahead because of stevensons death – the events following the case were only published in response to the practice note as donoghues factual claims were therefore never tested in court it is generally held that what happened in the wellmeadow café is not proven and will not be known for certain precedentedit the case was reviewed by frederick pollock in a  edition of law quarterly review in which he commented that there was no doubt as to the importance of the decision and that a notable step has been made in enlarging and clarifying our conception of a citizens duty before the law  not to turn dangerous or noxious things loose on the world however donoghue otherwise attracted little attention it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence the majority of the court of appeal lord justice cohen and lord justice asquith therefore held in candler v crane christmas  co that donoghue had not affected tortious liability for negligent misstatement this narrow understanding of donoghue changed with the cases of hedley byrne v heller in  and home office v dorset yacht co in – hedley byrne v helleredit in hedley byrne hedley byrne advertising agents had been indirectly informed by heller  partners ltd the bankers of easipower a company wishing to place a large order that easipower was a respectably constituted company considered good for its ordinary business engagements hedley byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £ when easipower went into liquidation the house of lords held that heller owed hedley byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for hedley byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a disclaimer of responsibility included in hellers letter– the application of donoghue was discussed and while all the judges agreed that it would be taking donoghue too far to immediately apply it to hedley byrne lord devlin suggested that what lord atkin did was to use his general conception the neighbour principle to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special duty and that the case could incrementally expand the duty of care–– home office v dorset yacht coedit brownsea island where some young offenders were taken in an apparent attempt to replicate brownsea island scout camp home office was the culmination of a movement from duties of care being found in specific circumstances to using the neighbour principle as a general duty of care in home office the home office had taken a group of boys from a borstal to brownsea island in poole harbour where seven had escaped overnight and collided one yacht with another belonging to dorset yacht company the company sued the home office for negligence and a preliminary issue whether the home office owed a duty of care to dorset yacht company was found in the companys favour by both the high court and the court of appeal the case was appealed to the house of lords who held by a majority that the home office did owe a duty of care– lord reid giving the leading judgment rejected the argument that there was no precedent for the claim instead acknowledging a steady trend towards regarding the law of negligence as depending on principle so that when a new point emerges one should ask not whether it is covered by authority but whether recognised principles from donoghue apply to it– donoghue he argued should therefore be applied in almost all circumstances– donoghue may be regarded as a milestone and the wellknown passage in lord atkins speech should i think be regarded as a statement of principle it is not to be treated as if it were a statutory definition it will require qualification in new circumstances but i think that the time has come when we can and should say that it ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion in the sole dissenting judgment viscount dilhorne held that the neighbour principle could not have been intended to be applied in all circumstances and that it could only be used to determine to whom a duty of care is owed rather than if one exists– judges he opined are concerned not with what the law should be but with what it is the absence of authority shows that no such duty to dorset yacht company now exists if there should be one that is in my view a matter for the legislature and not for the courts chapman comments that this conclusion appeared  distinctly quaint oldfashioned and even untenable in the light of donoghue shows how far the law had moved in the four decades which separated the two house of lords decisions caparo industries plc v dickmanedit in  the house of lords revised lord atkins neighbour principle to encompass public policy concerns articulated in caparo industries plc v dickman the threestage caparo test for establishing a duty of care requires i foreseeability of damage ii a relationship characterised by the law as one of proximity or neighbourhood and iii that the situation should be one in which the court considers it would be fair just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of given scope on one party for the benefit of the other in other jurisdictions such as new zealand there is now a twopart test for novel fact situations where the establishment of a duty must be balanced against applicable policy matters as a metaphoredit today the far reaching changes of the decision for the law of torts is sufficiently well recognised that the cases name is used as a metaphor for example barclays bank v w j simms   qb  has been described as the donoghue v stevenson of restitution for mistake it has also been stated that slades case could be said to be the donoghue v stevenson of contract similarly jarvis v swans tours ltd  ewca  has been called the donoghue v stevenson of tourism law commemorationedit the original memorial to donoghue v stevenson on the site of the former wellmeadow café in  a pilgrimage to paisley was organised by the canadian bar association the faculty of advocates and the law society of scotland this included a conference in paisley town hall entitled the pilgrimage to paisley a salute to donoghue v stevenson– a memorial commemorating the case was unveiled at the conference on the site of the former wellmeadow café and a bench was added in  both were replaced in  in  justice martin taylor produced a documentary on the case the paisley snail notesedit  scots law practice was to include both the married and maiden names of female litigants in the form maiden name or married name the maiden name for donoghue however has been listed as both mcalister and malister in the law reports even though she was born may mcallister pauper indicates that donoghue would have been unable to pay stevensons costs had she lost but was granted an exemption from providing the required security  although the friend was not named and has not been identified she is referred to as she in the house of lords judgment it has been suggested that this information was provided by counsel during the hearing  minghellas surname was incorrectly spelt as minchella in law reports of donoghue v stevenson  judgment was originally scheduled for  april but was delayed for unknown reasons although alan roger suggests that the delay gave lord macmillan time to rewrite his speech  it has also been reported that the case was settled for £ by william mcbryde on the basis of information from lord macmillan which he probably heard from lord normand one of stevensons counsel and £ by thomas donoghue may donoghues grandson however this amount is likely to be an exaggeration as it was the amount donoghue originally claimed  although authorship of an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius has also been attributed to lord bathurst  the original version of the golden maxim requires that thou shalt not

thankerton lord macmillan keywords delict duty of care negligence personal injury product liability tort donoghue v stevenson  ukhl  was a foundational decision in scots delict law and english tort law by the house of lords it created the modern concept of negligence by setting out general principles whereby one person would owe a duty of care to another person also known as the paisley snail or snail in the bottle case the facts involved mrs donoghue drinking a bottle of ginger beer in a café in paisley renfrewshire a dead snail was in the bottle she fell ill and she sued the ginger beer manufacturer mr stevenson the house of lords held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to her which was breached because it was reasonably foreseeable that failure to ensure the products safety would lead to harm of consumers prior to donoghue v stevenson liability for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly trespass to the person or indirectly trespass on the case being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either so the orthodox view was that mrs donoghue had no sustainable claim in law however the decision fundamentally created a new type of liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims this was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a faultbased system which only required injury this evolution was taken further in the later decision of letang v cooper

august  during the glasgow trades holiday donoghue took a train to paisley renfrewshire in paisley she went to the wellmeadow café a friendnote  who was with her ordered a pear and ice for herself and a scotsman ice cream float a mix of ice cream and ginger beer for donoghue the owner of the café francis minghellanote  brought over a tumbler of ice cream and poured ginger beer on it from a brown and opaque bottle labelled d stevenson glen lane paisley furthermore although the bottle was labelled as stevensons mcbyde suggests it is possible it did not originally belong to him bottles were often reused and in the process occasionally returned to the incorrect manufacturer moreover stevenson initially claimed he did not issue bottles matching the description provided by donoghue– donoghue drank some of the ice cream float however when donoghues friend poured the remaining ginger beer into the tumbler a decomposed snail also floated out of the bottle donoghue claimed that she felt ill from this sight complaining of abdominal pain according to her later statements of facts condescendences she was required to consult a doctor on  august and was admitted to glasgow royal infirmary for emergency treatment on  september she was subsequently diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock the ginger beer had been manufactured by david stevenson who ran a company producing both ginger beer and lemonade at  and  glen lane paisley less than a mile away from the wellmeadow café– the contact details for the ginger beer manufacturer were on the bottle label and recorded by donoghues friend donoghue subsequently contacted and instructed walter leechman a local solicitor and city councillor whose firm had acted for the claimants in a factually similar case mullen v ag barr  co ltd less than three weeks earlier  see also george v skivington despite the ruling in mullen leechman issued a writ on donoghues behalf against stevenson on  april  the writ claimed £ in damages the same amount a claimant in mullen had recovered at first instance and £ in costs the total amount donoghue attempted to recover would be equivalent to at least £ in update condescendencesedit the full allegations made by donoghue were presented in five condescendences which claimed that stevenson had a duty of care to donoghue to ensure that snails did not get into his bottles of ginger beer but that he had breached this duty by failing to provide a system to clean bottles effectively a system that would usually be used in the business and was necessary given that the ginger beer was intended for human consumption– the ineffectiveness of the cleaning system was alleged to result from the bottles being left in places to which it was obvious that snails had freedom of access  and in which indeed snails and snail trails were frequently found an allegation described by matthew chapman as somewhat gratuitous this breach of duty was alleged to have caused donoghues subsequent illness stevenson responded to the condescendences by denying that any of his bottles of ginger beer had contained snails and that the alleged injuries are grossly exaggerated  any illness suffered by the claimant was due to the bad condition of her own health at the time– in response to the writ stevenson pleaded  that the claim had no legal basis  that the facts could not be substantiated  that he had not caused donoghue any injury and  that the claimed amount was excessive– legal backgroundedit injuries resulting from defective products were normally claimed on the basis of a contract of sale between the seller and the consumer however donoghue had no contractual relationship with minghella as she had not purchased the ginger beer while her friend did have a contract through having placed the order she had not suffered any injury moreover neither had a contract with stevenson the manufacturer donoghue was therefore required to claim damages for negligence ansell v waterhouse had established in  that legal liability could arise for an act or omission contrary to the duty which the law casts on him in the particular case ie negligence– however there was no general duty of care and therefore no general liability for negligent behaviour only limited exceptions to this rule were made in which duties were found in specific circumstances most of which had a contractual background the most difficult precedent for donoghue was mullen v ag barr  co ltd a recent court of session case in mullen two children john and francis mullen and jeanie oribine had separately found dead mice in their bottles of ginger beer manufactured by ag barr  co ltd and claimed to have become ill through drinking the tainted liquid in separate hearings in glasgow and greenock sheriff court respectively orbine was successful in claiming compensation while the mullens were not the losing parties of both cases appealed to the court of session– at the court of session the claimants argued that although there was no direct evidence that the manufacturer had been negligent in preparing the ginger beer negligence could be presumed res ipsa loquitur from the mere presence of dead mice in ginger beer bottles however the court ruled against the claimants– the majority held that on a factual basis ag barr  co ltd had rebutted a presumption of negligence and that on a legal basis product manufacturers only owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumers if there was a contractual relationship between the parties if the dangerousness of the product was intentionally withheld from the consumer in which case there might also be a claim for fraud or if there was no warning of the intrinsic dangerousness of certain products such as explosives– only lord hunter dissented finding that negligence to be inferred and that the fact that the bottle contents could not be examined because of the dark glass gave rise to a specific duty of care that would allow consumers to claim for damages– however neither of the circumstances in which negligence could be found in product liability cases applied to donoghue ginger beer is not intrinsically dangerous nor did stevenson intentionally misrepresent the threat it posed nevertheless donoghues counsel argued that manufacturers also owed a duty of care to their ultimate consumers if it was not possible to examine the goods before they were used an exception that would apply to donoghue judgmentedit court of session outer houseedit parliament house in edinburgh where the court of session sits the first interlocutory action was heard on the court of session on  may  in front of lord moncrieff after an adjournment minghella was added as a defender on  june however the claim against him was abandoned on  november likely due to his lack of contractual relationship with donoghue donoghues friend had purchased the ginger beer and his inability to examine the contents of the dark glass bottle on  december minghella and stevenson were awarded a combined costs claim of £ s d against donoghue for this abandoned strand of litigation however it was recorded on  december that donoghue did not pay the costs awarded to minghella– the case was heard by lord moncrieff in the outer house on  june  in his judgment delivered on the same day he held that as a general principle there should be liability for negligent preparation of food– i am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes ought not to be heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage in the course of the process of manufacture  tainted food when offered for sale is in my opinion amongst the most subtly potent of dangerous goods and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty i fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an act of negligence and does not advertise itself should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty or afford him a supplementary defence english case law that required that liability for injuries resulting from goods that were not intrinsically dangerous to have a contractual basis breach of warranty was dismissed by lord moncrieff citing john salmond for the narrowness of the approach and because there was no decision that incorporated it into scots law–– finally mullen despite its factual similarity was discounted by a very close reading of the precedent opinions–– court of session inner houseedit stevenson appealed the case to the inner house where it was heard by the same four judges who had found against mullen lord alness the lord justiceclerk lord ormidale lord hunter and lord anderson in their judgment given on  november  they all referred back to and supported their statements in mullen lord alness observing that the only difference — and so far as i can see it is not a material difference — between that case mullen and this case donoghue is that there we were dealing with a mouse in a gingerbeer bottle and here we are dealing with a snail in a gingerbeer bottle thus lord alness lord ormidale and lord anderson all allowed the appeal while lord hunter dissented– house of lordsedit donoghue filed a petition to appeal to the house of lords on  february  she also sought and subsequently received permission to pursue the case in forma pauperis with the status of a pauper – a status she had not for unknown reasons sought at the court of session– – providing an affidavit declaring that i am very poor and am not worth in all the world the sum of five pounds my wearing apparel and the subject matter of the said appeal only excepted this claim was supported by the minister and two elders of her church and meant that donoghue was not required to provide security for costs in case she lost the appeal her legal team had agreed to work pro bono the palace of westminster where five lords of appeal in ordinary heard donoghues appeal the petition was granted and the appeal was heard  and  december  by lord buckmaster lord atkin lord tomlin lord thankerton and lord macmillan a supplementary statement from donoghues appeal papers indicates that her counsel george morton kc and william milligan later the lord advocate and a privy counsellor argued that where anyone performs an operation such as the manufacture of an article a relationship of duty independent of contract may in certain circumstance arise the extent of such duty in every case depending on the particular circumstances of the case stevenson they argued owed a duty to take reasonable care in the manufacture of his ginger beer because the sealed bottles were opaque and therefore could not be examined and because the ginger beer was intended for human consumption–– stevensons counsel wilfrid normand kc solicitor general for scotland and later a law lord and james clyde later the lord president of the court of session and a privy counsellor responded that it is now firmly established both in english and scottish law that in the ordinary case which this is the supplier or manufacturer of an article is under no duty to anyone with whom he is not in contractual relation they denied that ginger beer was intrinsically dangerous or that stevenson knew that the product was dangerous the two established exceptions for finding a duty of care– and argued that the third exception that donoghue was attempting to introduce had no basis in precedent–– the house of lords gave judgment on  may  after an unusually long delay of over five months since the hearingnote – the court held by a majority of – that donoghues case disclosed a cause of action the majority consisted of lord atkin lord thankerton and lord macmillan lord atkin commented that he did not think a more important problem has occupied your lordships in your judicial capacity important both because of its bearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system under which it arises he agreed with counsel based on his own research that scots and english law were identical in requiring a duty of care for negligence to be found and explained his general neighbour principle on when that duty of care arises– “ at present i content myself with pointing out that in english law there must be and is some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances the liability for negligence whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of culpa is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay but acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief in this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy the rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law you must not injure your neighbour and the lawyers question who is my neighbour receives a restricted reply you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour who then in law is my neighbour the answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that i ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when i am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question ” he supported this broad test by citing heaven v pender and rejected the cases in favour of a narrower interpretation of a duty of care with the example of negligently poisoned food for which there had been no claim against the manufacturer if this were the result of the authorities i should consider the result a grave defect in the law and so contrary to principle that i should hesitate long before following any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this house– he went on to suggest that there should be a duty of care owed by all manufacturers of articles of common household use listing medicine soap and cleaning products as examples i do not think so ill of our jurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civilized society and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there is so obviously a social wrong lord atkin then rejected cases that did not support his approach and cited benjamin n cardozo in macpherson v buick motor co in favour of his view– he concluded “ if your lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action you will be affirming the proposition that by scots and english law alike a manufacturer of products which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumers life or property owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care it is a proposition which i venture to say no one in scotland or england who was not a lawyer would for one moment doubt it will be an advantage to make it clear that the law in this matter as in most others is in accordance with sound common sense i think that this appeal should be allowed ” lord thankerton ruled that donoghue had no contract with stevenson nor that her case was covered by one of the scenarios in which a duty of care had previously been found however he held that where goods could not be examined or interfered with the manufacturer had of his own accord brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer with the result that the consumer was entitled to rely upon the exercise of diligence by the manufacturer to secure that the article shall not be harmful to the consumer an exception to the general nonexistence of a duty of care that applied to donoghue– lord thankerton further argued that it was impossible to catalogue finally amid the evervarying types of human relationships those relationships in which a duty to exercise care arises apart from contract and commented that he should be sorry to think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by the seller should relieve the seller of any responsibility to the consumer without any corresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer– lord macmillan examined previous cases– and held that the law takes no cognizance of carelessness in the abstract it concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage– whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the reasonable person these circumstances must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life the categories of negligence are never closed lord macmillan held that according to this standard stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them that he owed donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink and that donoghues injury was reasonably foreseeable he therefore found that donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was happy to think that in  relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents  the principles of english and scots law are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish–– the minority consisted of lord buckmaster and lord tomlin lord buckmaster focused on precedent and commenced by warning that although common law principles are capable of application to meet new conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down these principles cannot be changed nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outside their ambit he held that there were only the two recognised exceptions to the finding of a duty of care and supported baron aldersons judgment in winterbottom v wright that the only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract if we go one step beyond that there is no reason why we should not go fifty– lord buckmaster dismissed george v skivington opining that few cases can have lived so dangerously and lived so long and rejected heaven as a tabula in naufragio latin literally plank in a shipwreck that was unrelated to donoghues case both should be buried so securely that their perturbed spirits shall no longer vex the law he concluded that there was no common law support for donoghues claim and supported lord andersons judgment in mullen– in a case like the present where the goods of the defenders are widely distributed throughout scotland it would seem little short of outrageous to make them responsible to members of the public for the condition of the contents of every bottle which issues from their works it is obvious that if such responsibility attached to the defenders they might be called on to meet claims of damages which they could not possibly investigate or insure the  versailles rail accident lord tomlin referred to in which over  people died when a train derailed the cause was a broken axle lord tomlin concurred with lord buckmaster while he agreed with lord atkin that the duty of care a manufacturer owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a sealed container made no difference to the finding of a such duty– he further endorsed concerns that lord atkins broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the versailles rail accident to be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer of the axle that broke and caused the crash the suggested ratio decidendi latin the reason for the decision of the case has varied from the narrowest jokingly suggested by julius stone that there was merely a duty not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to scots widows to the widest suggested by lord normand who had been one of stevensons counsel that lord atkins neighbour principle was the ratio– although the neighbour principle was a critical part of lord atkins reasoning and was therefore part of the ratio of his judgment neither of the other judges in the majority expressly endorsed the principle– robert heuston therefore suggests that case only supports the claims there can be duties in tort even if there is a contract that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their goods and possibly that negligence is a separate tort no amount of posthumous citation can of itself transfer with retrospective effect a proposition from the status of obiter dictum passing comments to that of ratio decidendi subsequent eventsedit the legal basis for the claim now settled the case was returned to the court of session for a hearing scheduled for january  in the hearing donoghue would have to prove the factual elements of the case that she had claimed including that there had been a snail in the ginger beer as a result of stevensons negligence and that this snail had caused her illness however stevenson died on  november  aged  one year later stevensons executors were listed as thirdparty defenders to the case however the claim was settled out of court in december  for according to leechmans son £ of the £ originally claimednote – gartloch mental hospital where donoghue died in  donoghue had moved to  maitland street with her son henry around february  he moved out when he married in  after which she moved to  jamieson street she continued to work as a shop assistant in february  donoghue divorced her husband from whom she had separated in  and who now had two sons by another woman and reverted to using her maiden name– she died of a heart attack on  march  at the age of  in gartloch mental hospital where she had probably been staying for a short period of time as a result of mental illness although she is listed on her death certificate as may mcallister she was by then commonly known as mabel hannah having adopted her mothers maiden name and the first name of her daughter who had died when she was eleven days old stevensons business was taken over by his widow mary and his son the third david stevenson in the family it became a limited company david stevenson beers and minerals limited on  july  the family sold their shares in  the glen lane manufacturing plant was demolished in the s the wellmeadow café where the snail had been found closed around  the building was demolished in  minghella its owner subsequently became a labourer he died on  march – significanceedit neighbour principleedit a stained glass window illustrating the parable of the good samaritan used to answer the lawyers question lord atkins neighbour principle that people must take reasonable care not to injure others who could foreseeably be affected by their action or inaction was a response to a question a lawyer posed to jesus it is required that someone wanting to inherit eternal life must love their neighbour as themselves but who is a persons neighbour jesus responded with the parable of the good samaritan– and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves and he the lawyer said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise the neighbour principle itself was first mentioned in relation to law by francis bullernote  in an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius which was printed in  of injuries arising from negligence or folly every man ought to take reasonable care that he does not injure his neighbour therefore wherever a man receives any hurt through the default of another though the same were not wilful yet if it be occasioned by negligence or folly the law gives him an action to recover damages for the injury so sustained in precedent there was an obiter suggestion by lord esher in heaven v pender that whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense  would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct  he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger however this approach had been rejected by the two other judges in the court of appeal– lord eshers attempt to reintroduce the principle in further obiter remarks in le lievre v gould in which he stated that heaven only established that there may be a duty even if there is no contract and that this duty arose if there was proximity between the parties was also unsuccessful– two cases from the new york court of appeals thomas v winchester and macpherson v buick motor co were also influential in the formation of the neighbour principle in thomas thomas had purchased and administered belladonna to his wife after it was mislabelled by winchester the dealer although not the seller of the treatment as extract of dandelion thomas wife became seriously ill as a consequence and thomas successfully claimed in negligence winchesters behaviour had created an imminent danger which justified a finding of a duty of care– this principle was relied on in macpherson in which a car wheel collapsed injuring macpherson the manufacturer was sued in negligence and the court held that manufacturers could owe their ultimate consumers a duty of care in limited circumstances– if the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made it is then a thing of danger its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected if to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser and used without new tests then irrespective of contract the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully  if he is negligent where danger is to be foreseen a liability will follow– lord atkin used the concept of legal neighbours in an address to the university of birminghams holdsworth club on  may  in which he commented that the man who swears unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not is a person commended by the law of morality and the law enforces that by an action for breach of contract on  october  just over one month before he heard donoghue lord atkin also used the principle in relation to defamation perjury fraud and negligence in a lecture at kings college london a man is not to injure his neighbour by acts of negligence and that certainly covers a very large field of the law i doubt whether the whole law of tort could not be comprised in the golden maxim to do unto your neighbour as you would that he should do unto younote  existence of the snailedit the existence of the paisley snail has been doubted in a speech scheduled to be delivered in may  although delayed by the second world war lord justice mackinnon jokingly suggested that it had been proven that donoghue did not find a snail in the bottle to be quite candid i detest that snail  i think that lord normand did not reveal to you that when the law had been settled by the house of lords the case went back to edinburgh to be tried on the facts and at that trial it was found that there never was a snail in the bottle at all that intruding gastropod was as much a legal fiction as the casual ejector– this allegation suggests chapman established itself as a legal myth it was repeated by lord justice jenkins in a  court of appeal practice note however both mackinnon and jenkins were unaware that the trial had not gone ahead because of stevensons death – the events following the case were only published in response to the practice note as donoghues factual claims were therefore never tested in court it is generally held that what happened in the wellmeadow café is not proven and will not be known for certain precedentedit the case was reviewed by frederick pollock in a  edition of law quarterly review in which he commented that there was no doubt as to the importance of the decision and that a notable step has been made in enlarging and clarifying our conception of a citizens duty before the law  not to turn dangerous or noxious things loose on the world however donoghue otherwise attracted little attention it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence the majority of the court of appeal lord justice cohen and lord justice asquith therefore held in candler v crane christmas  co that donoghue had not affected tortious liability for negligent misstatement this narrow understanding of donoghue changed with the cases of hedley byrne v heller in  and home office v dorset yacht co in – hedley byrne v helleredit in hedley byrne hedley byrne advertising agents had been indirectly informed by heller  partners ltd the bankers of easipower a company wishing to place a large order that easipower was a respectably constituted company considered good for its ordinary business engagements hedley byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £ when easipower went into liquidation the house of lords held that heller owed hedley byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for hedley byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a disclaimer of responsibility included in hellers letter– the application of donoghue was discussed and while all the judges agreed that it would be taking donoghue too far to immediately apply it to hedley byrne lord devlin suggested that what lord atkin did was to use his general conception the neighbour principle to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special duty and that the case could incrementally expand the duty of care–– home office v dorset yacht coedit brownsea island where some young offenders were taken in an apparent attempt to replicate brownsea island scout camp home office was the culmination of a movement from duties of care being found in specific circumstances to using the neighbour principle as a general duty of care in home office the home office had taken a group of boys from a borstal to brownsea island in poole harbour where seven had escaped overnight and collided one yacht with another belonging to dorset yacht company the company sued the home office for negligence and a preliminary issue whether the home office owed a duty of care to dorset yacht company was found in the companys favour by both the high court and the court of appeal the case was appealed to the house of lords who held by a majority that the home office did owe a duty of care– lord reid giving the leading judgment rejected the argument that there was no precedent for the claim instead acknowledging a steady trend towards regarding the law of negligence as depending on principle so that when a new point emerges one should ask not whether it is covered by authority but whether recognised principles from donoghue apply to it– donoghue he argued should therefore be applied in almost all circumstances– donoghue may be regarded as a milestone and the wellknown passage in lord atkins speech should i think be regarded as a statement of principle it is not to be treated as if it were a statutory definition it will require qualification in new circumstances but i think that the time has come when we can and should say that it ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion in the sole dissenting judgment viscount dilhorne held that the neighbour principle could not have been intended to be applied in all circumstances and that it could only be used to determine to whom a duty of care is owed rather than if one exists– judges he opined are concerned not with what the law should be but with what it is the absence of authority shows that no such duty to dorset yacht company now exists if there should be one that is in my view a matter for the legislature and not for the courts chapman comments that this conclusion appeared  distinctly quaint oldfashioned and even untenable in the light of donoghue shows how far the law had moved in the four decades which separated the two house of lords decisions caparo industries plc v dickmanedit in  the house of lords revised lord atkins neighbour principle to encompass public policy concerns articulated in caparo industries plc v dickman the threestage caparo test for establishing a duty of care requires i foreseeability of damage ii a relationship characterised by the law as one of proximity or neighbourhood and iii that the situation should be one in which the court considers it would be fair just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of given scope on one party for the benefit of the other in other jurisdictions such as new zealand there is now a twopart test for novel fact situations where the establishment of a duty must be balanced against applicable policy matters as a metaphoredit today the far reaching changes of the decision for the law of torts is sufficiently well recognised that the cases name is used as a metaphor for example barclays bank v w j simms   qb  has been described as the donoghue v stevenson of restitution for mistake it has also been stated that slades case could be said to be the donoghue v stevenson of contract similarly jarvis v swans tours ltd  ewca  has been called the donoghue v stevenson of tourism law commemorationedit the original memorial to donoghue v stevenson on the site of the former wellmeadow café in  a pilgrimage to paisley was organised by the canadian bar association the faculty of advocates and the law society of scotland this included a conference in paisley town hall entitled the pilgrimage to paisley a salute to donoghue v stevenson– a memorial commemorating the case was unveiled at the conference on the site of the former wellmeadow café and a bench was added in  both were replaced in  in  justice martin taylor produced a documentary on the case the paisley snail notesedit  scots law practice was to include both the married and maiden names of female litigants in the form maiden name or married name the maiden name for donoghue however has been listed as both mcalister and malister in the law reports even though she was born may mcallister pauper indicates that donoghue would have been unable to pay stevensons costs had she lost but was granted an exemption from providing the required security  although the friend was not named and has not been identified she is referred to as she in the house of lords judgment it has been suggested that this information was provided by counsel during the hearing  minghellas surname was incorrectly spelt as minchella in law reports of donoghue v stevenson  judgment was originally scheduled for  april but was delayed for unknown reasons although alan roger suggests that the delay gave lord macmillan time to rewrite his speech  it has also been reported that the case was settled for £ by william mcbryde on the basis of information from lord macmillan which he probably heard from lord normand one of stevensons counsel and £ by thomas donoghue may donoghues grandson however this amount is likely to be an exaggeration as it was the amount donoghue originally claimed  although authorship of an introduction to the law relative to trials at nisi prius has also been attributed to lord bathurst  the
