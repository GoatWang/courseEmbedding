we set out to build something completely new a venture capital fund to act as the connective tissue between the world’s largest owners and operators of physical space and the entrepreneurs redefining how the world interacts with their environments today we’re thrilled to announce fifth wall ventures has raised its first fund  million to invest in transformative technologies for the built world the largest ever fund dedicated to real estate technologywe’re in the early innings of one of the single biggest shifts in the history of the us economy the built world is rapidly colliding with technology transforming the way we interact with our physical environment and influencing the way we live work sleep consume move create connect and play the “built world” encompasses much more than buildings it represents an entire ecosystem of the companies who own and operate physical space and the innovative startups developing technologies that will transform optimize and democratize access to these spaces this ecosystem hasn’t yet fully been realizedfifth wall’s limited partners are the largest and most influential owners and operators of real estate in the world representing more than  billion of real estate and over  billion square feet across every major sector of the industry includingcbre largest brokerage and real estate services company in the worldequity residential one of the largest owner of apartments in the ushines largest developer of office buildings in the ushost hotels  resorts largest hospitality reit in the uslennar second largest homebuilder in the usmacerich third largest mall owner in the usprologis the global leader in industriallogistics real estate across the americas europe and asiafifth wall anchor lps photo dave mullenother lps include lowe’s home improvement and rudin management company these industryleading companies are the largest buyers partners and consumers of technology solutions for the built world when they adopt a given technology solution it often becomes the industry standardfifth wall lps are similar in their commitment to innovation and in their deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges that technology presents for the future of their businesses our shared vision has taken shape faster than we could have imagined with already  million of successful investments in some of the most transformational companies in this space bta classpass clutter notarize opendoor states title and vtswe envision a future where technology is seamlessly integrated into the physical spaces around us creating a shared environment that is more accessible efficient and delightful than ever before alongside m in spvs fifth wall today has  million assets under management to begin fulfilling our mission to accelerate innovation in the built worlda transformation on the cuspcontinuous innovation has transformed our digital lives an endless array of software and apps occupy our time — it’s estimated the average american spends more than onethird of their day in front of a screen the torrid pace of transformation and disruption in the digital world has fundamentally changed our society but what about the physical world around us where we in fact spend  of the time the physical spaces in which we live our lives have a far more profound influence on our lives our families our wellbeing and the economy at large yet somehow these physical environments remain largely untouched by the same levels of technological progressthe device or computer you’re reading this sentence on likely has more technology than the entire building you’re in at this moment there’s more software involved in purchasing your bedroom mattress or repaying your friend for lunch than financing the largest purchase of your life the home you sleep in every night the average multitenant office building likely uses the same manual ledger signin process for visitors that existed  years agoat 4 of gdp real estate is the largest industry in the us by a wide margin real estate is also the largest asset class capital market lending category and store of consumer wealth but the industry itself has historically been slow to adopt new technologies the average us industry spends about  of industry revenue on it the real estate industry about half a percentin  we first identified this unique whitespace in the venture capital ecosystem we were fortunate to have had professional experience in traditional real estate at blackstone goldman sachs tishman speyer and starwood capital and then as successful startup founders identified acquired by workday cabify and invitation homes that hybrid experience offered a rare perspective on how the largest industry on earth was on the cusp of a profound technology transformationwe noticed something quite surprising despite real estate’s slow pace of technology adoption venture capital investments in real estate and hospitality technology have already produced more multibillion dollar companies than any other industry apart from healthcare and life sciences less than  real estate and hospitality companies represent more than  billion of value led by two of the three largest “unicorns” today wework and airbnb marc andreessen once said that “software is eating the world” as so it is but as software eats the physical world the scale of the opportunity was proving to be staggeringly vast and the impact on our lives profoundfifth wall ventures team in venice photo dave mullenso why were there no significant real estate focused venture funds very few venture capitalists have any real estate industry experience and couldn’t speak to the challenges that entrepreneurs were facing in scaling their products to this enormous but idiosyncratic industry additionally real estate tech is a hard space to invest in why because success or failure for earlystage companies often hinges on the adoption decisions of a handful of industry incumbents entrepreneurs needed institutional validation for their transformational ideaswe decided to try a bold approach to solving this problem what if the biggest customers for built world technology could invest in and leverage their domain expertise to help the very entrepreneurs whose growth they were accelerating these corporates wanted to help entrepreneurs but a platform to do so hadn’t emerged and in a world filled with often undifferentiated venture capital investors built world entrepreneurs increasingly seek valueadded investors with a unique ability to understand and support their company’s growtha symbiotic relationshipmany of fifth wall’s lpportfolio company partnerships have already produced dramatic results portfolio company bta is a softwarepowered retailer designed to make physical retail accessible for makers and customers bta is designed to help people discover try and learn about new tech products in real life while empowering makers with a simple retailasaservice model that puts them in control of pricing marketing and product trainingfifth wall anchor lp macerich one of the nation’s leading owners operators and developers of oneofakind retail

all fifth wall lps immediate advantages for managing their cre deal workflow engaging with brokers and increasing lease conversion in fact for all of fifth wall’s portfolio companies we have structured similar partnerships and commercial agreements that dramatically accelerate the growth and industry adoption of their productsfifth wall believes the most profound change can derive not only from a reimagination of our digital lives but also from our physical world we’re excited about the road ahead because the traditional way we interact with space has always been limited by the technology that we can apply to it imagine what we can do when technology’s impact is truly unlimited to reimagine the physical spaces where we live our livesbrendan wallace  brad greiwe cofounders

wallace and brad greiwe updated may  0 am venture capital firm fifth wall ventures raised  million for what it claims is the first fund backed by real estate money that invests exclusively in property tech startups real estate companies like cbre prologis hines lennar host hotels equity residential and macerich properties invested around 0 million in the fund cofounder brendan wallace told the real deal with financial institutions providing the rest los angelesbased fifth wall founded last year has an unusual approach according to wallace it starts out by talking to its real estate investors to figure out what kind of tech products they would be interested in using then the firm goes out and finds startups that offer such products invests in them and introduces them to its new customers the firms that invested in fifth wall’s funds in other words the firm not only offers startups the money to grow but also the demand for its product wallace believes this gives it a competitive edge visavis other vc firms when it comes to winning over startups “the ability to influence outcomes for earlystage companies opens a lot of doors” he said so far fifth wall has invested around 0 million in half a dozen real estate tech startups including portfolio management software company vts home selling platform opendoor title insurance startup states title and storage provider clutter wallace added that the firm is in talks to invest in three more startups last month the wall street journal reported that fifth wall is negotiating to buy jared kushner’s stake in wiredscore which measures internet connectivity in buildings wallace declined to comment from an investor’s perspective fifth wall basically offers real estate firms a more systematic way of investing in tech products they use which some had already dabbled in the blackstone group’s real estate division for example invested in the portfolio management software company vts in  providing growth capital and a major customer in one stroke fifth wall’s cofounders wallace and brad greiwe both have real estate backgrounds wallace started his career as a real estate analyst at goldman sachs and worked for blackstone’s real estate division before switching to tech investments greiwe cofounded invitation homes blackstone’s single family rental housing investment firm that went public earlier this year   correction an
