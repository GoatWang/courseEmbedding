reports providers share on     common questionshow is credit score calculatedcredit score is calculated using three main values the calculation first looks at information on your account and profile your existing credit outstanding loans overdrafts it then checks public records for any black marks on you such as bankruptcies or summons the third factor is inquiries both on your part of applying for loans and credits and of lenders inquiring as to your credit score modern credit scores are also now calculated taking into account the credit score of everybody else to place you in a percentile which can influence your approval and interest ratedo too many inquiries still negatively affect my credit scoreit is often cited that having too many credit inquiries on your credit history can contribute to a low credit score whilst this is true in the long run and applying for a credit on a number of occasions over a long period of time can detrimentally affect your score a number of inquiries in a short space of time when shopping for the best interest rates is often recognized by credit scorers and not taken into consideration as ‘overinquiring’what is considered a goodbad credit scorecredit scores are calculated differently depending upon the agency carrying out the assessment across all of the main reporting bodies equifax vantagescore transunion fico experian the higher the score the lower the credit risk a low credit score will affect the consumer’s chances of being approved for credit and receiving low interest rates it is impossible to categorize a general ‘good’ or ‘bad’ score as it will depend upon the body calculating the score however receiving a favorable score from one body will normally mean that your credit score is good across all calculations

cash in the case of an emergency it is difficult to survive in the modern world without at least some type of credit – some experts are even predicting that paper money is going to soon become obsolete this dependence on credit also creates a number of disadvantages and this is why it can be so important to use services such as credit monitoring what is credit monitoringcredit monitoring basically means that you are paying attention to your current situation in regards to available credit the easiest way to do this is to just carefully read any statements you are sent from the companies providing you with a deferred payment service this traditional way of monitoring your credit score and information isn’t ideal because these statements usually only arrive once a month and they are always going to be outofdate ie if you used credit in the last few days it is unlikely to show up on your statementthe benefit of a credit monitoring service is that it allows you to keep a much closer eye on what is happening with your credit if there are mistakes or any suspicious behavior related to your account you can pick it up right away it also allows you to keep an eye on your credit score – this can be particularly important if you own a business this type of service is usually offered on a subscription basis – it means that the provider of the service will monitor your credit activity and alert you right away if there is anything unusual happening why is credit monitoring importantone of the most common reasons for choosing credit monitoring is to reduce the likelihood of identity theft the fact that so many of us rely on credit these days means that this can be a particular profitable crime – it also involves relatively little risk if somebody can pretend to be you it means they can use your credit you could find yourself facing a ton of debt along with the handicap of a poor credit score identity theft means that you have been the victim of a crime but it can be very hard to prove this the benefit of credit monitoring is you can spot any suspicious behavior almost right away and deal with itan additional benefit of finding the best credit monitoring agency that suits your needs it that they offer services that allow you to track and monitor your credit score this is useful information because it indicates how easy it is going to be for you to borrow money in the future – if you know you have a bad credit score you can take action to improve it business owners can use credit report monitoring to find out about anyone who is making inquiries about their financial situationone of the other benefits of a credit monitoring service is that it can provide very detailed information about your financial situation you can expect to have access to comprehensive reports that provide a clear overview of your different lines of credit – there may be graphs that clearly show how your credit is distributed you can also easily look back on your payment history to check for any mistakes or just for reference purposes this information can also be useful because it can allow you to assess if you could save money by moving your credit around how to find the best credit reports servicethe type of information and service you are going to get with credit monitoring can vary a great deal some credit reports agencies cater mostly for businesses and they provide very comprehensive reports in order to find the best credit report company for you it is important to first consider your needs – it’s not really worth paying extra for services you are never going to useone of the other things to consider when choosing a credit monitoring service is the number of credit reports it tracks if you are looking for this type of service in the us you want a company that is able to conduct  bureau credit monitoring you also want to have these reports tracked on a daily basisit is important that you are able to protect your lines of
