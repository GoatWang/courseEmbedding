twitter share this article on facebook email this article download this article kleiner perkins caufield  byers design partner john maeda talks to mckinsey’s hugo sarrazin about why today’s senior executives must understand design video design was once largely about making products more attractive today it’s a way of thinking a creative process that spans entire organizations driven by the desire to better understand and meet consumer needs in this conversation mckinsey director hugo sarrazin and kleiner perkins caufield  byers design partner and former president of the rhode island school of design john maeda discuss how design has moved from the drafting table to the boardroom—and all functions in between an edited transcript of their remarks follows interview transcript hugo sarrazin you have been around design for a long time and it means so many things for so many different folks you looked at it from different angles—from the technical from the arts and from leading a great design school the rhode island school of design how do you define what design is today and what should executives think about john maeda the word “design” has a very simple definition good design is good business this came from t j watson jr in a  memo to all of ibm  for more on ibm’s view of design see “good design is good business” ibmcom certain kinds of design have strategic value it has a multiplier effect it is design that can be instrumented and then design where the process is changing because you are now saving time and saving time is saving money read more about digital article building a designdriven culture article what every executive needs to know about design podcast  mckinsey quarterly how companies become digital leaders hugo sarrazin a question i get a lot is why now why is design so important now and why is it a csuite type of topic john maeda moore’s law’s efficacy is dwindling we have enough processing power therefore we aren’t driven to buy it because it’s faster or has more memory so now we have to buy it because of how it makes us feel but not only that—steve jobs died and that was a big deal i remember the day he died i got an email from john hockenberry of new york publicradio station wnyc at  am “steve jobs died people want to know what this design thing he did was” i remember that moment i was on the radio at  am on npr  national public radio i realized no one really knew what this thing was that jobs had marketed as being “magical design” and they wanted to understand it so moore’s law is dwindling—and that big moment that’s what’s catapulted all this here hugo sarrazin and i’d add a few other things one is that the advent of mobile is fundamentally changing the need to think about design the interaction and the experience in a substantive way the last one is that we just have a new generation of folks who are being trained on this and i think that’s good it doesn’t mean that immediately the csuite people are going to wake up and say “this is important” it’s just that you now have expectations of solving problems differently and that is now embedded in both how they got educated and also what they’re using in terms of products out there great expectations for design hugo sarrazin i do think we have a danger the expectations are that the only way to create value is a steve jobs–type of moment john maeda whenever someone has come to me asking for the silver bullet i say “there’s only a silver ray and you have to know where to point it and you might get lucky” hugo sarrazin well the other thing too that we often get is impatience “sprinkle that design dust and magic will happen” it’s just the wrong way to think about the problem i think design is a mindset it’s a set of capabilities and skills it does require an environment to flourish it requires people to work in a collaborative way that is different than it’s been historically so just thinking that sprinkling a bunch of magic design dust—and you’re quickly going to get to a new product a new experience—is a bit naive john maeda i talk to a lot of startups and i was talking to a ceo who was formerly a doctor i love ceos who come up a weird path he was a medical professional doctor—a real doctor—but he’s very curious about design so he retained some design firm early on he’s very curious about how it all works now he’s about to release his product—and everyone’s telling him to gamify to social this that whatever he asked me what i thought i usually do not offer my opinion because i’m always concerned that it will cause the wrong effect but in this case i had to offer my opinion which was “just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should do it” if you think about design adding value a lot of what people don’t understand is that sometimes the best design consultants will tell you not to design it measuring design’s worth john maeda one thing i’ve noticed is that—so now we assume that because usage patterns have changed design is important because it can’t be bad anymore—that funny word “measurement” comes in how do i measure if it’s good or not how do you approach that hugo sarrazin i’m going to make the question even broader we’ve forever questioned “what’s the return on investment on design” that is an incredibly incredibly difficult question and it’s not unlike “how do you measure the value of a brand” so i’m going to give you two things one is you can instrument your design more so today and because you have more ability to measure you can see if it’s being used you can receive feedback on what is being used how it’s being used and that kind of stuff so that’s one dimension that is very very very different and in a world where we’re going to have so much data it’s going to allow you to measure good design versus bad design the second is i think we’re changing the way to even land on the design you can do a whole lot more rapid prototyping iteration at a scale that is very different connecting design to the business hugo sarrazin as a large company you think about applying design principles design thinking what do you see as some of the challenges and some of the ways that seem to work better john maeda well i had the good luck of getting to work with john donahoe on the ebay companies  john donahoe was president and ceo of ebay from march  to july  for more on ebay see michelle angier and beth axelrod “realizing the power of talented women” mckinsey quarterly september  and “paypal’s vision for a global marketplace” august  through brian chesky  brian chesky is the cofounder and ceo of airbnb for more see “the future of airbnb in cities” november  he wanted to find someone who could help him as ceo to get his design function working at a different rate and scale and so i showed up and the first thing i did was i didn’t overpromise i said “i don’t think i’m going to be able to do anything ok let’s set expectations low” what i did is i understood that the only challenge you have for organizations at scale is that culture is hard to create because you’re busy what i observed is that the designers were all spread out and they couldn’t see each other so i connected all of them together all something of them into one community that could see each other and the ceo could see them i remember john saying “oh so design isn’t about this pixels thing it’s about systems thinking” i’m a systems thinker “oh so it isn’t just about the appearance” he totally got it and all the designers would see him get it it’s that moment where a leader gets to lead so i saw that happen it took a year it’s not going to be a gsb  stanford graduate school of business case study but if you can just get that to happen in an authentic way— hugo sarrazin so it’s getting the right people together creating the sense of community it’s also reframing what it is john maeda reframing exactly article actions share this article on linkedin share this article on twitter share

ethnic specific which white products are good for black hair october      by stacie forrest  comments  of tv and print advertisements are loaded with product promotion in the beauty industry as it has to be – how else are we going to learn about the latest and greatest mascara and dark spot corrector because hair is our greatest accessory hair products are equally important each promising to do something great for our coifs like provide better nourishment shiny hair and prevention of split endswe can pretty much gauge which make up products complement our deeper hued skin tone but hair products can take a bit more research gone are the days when we relied solely on ultra sheen and luster’s pink oil moisturizer today’s hair care market is saturated with styling tools and remedies guaranteed to revitalize dull lifeless hair and interestingly enough the products offering and delivering some of the best results are products made by and for our european brothers and sisters there is no doubt that some of my besttressed sister girls rely on some of these hair care staplespantenethis tried and true product is sensitive to the needs of africanamerican hair so much so they introduced the relaxed  natural line just for us a leader in the industry for promotion of strong healthy hair this shower stall staple has delivered the best in at home hair care for all ethnicitieswenthat’s no typo the wen hair care system is creating quite a buzz in the african american community their approach is simple take away the extra the perfumes dyes and all the other harsh ingredients that can strip hair of its natural oils and moisture – and you’re left with frizzfree soft and shiny hair stylist sherry miles says this “one of my every week clients went away on vacation for three weeks and to be honest with you i was really worried about what kind of condition her hair would be in when she returned but it was if she never left i was convinced that she had her hair done while she was away until i used the product on my own hair i now use it in my salon”garnier nutrisseonce when she was low on color and her favorite beauty supply space was closed my mother and veteran hair stylist brenda forrest had to make a mad dash to the local drug store to find a replacement and now four years later garnier nutrisse has become her brand of choice “the conditioners are so rich and i was so impressed with how well it covered my client’s gray” apparently the grapeseed and avocado oil really sets this product apart because not only does it deliver amazing coverage and true tonal value but women have actually seen hair texture and overall hair condition dramatically improveavedaaveda does everything well from skin care to hair care and everything in between the aveda brand has staying power and has proven to be a leader in the industry using only plantderived ingredients this brand was built on an environment conscious platform creating products that had

adverse to supporting black owned companies but they’re pricing themselves out of the market for average and below income brackets i mean really  dollars for less than  oz of curl puddings hair cream etc… a bit ridiculous and hard to choose them when something equitable can be found for less and works well nicole jazzette johnson i’m glad to hear that i’m not alone regarding pantene it made my hair hard dry and brittle which was soo far from normal that i tossed it immediately and went back to a different store further away to get what i normally use so much for saving myself time and gas smh jane now i lost trust from the very beginning in this article the moment they put pantene first because everyone i have ever talked to about washing my hair have saidno to pantene it has sulfates which are harsh and strip your hair’s nutrients protein and moisture and ultimately weaken your hair my aunt cousin every hair dresser i ever had multiple online forums and actual research into the affects of sulfates on the hair have made me realize that pantene was not great for black hair nadegeous last time i used pantene i looked like a barbie that’s been carried around in dirt for  years…my hair were all dried up and so lifeless they had a tint of grey they were hard as plastic never again pingback compare massage heights houston for sale locally » get the show on the road

white flakes and no breakouts along the hair line hair ninae whatever happened to being entitled to your opinion…good gracious and im assuming that all of us here are black women wow so much for the encourgement… leslove  wow alot of these comments are so negative i dont think that the writer was trying to push any product on anyone – just expressing an opinion of perhaps what she herself or stylists or other consumers may have used if you dont like the products and they dont work for you thats okay there are a few products in this list i agree with a few i dont but cmon dont be mean and the majority of these comments are mean elise um actually these products are being pushed on you proctor and gamble makes pantene proctor and gamble pay for advertising tide detergent on this site you don’t think this isn’t advertising too hello wake up black people white people green people anyone who has money is susceptible to brainwashing if you don’t think for yourselves pingback the “precious” effect black women and weight problems kissing up this article is one big commercial for chemicals that arent good for anybodys hair silicones ammonia waxes etc take a tip from grandma – wash with prell and coconut oil egg and honey or just vo conditioner rinse with vinegar  water then oil with coconut olive or jojoba oil use henna indigo and honey to adjust color plus youll live longer lynnemery this article saying wen doesnt have perfumes in them is incorrect wen products do contain perfume so if youre like me and allergic to fragrance pass those up anjela the list is fine yall but please remember to support the black owned natural hair product companies like kinky curly afro veda uncle funkys daughter and my honey child lets try to support black businesses the products i mentioned are excellent and really saved my natural hair amc will support our black owned natural hair product companies if they stay true to having natural ingredients only why are companies such as miss jessies taliah waajid and a few others putting harmful chemicals in their supposed natural products and charging an arm and a leg jessica lucinda williams and not to mention the cost especially miss jessies i have three daughters thick and long hair hair to do plus my own i will be broke trying to support miss jessies rosie amen to that my mom and i have used miss jesse’s crap and it dried the hell out of our hair same with wen just tried a new company called soultanicals and i am hooked all natural leaves my hair soft and black owned shea moisture is really good as well girla i would love to support black owned companies but why are they so high though i want my hair to be healthy but i’m balling on a college student budget therefore i have to use products that fit my budget… crystal okay so when i saw the title of this article my first thought was “who has paid them to advertise these products”…only product i know to be good for my hair is wen the rest can kick rocks jjac crystal – i am a natural sista and you are right about wen wen is the truth simplyressy hey can you give me more information on wen i’m going natural haven’t permed in  months i’m considering using wen but still indecisive any suggestions feri john frieda is the truth salon quality but drug store ok a little higher than most drug store prices too bad its not all natural i always get compliments on how shiny and bouncy my hair is i like that their products keep my hair moisturized but not too greasy and weighed down another good product for curlskinks is head and shoulders  in  moisturizing shampoo i dont have dandruff but i use it because the shampoo actually has conditioner in it so it doesnt strip my hair but it leaves it feeling really clean and moisturized than i use a john freida conditioner and styling products lalalameansiloveyou wait a minute im confused now since going natural ive been reading a lot on whats good and whats not good for natural hair most of the things that ive read some even on this website say that any hair products that contain alcohol sulfates and petrolatum are not good for our hair which leads me to the question how did pantene yes even the line they created supposedly for us make  on this list i was in the store not even a month ago with their shampoo and conditioner in my cart because they packaged it all nice and shiny and boasted naturals on the front…then i read the list of ingredients and guess which product had all  of them in it exactly ladies we have to stop trusting these websites and magazines essence had a similar rave review of pantenes rn products that supposedly have our best interests at heart when in reality they are most likely being paid in some way from these companies to push theses harmful products on us because they know that we trust them and are too lazy to do the research for ourselves to the author of this article may i suggest next time doing better research on the products you push on us bbsinclair some people like pantene some dont my natural sisters hair thrives on pantene my natural hair doesnt every natural doesnt follow the same rules and buy the same products this site is for entertainment with basic info you should take it as such whats good for the goose is good may not be good for the gander buy what you like and let others do the same i for one use products with mineral oils and have had better growthmoisture retention mineral oil stops water from escaping maybe consider that the author has to write broad articles for all readers if you dont like product fine but someone else might jessica lucinda williams amen i for one believe that if it keeps my hair from breaking off i’ll use it that “bb hair grease has mineral oil and it keeps my hair from breaking maybe it breaks someone elses but i haven’t had that experience elise you’re right i’ve done tons readhours and hours of research about products that are good for our hair and the crap in pantene is not good pantene is made by proctor and gamble which also makes tide detergent please look to the sides of this blog and tell me you don’t see tide detergent ads right nowboom is everything the end don’t believe everything you’re told everyone has a motive lyla maroon i just saw a tide ad right now if pantene is dangerous why is it still on the marketmore people have curls kinks and waves not straight hair but yet again most products are for fine hair that is not fair cheekee baby there leave in conditioner is great most products on the market have these harmful ingredients this article does not claim to offer natural  healthy hair care products for our hair hello they’re touting a box dye but if homegirl is in her local walmart with no more than  to spend on her hair care products and doesn’t have hours to boil blend and grow her own natural stuff this list would help her out stay in the knowsign up for the newsletter popular stories weve joined the bhm
