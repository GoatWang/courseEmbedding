after purchase date publication date september   the senior portfolio manager at national securities inc national is concerned about the recent decline in shares of agnicoeagle mines ltd aem a canadian gold producer with several years of precious metals mining experience that was considered one of the portfolios strongest performers the senior portfolio manager and his team recently spent time at one of aems mines and believed in the operational potential of the company nationals research department had prepared free cash flow forecasts for aem which the senior portfolio manager reviewed and modified following their visit with the company he knew that despite his teams belief in the future prospects of aem the stock may have become overvalued from a fundamental view point the senior portfolio manager asked his team to perform a fundamental valuation of the equity of aem as normally this meant the team would use the discounted cash flow dcf methodology with financial

at decision nodes during the life of the company with regards to extracting commodities from the ground as a result the senior portfolio manager reminded the team that the dcf method when applied to a mining company had to be expanded to explicitly include the value of the unmined metals the underground unmined gold would need to be valued as a real option using an adjusted blackscholes model
