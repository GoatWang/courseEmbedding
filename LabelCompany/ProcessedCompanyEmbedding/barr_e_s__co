whose prospects we can evaluate philosophyat e s barr  company we invest in publicly traded securities as if we were buying into a private business we look at economic prospects owners’ earnings versus reported earnings and management’s ability as measured by past results we seek a wide difference between the market price and the intrinsic value of the underlying business what we call “margin of safety” before we commit capital we believe operating results over time not daily price quotations determine whether our investments are successful even though the market may ignore business success in the short term it will eventually confirm it our primary goal is to deliver superior riskadjusted investment results through multiple market cycles in other words we put as much emphasis on preserving capital as we do on creating wealth our research seeks out financially strong companies with a history of producing consistently high returns on invested capital roic generating free cash flow earnings the owner could receive from the business and ability to reinvest at high rates of return ideally that would be a company that has an exclusive product or service in high demand with significant barriers for a potential competitor to challenge and not have its prices subject to regulation we look for companies whose management has an outstanding track record is investorfriendly and is apt to buy their own stock when it is trading at a discount to intrinsic value we choose companies based on their own merits not compared to other companies in the same sector we only purchase securities when we feel there is an attractive “absolute value” we will not engage in purchasing an overvalued company because it is “relatively attractive” versus an even more overvalued company once we buy we are content to hold indefinitely as long as the operating results are satisfactory future prospects appear promising and the market does not grossly overvalue the business fees  e s barr
