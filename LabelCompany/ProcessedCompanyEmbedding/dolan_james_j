garden he supervises daytoday operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks which include msg network and msg plus he also serves as a governor of the knicks and rangers to their respective leagues controversies new york knicks like the rangers the knicks performed abysmally in the early s and have yet to recover which fans mostly blame on dolans management missteps although the knicks made the nba finals in  they have not posted a winning season until the  season furthermore the knicks had not made the playoffs from the  season to the  season which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the knicks dolan has come under fire from many knicks fans for the teams run of consecutive losing seasons from  to  numerous mediawho and informal fan polls including a recent sports illustrated poll have ranked dolan the worst owner in the nba in  nba commissioner david stern criticized dolans management of the knicks saying theyre not a model of intelligent management one widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard allan houston a year  million maximum contract in  when no other team had offered houston more than  million houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over  million remaining on his contract in  dolan hired isiah thomas as team president of basketball operations and general manager to replace embattled executive scott layden thomas made aggressive moves to retool and upgrade the knicks roster through trades the nba draft and free agency despite the talent thomas imported the team did not perform up to expectations and thomas was often the target of the frustration of knick fans dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of knicks fans for his commitment to thomas in spite of thomas sometimes questionable decisions after the  season the knicks signed head coach larry brown to a year  million contract after just one losing season brown was fired and the team boughtout browns contract for  million brown walked away with a total of  million for coaching the knicks for just one year after firing larry brown isiah thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the knicks during a staged interview on msg network which is the last time dolan answered questions from the media dolan gave thomas an ultimatum to show evident progress or potentially be fired in the latter half of the  season with the knicks within reach of a playoff spot dolan signed thomas to a multiyear contract extension the team subsequently fell out of contention and dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of thomas contract the next season dolan stripped thomas of his front office duties because thomas had taken the knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure new team president donnie walsh removed thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season other coaches that also had shortlived tenures as head coaches of the knicks include don chaney – and lenny wilkens – like thomas and brown they remained on the knicks payroll following their departure from the bench due to multiyear contracts signed with the owner and in chaneys case  separate contract extensions in  dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former knicks executive anucha brownesanders brownesanders accused dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from isiah thomas the court ruled in favor of brownsanders and dolan had to pay  million of the  million settlement msg was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement in july  dolan faced criticism for allowing popular knicks point guard jeremy lin to sign with the houston rockets without matching their  million offer in february  dolan responded to a letter from irving bierman a yearold lifelong knicks fan that criticized dolans ownership of the knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own telling the fan to root for the nets because the knicks dont want you and that bierman was a sad person and probably an alcoholic maybe dolan later addressed the issue with the press but did not apologize only saying the letter was a case of tit for tat and declaring the incident over newly appointed nba commissioner adam silver did not reprimand or penalize dolan but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling dolan a consummate new yorker” who received an unkind email and responded with an unkind email” on february   former knicks player charles oakley was removed from madison square garden during a knicks–clippers game following an altercation with msg security oakley contends that dolan has ignored if not ostracized him new york rangers after winning the stanley cup in  the rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of dolans increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the  season until the – nhl lockout despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years this was the longest playoff drought in the franchises history in part due to questionable expensive freeagent signings such as eric lindros pavel bure and theo fleury despite fan and media calls for the teams general manager glen sather to be fired for the organizations shortcomings sather was retained however since the resolution of the nhl lockout in  dolan has allowed sather to rebuild from the ground up which has led to a revival of the club and the organization culminating with a trip to the eastern conference finals in  their first since  however when dolan spoke of the teams stanley cup chances in january  rangers head coach john tortorella took issue with his remarks i have my owner up here talking about a stanley cup thats a bunch of bullshit tortorella said in response we need to take it one game at a time new york liberty on may   dolan announced that isiah thomas would serve as president of the wnba’s liberty considering thomas history being both a failed presidentgm of the knicks and thomas being implicated in the anucha brownesanders sexual harassment incident it was questioned by many fans and members of the press media policies dolan rarely speaks
