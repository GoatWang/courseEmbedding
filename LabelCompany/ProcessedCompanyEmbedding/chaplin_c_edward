apparatuses the board of bureau chiefs of the united states navy considered supplying the cruisers uss baltimore c and uss philadelphia c with distilling apparatuses to provide fresh water for the

unskilled attendants to safely operate the alexander chaplin distilling apparatus is among the forms of apparatus which have most fully satisfied such conditions apparatusedit chaplins distilling apparatus in  catalog the alexander chaplin  co distilling apparatus was designed initially for use on board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a pump driven from the main engine or an auxiliary the subsequent addition of a steam powered circulating pump integral with the apparatus meant it could then also be used as a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey auxiliary boiler such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches the apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately  feet  m in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water the casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper the coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine or from a feed directly from the boiler a circulating pump either driven from the main engine on a steam ship or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser a covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at the upper end of the steam coil in operation a steam jet drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure as it passed down the coil the airsteam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil the aerated water would collect as a clear bright and odourless liquid at a temperature of about  °c  °f at the bottom of the coil to be drawn off for use the machine could supply approximately  us gallons  l  imp gal of water per hour the samples of water subjected to analysis were collected at different times directly from the patent apparatus on board ship and the results of my experiments with the water distilled in alexander chaplin  cos are conclusive in showing that is of excellent quality in every particular the integrated circulating pump of the later arrangement could also be used as a fire engine in the event of an emergency the outlet pipe from the cooling water chamber could be fitted with a cock by which way the water could be directed to a fitted union to which a firehose could be attached the optimum arrangement would place the apparatus in the stokehold or anywhere below deck where a reliable steam and cooling water supply could be efficiently provided it could also be placed on the main deck or any other convenient part of the vessel subject to adequate water and steam supplies being maintained as long as fuel was available to make steam the chaplin distiller offered a potential economic benefit in that the space and weight previously set aside for larger water tanks could be used more productively to carry additional cargo according to the manufacturers specifications and a report generated by dr frederick penny phd frse professor of chemistry andersonian university glasgow the distiller filtered out noxious chemicals such as lead copper tin and iron through the use of a series of iron plates with perforated holes and matting these plates were located in the large boxlike structure at the bottom of the apparatus apparatus aboard ss xanthoedit precisely when the chaplin distiller was installed on xantho is open to conjecture it is known that from  xantho operated out of wick west sussex and was permitted to take excursions to sea it is possible that this apparatus was installed during this period of time it is more feasible however that this device was installed at a later date as part of the major refurbishing programme implemented by the metal merchant robert stewart who in  completely and radically reengineered the ship replacing the original side paddlewheel steam propulsion with a new marine fire tube boiler and screw propulsion utilising a secondhand horizontal trunk engine designed by john penn and son excavation and confirmation of identityedit distiller canister of ss xantho the chaplin distiller was excavated from the steamship xantho wreck site in  it was found outside the hull on the port side of the vessel it is likely that this apparatus was installed in the ships engine space and as a result of the wreck sites natural transformation had been displaced by the strong transverse current as the surrounding hull framing and plating gave way falling out onto the seabed initial speculation was that this may be a condenser or a heat exchanger or perhaps a circle condenser  but the discovery of a brass manufacturers nameplate found whilst deconcreting the object and subsequent archival documentation has confirmed its identity to be a chaplin distilling apparatus on recovery the artefact was found to be in very fragile condition with the cast iron shell badly corroded and incomplete additionally there is evidence to suggest that the artefact is missing many of its mountings such as the aerator connecting pipes and donkey engine it is inconclusive whether these materials were removed by agents operating under the direction of the owner charles edward broadhurst  –  april  in the initial salvaging of the wreck in  or by treasure hunters in more recent times distiller coil from ss xantho this chaplin distiller which was damaged during the excavation and treatment processes is currently being reconstructed at the western australian museum by the department of maritime archaeology it is envisaged that this rebuilding process will be completed by  and that it will be available for public viewing in the steamships to suffragettes gallery shortly thereafter because of its fragmented state and damage to the coil it is not possible at this stage to confirm exact dimensions for this apparatus a rough estimate would suggest something in the order of  ft  in  m but a definitive answer will be able to be determined once it is reassembled and the coil has been correctly aligned and integrated the chaplin distilling apparatus excavated from xantho is believedby whom to be the only known example in existence and therefore can be regarded as a unique piece of maritime history that helps to explain how steamships and sailing vessels fitted with these devices were able to undertake prolonged

may be cleared out and proceed on her voyage having on board in tanks or casks only half the quantity of pure water required by the said act to be carried for the use of the passengers provided that…there be on board such ship an efficient apparatus for distilling fresh water from salt water this combined with the convenience and compact size of the apparatus made the alexander chaplin model very popular in direct competition with alexander chaplin dr alphonse normandy’s – apparatus is another successful distiller it consists of three essential parts the evaporator the condenser and the refrigerator the apparatus passes a mixture of steam and gasses from the evaporator to the tubes of the condenser normandys distiller was very complex in structure consisting of many numerous working parts with an elaborate layout and expensive cost the distiller wasnt economically viable for smaller vessels in france the apparatus of rocher and nantes and that of galle and mazeline of havre have been highly appreciated by french authorities and french seamen method of operationedit for successful preparation of potable water from seawater the following conditions of a distilling apparatus were deemed essential first the distilled product must be aerated so it may be immediately available for drinking and storage purposes second the amount of coal used to obtain the maximum volume of drinkable water must be at a minimum expenditure level and third the apparatus working parts must be simple enough to prevent from breaking down and to enable unskilled attendants to safely operate the alexander chaplin distilling apparatus is among the forms of apparatus which have most fully satisfied such conditions apparatusedit chaplins distilling apparatus in  catalog the alexander chaplin  co distilling apparatus was designed initially for use on board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a pump driven from the main engine or an auxiliary the subsequent addition of a steam powered circulating pump integral with the apparatus meant it could then also be used as a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey auxiliary boiler such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches the apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately  feet  m in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water the casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper the coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine or from a feed directly from the boiler a circulating pump either driven from the main engine on a steam ship or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser a covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at the upper end of the steam coil in operation a steam jet drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure as it passed down the coil the airsteam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil the aerated water would collect as a clear bright and odourless liquid at a temperature of about  °c  °f at the bottom of the coil to be drawn off for use the machine could supply approximately  us gallons  l  imp gal of water per hour the samples of water subjected to analysis were collected at different times directly from the patent apparatus on board ship and the results of my experiments with the water distilled in alexander chaplin  cos are conclusive in showing that is of excellent quality in every particular the integrated circulating pump of the later arrangement could also be used as a fire engine in the event of an emergency the outlet pipe from the cooling water chamber could be fitted with a cock by which way the water could be directed to a fitted union to which a firehose could be attached the optimum arrangement would place the apparatus in the stokehold or anywhere below deck where a reliable steam and cooling water supply could be efficiently provided it could also be placed on the main deck or any other convenient part of the vessel subject to adequate water and steam supplies being maintained as long as fuel was available to make steam the chaplin distiller offered a potential economic benefit in that the space and weight previously set aside for larger water tanks could be used more productively to carry additional cargo according to the manufacturers specifications and a report generated by dr frederick penny phd frse professor of chemistry andersonian university glasgow the distiller filtered out noxious chemicals such as lead copper tin and iron through the use of a series of iron plates with perforated holes and matting these plates were located in the large boxlike structure at the bottom of the apparatus apparatus aboard ss xanthoedit precisely when the chaplin distiller was installed on xantho is open to conjecture it is known that from  xantho operated out of wick west sussex and was permitted to take excursions to sea it is possible that this apparatus was installed during this period of time it is more feasible however that this device was installed at a later date as part of the major refurbishing programme implemented by the metal merchant robert stewart who in  completely and radically reengineered the ship replacing the original side paddlewheel steam propulsion with a new marine fire tube boiler and screw propulsion utilising a secondhand horizontal trunk engine designed by john penn and son excavation and confirmation of identityedit distiller canister of ss xantho the chaplin distiller was excavated from the steamship xantho wreck site in  it was found outside the hull on the port side of the vessel it is likely that this apparatus was installed in the ships engine space and as a result of the wreck sites natural transformation had been displaced by the strong transverse current as the surrounding hull framing and plating gave way falling out onto the seabed initial speculation was that this may be a condenser or a heat exchanger or perhaps a circle condenser  but the discovery of a brass manufacturers nameplate found whilst deconcreting the object and subsequent archival documentation has confirmed its identity to be a chaplin distilling apparatus on recovery the artefact was found to be in very fragile condition with the cast iron shell badly corroded and incomplete additionally there is evidence to suggest that the artefact is missing many of its mountings such as the aerator connecting pipes and donkey engine it is inconclusive whether these materials were removed by agents operating under the direction of the owner charles edward broadhurst  –  april  in the initial salvaging of the wreck in  or by treasure hunters in more recent times distiller coil from ss xantho this chaplin distiller which was damaged during the excavation and treatment processes is currently being reconstructed at the western australian museum by the department of maritime archaeology it is envisaged that this rebuilding process will be completed by  and that it will be available for public viewing in the steamships to suffragettes gallery shortly thereafter because of its fragmented state and damage to the coil it is not possible at this stage to confirm exact dimensions for this apparatus a rough estimate would suggest something in the order of  ft  in  m but a definitive answer will be able to be determined once it is reassembled and the coil has been correctly aligned and integrated the chaplin distilling apparatus excavated from xantho is believedby whom to be the only known example in existence and therefore can be regarded as a unique piece of maritime history that helps to explain how steamships and sailing vessels fitted with these devices were able to undertake prolonged voyages at sea with a minimal
