emitting diode is an exciting technology that is coming into its own at this time it promises to provide energy savings reduction in maintenance costs and change our industry this next generation light source is being tapped for general illumination purposes in both commercial and residential applicationsthe technology although not new is still in its infancy with much more work to be done in order for it to evolve into a full blown lighting source much the same way that we currently view metal halide and fluorescent technologiesled’s require more attention to how they are put together within a specific luminaire with regard to how they interact with the other components more so then any of the current mainstream technologies that are out thereour goal at voigt is to marry these components so that we achieve higher outputs better luminous efficacy and a long life so that our products live up to the promise of longer life less maintenance and ultimately save energy costs and help our environmentvoigt lighting is a member of the department of energy solid state lighting program and has taken a pledge to provide the best in led technology as is possible thank you paul

voigt by roger russell these pages are copyrighted no portion of this site may be reproduced in whole or in part without written permission of the author   in the beginning brociner model  lowther tp   in the beginning   paul g a h voigt was born in london on december   he was educated at dulwich college and university college london receiving a b sc  degree in electrical engineering in  among many other audio contributions and  patents he can be credited with the first high flux energized speaker drive unit and horns using the tractrix contour while with the edison bell works in london voigt started work on his loudspeaker when the company went under in  he set up his own company voigt patents ltd based in sydenham london under agreement with bell he remained the owner the  patents that he received on his ideas the domestic corner horn at the right was released in  and set a new record for high quality sound reproduction this unique design gave an extremely lifelike nondirectional presentation with the sound entering the room at a height between  and  feet from the floor   a unique feature of the voigt designs is the use of a single driver that covers the entire frequency range this is done using a mechanical crossover commonly known as a whizzer the driver then consists of a main cone and a short cone both of which are attached to the same voice coil bass frequencies are radiated by loading the rear of the driver with a folded horn enclosure in addition paul took great pride in designing the drivers with very high efficiency and concentrating  very high flux density in the magnetic gap this was accomplished using a very small gap making the centering of the voice coil very critical   about this time paul met op lowther from the lowther manufacturing company and eventually this resulted in a merge between the two companies this became lowthervoigt radio   during the war paul was kept busy maintaining his horn speakers installed in cinemas after the war priority was given to the design of a new driver using new magnet materials and drive unit having a flux density of  gauss  tesla it was released in    unfortunately due to poor health and slow sales paul decided to move to canada with his wife in  and set up north american sales for his new designs the company folded because of the korean war he taught electronics for a while and then moved to ottawa and worked for the canadian government in radio regulations he retired in  and pursued other interests   he died on february   leaving a legacy of his inventions geoffery l wilson wrote a glowing memoriam about him in the april  issue of the journal of the audio engineering society paul klipsch contributed and mentioned that paul voigt was one of the unsung pioneers in audio donald aldous also write a nice memoriam in the june issue of audio magazine more information can be found at the lowther museum   i did get a chance to speak with paul voigt following the 7 audio engineering society aes meeting in new york city we talked about several things but i gathered that he had some reservations about how his invention was being used at lowther and things were not as amicable as i was led to previously believe the next day he was presented with an honorary membership in the aes i also found it strange that neither memoriam mentioned his association with lowther although other companies were mentioned   meanwhile donald chave who was previously lowthers chief engineer had bought the company after world war ii he finally developed the pm driver using the voigt cone assembly before paul had left it was agreed that lowther would produce the domestic corner horn under license about  corner horns were produced between  and the early s chave later expanded the products and developed new drivers based on the early voigt units       stewart hegeman was also involved with lowther in the early s in  lowther released the incredible lowther hegeman reproducer which was threetimes the price of a lowther voigt domestic corner horn the enclosure was four feet wide four feet tall and two feet deep   the newlydeveloped pma drive unit was used inside a large horizontal plaster horn giving an amazingly wide dispersion of mid and treble frequencies it was a result of a collaboration between stuart  british spelling hegeman and donald chave of lowther later in the s hegeman and chave also developed the harman kardon citation x driver lowther still exists today although similar drivers are now being sold by other companies as well     lowther tp     early versions of the lowther tp speaker system had the driver in a box protruding top of the enclosure it used the pm driver that was based on the pma flux density  tesla impedance  ohms power handling  watts the pma driver is an improved version having a flux density of  tesla the  tpd system pictured above has no top on the box     brociner model    my first audition with the voigt design was when i heard the brociner model  speaker system at the  new your hifi show the system was used in the tetrad diamond room i was very impressed with the sound the design was similar to the lowther tp system made in england although only a single system was playing mono in those days it sounded very clean and smooth it did require corner placement i was only a student then and could not even afford one let alone two   victor brociner had a business in new york city and made amplifiers and preamplifiers plus the model  he later went to work for university loudspeakers in white plains ny i was actually interested to get a job there since it was only a few miles from home but they were not hiring after an evening session at the aes victor told me university was an ulcer factory then university moved to oklahoma and soon victor started his own speaker company called avid based in rhode island     in  the brociner model  had been demonstrated in room  at the fourth audio fair in the hotel new yorker from october  to november  other brociner equipment included the brociner a preampequalizer ca control amplifier ul ultralinear williamson power amplifier model  transcentent way corner reproducer and the ductflex coaxial speaker cabinet in attendance were victor brociner and a stewart hegeman right next door in room  was mcintosh engineering laboratory  water street binghamton ny in attendance were frank mcintosh and gordon gow demonstrating their audio amplifiers among others in attendance for harvey radio in room  was james carroll       the brociner c used the lowther pm driver     here is a pm driver in need of repair     about this site return to my main page   created by roger russell all contents are copyrighted all rights reserved     voigt
