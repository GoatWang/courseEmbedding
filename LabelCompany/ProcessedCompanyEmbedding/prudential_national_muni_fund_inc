the global bond markets are changing the global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities we believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixedincome landscape interest rates may challenge investors opportunities exist across the globe across the spectrum divergence in global growth lower liquidity may mean higher volatility can your portfolio keep up we believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns  overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their longterm investments not individual bonds
