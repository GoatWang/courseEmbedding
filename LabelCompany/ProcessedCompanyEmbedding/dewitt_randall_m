dakota state fair huron sd mitchell carnegie historical society mitchell sd       reviews refreshing wwii perspectives with individuality and personalityverified purchaserwow this is fantastic and easy to read my partner and i enjoy wwii movies documentaries and even cinema revolving around wwii i find it can sometimes turn pretty dry and hard to feel human about but this book blows me away to have a glimpse into so many individual mens perspectives and hear the way they have told their stories to randall make this a really impressive little goldmine for any war buffeach story is like sitting at your father or grandfathers knee while he tells you a story about his time in the war each story has a voice of its own that leaves you feeling touched by that one persons adventure some of them seem like they arrived in the nick of time some made impacts in ways you dont learn about in school or see in films it was super refreshing to hear each mans report with the feeling that how you read it is exactly how he would tell you sitting down and sharing a cup of coffee overit would also be a great companion novel to have any students read alongside their history books to actually get the feeling and weight of being drafted going to serve how a solitary man felt in the big movement that was a war its an amazing feeling to be able to read these stories and feel the weight that was placed on the men called to acta read i would highly recommend this for anyone and its at a reading level that is crisp clean and refreshing without stripping the individuality and personality from each mans tale i can read several chapters at a time or just read one and ruminate on the humanity and clarity of vision it presentsvery well done and thoughtful as well i loved itverified purchaserthese individual stories are extremely interesting to read the sacrifices the wwii veterans made are noteworthy and should be seen and understood by everyone we would not enjoy the freedoms we have without them and their service to this nation each man tells his story and what he went through in his own words these men need to be honoredand remembered for what they did a great readverified purchaserthis is an awesome book to read i love history especially if the story is about the wars fought by the us citizens and about people from our local territory   just for fun
