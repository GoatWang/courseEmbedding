important information   a note about risk the fund invests primarily in us and global small midsized and microcap stocks which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than large cap company stocks  the value of the underlying funds investments and the net asset values of the shares of both the fund and the underlying funds will fluctuate in response to various market and economic factors related to equity markets as well as the financial condition and prospects of issuers in which the underlying funds invest  investments in small midsized and microcap company stocks typically involve greater risk particularly in the short term than those in larger more established companies  investments in either growth or value stocks may shift in and out of favor for long periods of time depending on market and economic conditions  investing internationally involves risks not associated with investing solely in the united states such as currency fluctuation political risk differences in accounting and the limited availability of information  these risks can be greater in the case of emerging country securities  the fund is subject to the risks associated with derivatives which may be different from and greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other investments  these factors can affect fund performance   performance data quoted is historical past performance is not indicative of future results current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted the investment return and principal value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate so that shares on any given day or when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost to obtain performance data current to the most recent quarterend go to quarter ending
