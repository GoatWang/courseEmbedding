general » product funnel for nonprofits today’s comment came from a busy professional and an entrepreneur last week i attended your it’s a snap presentation at the nctechgood conference  it was very good but i could not see how to convert the product funnel strategy to my sidejob or even a nonprofit organization   after all they don’t sell a product or service  their company just offers “good works” and my donors just donate money because it’s the right thing to do well – all companies are in the business to make money profits and nonprofits alike and if you make it “good business” to do business with you you will attract more business ie donors who also like to do “good work” the key is “understanding your client’s business” and what will help their business thrive  because when their business thrives they will donate more product funnel example for a fundraising based operation goal is to attract new donors as well as entice current donors to not only continue to donate but increase their amounts one thing that all companies have in common they are in the business to make money one thing that most individuals have in common they want more time for the things that they love use those two facts to build a product funnel that entices people to continue to move down your product funnel list   donate this amount – you will receive coupons to purchase products and services from donors’ company ——————— donate this amount – receive gift certificates for hobbies products and services from donor’s company ———————— donate this amount – invitation to a gala event with celebrities hold this event at one of your donor’s business —————————– donate this amount – and get  family tickets to disney fantasy cruise line or whatever cruise line is a donor the above example isn’t meant to perfectly fit your business model  it just illustrates the concept  in the above example you are providing your donors additional more effective marketing opportunities  this means that their “donation bucks” are also working as their marketing dollars above and beyond their name as sponsors in the front of back pages  it allows their target market to actually get a taste of their business and hopefully continue to buy from them make better use of these two facts clientsdonors have to spend marketing dollars to make dollars people do business with people they know like and trust therefore provide more opportunities for the “right public” to get to know more about your donors and their businesses  learn about your donor’s “target client” and create an effective marketing strategy for that donor  some examples are below provide bundles to entice them to go further down the list such as full page advertorial strictly on the donor’s business you distribute this article to all your magazines ezines websites social media pages blogsites including affiliated partner sites – that go out to your donor’s target clientsmarket they also receive the files for their own distribution  each advertorial includes links coupons and ways to contact the donor’s business an advertorial is an advertisement in the form of editorial content the term “advertorial” is a blend of the words “advertisement” and “editorial”    minute professional video interview on the donor’s business you distribute this article to all your magazines ezines websites social media pages blogsites tv stations including affiliated partner sites – that go out to your donor’s target clientsmarket they also receive the files for their own distribution each advertorial includes links coupons and ways to contact the donor’s business you arrange to have your donor on a tv or radio program that is specifically for their target market this could be an interview a guest spot an infomercial or whatever best fits your donor’s demographic place a billboard for their company at a location of their choice you will have your logo on it to sponsor them contract that x number of your staff members will post positive comments on the donor’s websitesocial media pages for a total of  posts a week for  months contract that x number of your staff members will do a video testimonial for your donor’s business   create a networking event for your donors to meet and do business together officially introduce them to each other and make it easy for them to do business together  have these events at one of your donor’s facilities     once again – these examples may not fit your business model  but the idea is to design a product funnel strategy that will help your donors do better business  when your donor’s business thrives their donation amounts will increase and therefore you will thrive   let’s talk more about this  schedule an appointment here    indicates

types red wines color runs the gamut from dark pink to ink common flavors everything red everything dark dark fruits dark berries leather tobacco coffee cocoa warm spices black pepper — you get the idea darker grape varieties are often used for making red wines but it’s the amount of contact with the skin of the grape that truly determines color more contact with the skin darker wine skin contact also imparts a kaleidoscope of possible flavors and textures contributing to body and complexity extra credit tannins those sometimes bitter or astringent notes often very pleasant in wellbalanced wines come from grape skins you won’t find tannins in a white wine try these el terrano tempranillo dark fruit aromas loads of blackberry and currant flavors wild herbs in the
