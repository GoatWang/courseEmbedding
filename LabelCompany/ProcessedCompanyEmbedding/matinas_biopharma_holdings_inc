overview  matinas biopharma holdings inc mtnb mtnb nyse american view investor info home about us overview growing antimicrobial resistance is a global public health threat health organizations around the world have sounded the alarm and are calling for action in fact one recent analysis of this impending epidemic has indicated that drug resistant infections often called “superbugs” will kill an extra ten  million people a year worldwide – more than currently die from cancer – by  unless action is taken this same analysis projected associated costs to spiral to over  trillion dollars the combination of these multidrug resistant infections coupled with the todate unavoidable toxicity of many available drugs has rendered many current therapies obsolete matinas biopharma founded in  is a publicly traded clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to transform the way potent medicines are delivered and administered in order to provide physicians and patients with more tolerable safer effective and powerful therapeutic options in the battle against these superbugs using its proprietary lipidcrystal nanoparticle delivery technology matinas biopharma is able to provide three critical and unique benefits  oral administration and bioavailability of medicines which today are only able to be delivered intravenously  multiorgan protection from otherwise highly toxic compounds in a stable solid particle  targeted delivery directly to sites of infection andor inflammation with the potential to achieve rapid tissue penetration days ahead of what is available with injected drugs each of these benefits has been repeatedly demonstrated in a robust preclinical data package this disruptive potentially gamechanging technology seals treatment drug in a soybased lipid bilayer sheet which rolls into a spiral structure called a “cochleate” with no internal aqueous space the end product is a stable can be boiled in detergent solid nanoparticle once swallowed the cochleate passes naturally through the walls of the intestinal tract after being absorbed scavenger immune cells that ingest foreign particles such as macrophages engulf the cochleate once engulfed by the macrophage the cochleate enters the cytoplasm an environment of lowcalcium concentration inside the cell the cochleates have been designed to unroll in intracellular lowcalcium environments and purposefully release the drug on the inside of the macrophage protecting the body from the toxic drug in infected individuals macrophages then follow a signalmolecule trail through the lymphatic vessels directly to the site of infection and deliver the drug precisely where it is needed the company’s lead drug candidates are being developed in collaboration with the national institutes of health’s nih’s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid which have been an integral part of all preclinical and clinical work conducted to date and provide independent scientific validation of the potential for this platform mat an orallyadministered encochleated formulation of amphotericin b is set to commence a phase a study funded and led by the niaid in patients with refractory mucocutaneous candidiasis in  with data expected in  also in  matinas biopharma plans to file an investigational new drug application ind for mat an encochleated formulation of amikacin a broad spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat gram negative bacterial infections on top of the improved clinical profile made possible by this technology in assessing the unique opportunity of matinas biopharma one must also consider the associated health economic impact as a result of delivering potent medicines using cochleates with the potential of successfully transitioning the standard of care from the ivadministration of drugs to orally available medications something that has proved quite challenging to many antiinfective companies on top of improved safety and efficacy there are enormous savings to be achieved through reduced hospital stays and the reduction or elimination of the need for frequent blood tests the improvement in the quality of life for patients many of whom are immunocompromised and require long term care by providing the availability of oral drug therapy in the comfort of one’s home is another reason why matinas biophama has the potential to have a transformational impact on the future of drug delivery for numerous medicines beyond these lead clinical programs promising preclinical and phase i data combined with the broad applicability of this delivery platform indicates potential success in reformulating many drugs to take advantage of the oral bioavailability improved safety and targeted delivery made possible using cochleates work has being conducted with antivirals ability to attack reservoirs antiinflammatories no lesions in preclinical animal studies and vaccines significant improvement on traditional flu vaccines and the company has the potential eradication of diseases like hiv tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in its sights unlike many binary biotech product plays there seems to be no shortage of “what’s

tolerated however both the clinical and mycological responses for mat did not meet the company’s expectations and were below that of fluconazole the guideline recommended therapy for the treatment of vvc this completed proofofconcept phase  study of mat was a multicenter randomized trial with the primary objective to evaluate the safety of two orally administered doses  mg and  mg of mat compared to  mg of fluconazole in  women in the safety population secondary efficacy objectives were to assess the clinical cure rate and the mycological eradication rate of oral camb at the test of cure visit
