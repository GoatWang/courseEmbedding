hospital and unfortunately did not have the option of who would be my anesthesiologist i got charged thousands of dollars which i have been paying off at  every  days as directed by these vultures the payments are automatically deducted from my bank account yet every couple of months i get harassed by debt collectors for non payment i just received another notice dated  but they received my payment on the rd i hope that whoever has to have surgery at jupiter hospital demands another company instead of these terrible uncaring money hungry people ps i called the office several times explaining the financial hardship this has placed on my family but they dont care and would not even try to help us they just kept threatening that they would send my account to collections and destroy my credit this from people in the health field i doubt anyone will contact me to apologize for the stress and burdens they have added to our lives bethyour reviewrating your review hereyou must be logged in to
