thanks effie good morning and thank you for joining us on todays call we are pleased that you are with us to discuss our third quarter  performance today we will start with a review of our third quarter results and update on our growth strategy and then the outlook for the remainder of fiscal  then ill turn the call over to brian dambrosia our chief financial officer who will provide additional details on our financial results despite a difficult operating environment the return of winter weather late in the third quarter combined with our effective cost control and solid integration of recent acquisitions allowed us to achieve third quarter earnings at the midpoint of our guidance fiscal yeartodate weve been able to capitalize on this challenging market and accelerate our acquisition and greenfield activity with the opening of  net new stores and the pending acquisition of  additional carx locations combined these acquisitions represent  million in expected annualized sales and  sales growth these acquisitions not only build a strong foundation for future profitability but have also allowed us to add to our store footprint in new southern markets it is our ability to accelerate acquisition growth particularly in tough years for the industry in our geographies that allows monro to guide to flat earnings per share for the year despite negative comparable store sales underscoring the strength of our business model turning to our third quarter results sales increased  to  million comparable store sales increased  with sequential improvement monthtomonth comps in october declined  and improved to negative  in november and as mild weather gave way to snow in december comparable store sales for the month in december increased by  when adjusted for one additional selling day in the month as christmas shifted into our fiscal fourth quarter traffic for the quarter increased  driven by a strong december but with flat traffic in october and november winter weather in december also unlocked pentup demand for tires with comparable store tire sales in the third quarter increasing  led by unit growth particularly in december when units increased approximately  larger ticket and discretionary service category such as brakes alignments and frontend shocks remained under pressure but showed meaningful improvement from prior quarters general maintenance was flat for the quarter from a geographic perspective our southern markets continue to outperform in the months of october and november but with the late arrival of winter weather our northern markets significantly outperformed in the month of december as we enter the fourth quarter weve seen a return to the milder temperatures which have once again impacted our topline particularly as we lap our most difficult comp of the previous year quartertodate comparable store sales adjusted for one less selling day in the quarter are negative  compared to an increase of  in the same period last year that is driven primarily by a decrease in tire units which more than offset positive comps in the brake category also sales in the first week of fiscal february were up  we expect comps to improve as we move through the fourth quarter as comparison significantly ease last years february and march combined comparable store sales were negative  turning now to gross margin as previously guided to third quarter gross margin declined by  basis points versus the prior year due to the impact of fiscal  acquisitions including the newly acquired tire wholesale business gross margin was also impacted by higher tire sales which carry a lower margin than our service category however on a comparable store basis gross margin was flat yearoveryear due to lower material cost primarily related to tires and leverage on fixed expenses as expected the decline in gross margin was more than offset by  basis points of leverage on sga on a comparable store basis when excluding due diligence cost third quarter total operating expenses increased less than  yearoveryear a result of our effective cost control now id like to provide a brief update on our digital initiatives we continue to see strong increases in our online appointments as well as improved collection and use of customer email feedback and reviews we are pleased to report that customer reviews collected in the third quarter continue to post a  approval rating with a total customer satisfaction score of  out of  results we are very proud of we continue to develop and implement improvements to our customer experience both online and instore through enhanced tools and training for our store employees turning now to our growth strategy the integration of our fiscal  acquisition is progressing in line with our plan as previously announced the third quarter included results from the clark tire acquisition a store chain of retail and commercial tire and service location and a retread plant in western north carolina as a reminder the transaction was completed in midseptember and also includes four wholesale tire centers that continue to operate under the tires now brand name weve been very pleased with the results from clark tire thus far and continue to expect the transaction will add approximately  million in annualized sales representing a sales mix of  retail and commercial and  wholesale we also continue to see solid results from the acquisition of mcgee auto service  tires a chain of  retail and commercial locations and a retread facility in florida which we completed in the first quarter mcgee remains on plan to deliver  million in annualized sales representing a sales mix of  service and  tires as a reminder these acquisitions are strategically significant because they expand our retail and commercial business by  stores and  million in sales in the key markets of florida and north carolina as well as add  million in tire wholesale business which combined increases both our scale and market share they increase our tire unit purchases by approximately  expanding our tire assortment and strengthening our purchasing power as we previously stated a  decrease in costpertire is nearly  million in annual cost savings they also allow us to directly distribute tires to approximately  of our stores or roughly  of our chain strengthening our position as an independent dealer and reducing our reliance on distributors thereby allowing us to maximize profitability while creating new organic growth opportunities in the wholesale business and they expand our acquisition opportunities to include competitors with integrated retail commercial and wholesale operations our strategy with respect to our commercial and wholesale operations in the near term is to integrate strengthen and grow them in their respective markets longer term we will evaluate how we can further leverage them across the other  states and distribution centers we operate in we believe these acquisitions will continue to strengthen our competitiveness in the market while providing another valuable avenue of growth over the next several years im also pleased to announce today that weve signed a definitive agreement to acquire  stores from a carx franchisee which includes  location in illinois and three locations in iowa these stores are expected to generate  million in annualized sales representing a sales mix of  service and  tires the stores will continue to operate under the carx banner and the transaction is expected to close this coming march fiscal yeartodate acquisitions completed and announced are expected to add approximately  million in annualized sales and represent  sales growth as weve recently discussed we believe the consumer remains under pressure with stagnant wage growth increasing rents and resets on healthcare deductible and increasing premiums impacting their spending this is adding to the choppiness of the market which is reflected in our recent topline results however it is this challenging market which has helped us accelerate our acquisition activities at present we continue to have more than  ndas signed each of them representing between  stores and  stores within existing markets looking ahead we expect the current operating environment will continue to create favorable accretive acquisition opportunities weve also continued to make progress on our goal of opening  to  greenfield locations in fiscal  in the third quarter we opened nine stores bringing our total to  new greenfield locations fiscal year todate we expect to open five additional stores in the fourth quarter we have slowed the pace of greenfield activity in the fourth quarter given the integration work we currently have underway with our  acquisition as a reminder greenfield stores for us include acquisitions of one to four stores these store additions help drive scale on a local level by allowing us to increase store density in existing markets at very attractive costs we will continue to capitalize on these opportunities into fiscal  now lets turn to our outlook in light of weak comparable store sales in january over a strong comp last year we have taken a cautious approach to our fourth quarter guidance we expect fourth quarter comparable store sales to be in the range of a decline of  to  versus an increase of  basis points last year we expect comparable store sales to improve as we lap easier comparison for the remainder of the quarter as a reminder comparable store sales combined for february and march of last year were negative  the low end of our comp guidance assumes that we recover onehalf of this decline while the high end assumes we recover the full  decline as is always the case this time of year winter weather and snow will be a major driver based on this comp guidance and contributions from our recent and announced acquisitions we anticipate total sales in the fourth quarter to be in the range of  million to  million further we expect fourth quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of  to  reflecting slight dilution from our fiscal  acquisition this compares to earnings per share of  in the fourth quarter of last year based upon our updated fourth quarter guidance we are lowering our expectations for fiscal  comparable store sales to a decline of  to a decline of  compared to our previous guidance which called for a decline of  to  we expect fiscal  total sales to be in the range of  billion to  billion we have also updated our fiscal  earnings guidance to  to  per share compared to our previous range of  to  per share to reflect the lower comparable store sales and slight dilution from our recent acquisitions in the fourth quarter this guidance is based on  million diluted weighted average shares outstanding the midpoint of the fullyear earnings guidance represents an operating margin of  and ebitda of approximately  million as i discussed with you on our last call and as you saw this quarter the commercial and wholesale businesses we acquired in fiscal  operate at a lower gross margin than our retail business however they also require a lower level of sga expenses therefore we continue to expect that this change in our sales mix will reduce gross margins by approximately  basis points and be offset by a similar reduction in sga expenses as a percentage of sales this was the case during the quarter and we expect to continue to see this trend until we begin to anniversary these acquisitions next year said another way our base business operates at about  to  gross margin and in the fiscal  acquisitions weve added commercial and wholesale business which operate around a  gross margin with commercial and wholesale at about  of overall sales that  difference in gross margin will result in a basispoint decrease in our overall gross margin however that will be offset by lower sga to generate those sales minimizing the impact on operating margin in terms of earnings going forward we expect the  million of retail and commercial annualized sales from our fiscal  acquisition to contribute similarly to prior acquisitions we expect the acquired wholesale business to contribute ebitda between  million and  million including improvements in tire costs and distribution efficiencies importantly our outlook for the industry remains positive and we expect to continue to strengthen going forward vehicles  years old and older continue to account for  of our traffic in line with the previous quarter and up from  last year these vehicles produce average ticket similar to our overall average demonstrating that customers continue to invest in and maintain their vehicles even as they advance in age the other significant driver is that total vehicles in operation are expected to grow  by  with vehicles in our sweet spot of six years old and older representing the majority of the growth at the same time the number of service base is expected to continue with slow steady decline these trends should represent meaningful tailwind to our comparable store sales over the next several years before i hand the call over to brian i would like to provide commentary on some of the trends we expect to see in fiscal  first we expect strong contributions from our fiscal  acquisition which represent approximately  annualized sales growth we believe comparable store sales will benefit from easier comparisons particularly in the first half of fiscal  we also expect to sign a new oil supply agreement in the first half of fiscal  resulting in annualized sales of  million to  million – annualized savings of  million to  million we believe our purchasing power and cost competitiveness will continue to strengthen particularly with respect to tires based on the  increase in annual tire unit purchases we realized from our recent acquisitions however this benefit may be offset by upcoming price increases from tire manufacturers to give you some detail recent increases in raw materials have led many tire manufacturers to announce price increases in the midsingle digits beginning with february  orders however its worth noting that not every manufacturer has announced the price increase and some manufacturers are offsetting these price increases with additional volume rebate we expect the overall supply of tires will continue to increase making the market more competitive given our increasing scale we believe we are in a strong position to manage these higher costs but its still too early to provide specific guidance and lastly fiscal  is a week year we estimate that this will benefit comparable store sales by approximately  and earnings per share by approximately  before i conclude i want to briefly address questions i received regarding potential new government policy changes quite simply we dont know what the impact of these changes will have on monro until we see the exact details in governments plans i can tell you that a reduction in the corporate tax rate would be a significant benefit given that our effective tax rate is around  on  million of pretax income as far as possible border adjustments or taxes we import about twothirds of our parts and a little more than onethird of our tire units these import tires are primarily at the entry level and are lower cost relative to branded tires as youve seen we continue to drive significant scale across our business which gives us more flexibility in our supply chain putting us in an enviable position – an enviable competitive position to manage through any potential cost pressures having said that we do hope that there are adults in the room hearing these policy discussions as they may be far reaching impacting the majority of us companies across multiple industries not to mention significant price increases to us consumers our investors should also take comfort in the fact that any additional pressure on our industry whether from tire cost increases changes in import policy or a continued consumer pressure will create additional acquisition opportunities over time which will only strengthen our competitive advantages to conclude i would like to thank our entire team for their solid execution this quarter we greatly appreciate all of their work now id like to hand the call over to brian dambrosia for a review of our financial results brian brian j dambrosia  monro muffler brake inc thanks john sales for the quarter increased  and  million new stores defined as stores opened or acquired after march   added  million including sales of  million from fiscal  and  acquisitions comparable store sales increased  partially offsetting this was a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately  million there were  selling days in the current quarter and  in the prior year third quarter adjusted for days comparable store sales increased  yeartodate sales increased  million and  new stores contributed  million of the increase including  million from fiscal  and  acquisitions largely offsetting this was a decrease in comparable store sales of  additionally there was a decrease in sales from closed doors of approximately  million in a limited number of transactions for the delivery of tires to national account customers we received a delivery commission historically we recorded these as a gross transaction in sales and cost of sales netting to the amount of delivery commission in gross profit we believe that net accounting is more appropriate for these transactions therefore beginning in fiscal  these transactions will be recorded on the sales line at the amount of the delivery commission the impact of the adjustments which lowered sales and cost of sales by equal amounts was  million and  million for the quarter and  months ended december  respectively these adjustments were not material to the comparable periods of the prior year or to previously disclosed comparable store sales percentages there were  selling days for the first  months of this fiscal year and  last fiscal year adjusted for days comparable store sales decreased  at december   the company had  companyoperated stores and  franchise locations as compared with  companyoperated stores and  franchise locations at december   during the quarter ended december  we added  companyoperated stores and closed  including  damaged locations expected to reopen in the fourth quarter yeartodate we added  companyoperated stores including one purchase from an existing franchisee and closed  stores additionally two franchise locations have closed and we purchased one location from an existing franchisee as a companyoperated store gross profit for the quarter ended december  was  million or  of sales as compared with  million or  of sales for the quarter ended december  the decrease in gross margin for the quarter was primarily due to the fiscal  acquisitions which have a higher material cost of sales than the retail business on a consolidated basis labor cost decreased slightly as a percentage of sales due to the impact of positive comparable store sales distribution and occupancy cost decreased moderately as a percentage of sales as we gain leverage on these largely fixed cost over higher overall sales on a comparable store basis gross margin for the quarter ended december  remain flat with the prior quarter as lower product cost particularly tires offset a shift in mix from higher margin service categories to the lower margin tire category gross profit for the nine months ended december  was  million or  of sales as compared with  million or  of sales for the nine months ended december  the yeartodate decrease in gross margin was largely due to the fiscal  acquisitions as described for the quarter additionally labor costs increased slightly and distribution and occupancy costs decreased slightly as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year on a comparable store basis gross margin for the nine months ended december  remain flat with the same period in the prior year at  of sales operating expenses for the quarter ended december  increased  million and over  million or  of sales as compared with  million or  of sales for the quarter ended december  primarily due to increased expenses for new stores partially offset by reduced due diligence costs on a comparable store basis and excluding due diligence costs total operating expense dollars in the quarter ended december  increased less than  from the prioryear period we believe that this demonstrates the effectiveness of our strong cost control in a period of soft sales for the nine months ended december  operating expenses increased by  million to  million or  of sales as compared with  million and  of sales for the prior period the dollar increase primarily relates to increased expenses for new stores partially offset by reduced due diligence costs operating income for the quarter ending december  of  million increased by  as compared to operating income of approximately  million for the quarter ended december  an increase as a percentage of sales from  to  operating income for the nine months ended december  of approximately  million increased by  as compared to operating income of approximately  million for the nine months ended december  and decreased as a percentage of sales from  to  net interest expense for the quarter ended december  increased  million as compared to the same period last year which increased from  to  as a percentage of sales the weightedaverage debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal  increased by approximately  million as compared to the third quarter of last year this increase is due to an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility as well as an increase in capital lease debt recorded in connection with the fiscal  and fiscal  acquisitions the weightedaverage interest rate increased by approximately  basis points as compared to the third quarter of the prior year for the nine months ended december  net interest expense increased by  million as compared to the same period in the prior year and increased from  to  as a percentage of sales for the same period weightedaverage debt increased by approximately  million and the weightedaverage interest rate increased by approximately  basis points as compared to the same period in the prior year the effective tax rate was  of pretax income for the quarter ended december  and  for the quarter ended december  the effective tax rate for the nine months ended december  and december  was  and  respectively of pretax income net income for the current quarter of  million increased  from net income for the quarter ended december  earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter ended december  of  increased  as compared to last years  for the nine months ended december  net income of  million decreased  and diluted earnings per share decreased  from  to  our balance sheet continues to be strong our current ratio at  is comparable to last years third quarter and to yearend fiscal  inventory turns at december  improved modestly as compared to yearend and third quarter of last year in the first nine months of this year we generated approximately  million of cash flow from operating activities and increased our debt under our revolver by approximately  million capital lease and financing obligations increased  million due primarily to the accounting for our fiscal  and  acquisitions at the end of the third quarter debt consisted of  million of outstanding revolver debt and  million of capital leases and financing obligations as a result of the fiscal  borrowings our debttocapital ratio including capital leases increased to  at december  from  at march  without capital and financing leases our debttocapital ratio was  at the end of december  and  at march  under our revolving credit facility we have  million that is committed through january  additionally we have  million accordion feature included in the revolving credit agreement we are currently borrowing at libor plus  basis points and have approximately  million of availability not counting the accordion we are fully compliant with all of our debt covenants and have plenty of room under our financial covenants to add additional debt for acquisitions without any issues all of this as well as the flexibility built into our debt agreement allows us to take advantage of more and larger acquisitions and makes it easy for us to get acquisitions done quickly during the first nine months of this year we spent approximately  million on capex approximately  million in the first quarter and  million in each of the second and third quarters and  million on acquisitions which also includes the small one to four store deals depreciation and amortization totaled approximately  million and we received  million from the exercise of stock options we paid about  million in dividends this concludes my formal remarks on the financial statements with that i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you well go first to bret jordan of jefferies david l kelley  jefferies llc hey good afternoon guys its david kelley in for bret this morning just wondering if you could provide some quick commentary on regional performance delta in january and february maybe what youre seeing in northern versus southern markets and if youve seen any change from december to january in some of your southern stores thatll be great john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure in january and february the southern markets continue to outperform obviously when you look at our january and february of last year we sold a lot of tires because we finally – last year we got a little bit of winter weather in january so thats really skewing the result i think overall like we said the south was flat for the quarter in the third quarter and that is with some impact early in that quarter in october from hurricane matthew which impacted those stores primarily so for january and february i think those trends are continuing the south is continuing to outperform david l kelley  jefferies llc okay great thanks and just a quick followup on that you mentioned tires any significant performance shifts in other specific categories just looking again kind of end of year or two what were seeing in january yeartodate john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc yeah sure well and i called out during my prepared remarks that the brake category quartertodate in these first five weeks is positive i think its plus  on a positive last year and that certainly is a much better run rate than what we saw earlier this fiscal year david l kelley  jefferies llc okay great perfect and then one more and ill pass it along any color on i guess some of the multiples youre seeing in the acquisition market any significant changes there either up or down that would be great as well john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc no in the  to  stores that weve talked about here where we have more than  ndas still were not seeing any changes in the multiples what i will say is that we do buyoff of trailing ebitda and in a year like this trailing ebitda is pressured so prices overall are reflecting that and getting better david l kelley  jefferies llc all right thank you appreciate the commentary john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure thank you operator well move next to rick nelson of stephens rick nelson  stephens inc thanks good morning john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc good morning rick nelson  stephens inc id like to followup on guidance for the fourth quarter which implies ebitda margin down about  basis points were calculating if you could tell us what the drivers are to that john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc yeah its simply deleveraged from the sales adjustment the impact in the change in our guidance reflects the fact that we had anticipated a positive comp in the fourth quarter here and given the start in january we needed to revise that so its just basically that impact if you take that thats basically a  comp store change comp store sales change on the lowend and the highend and if you look at that versus the sort of  for every  comp for the year youll basically get  or  in that  rick nelson  stephens inc got it thanks for that color john also id like to ask you about these tire price increases so you said some of the manufacturers are trying to put through midsingle digit growth do you think those types of increases do they stick and if you could talk about your ability to pass those on to the consumer john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure they certainly stick a lot less with the company thats growing their tire unit purchases by  like us and the other thing is well see what happens to commodities going forward the increases in commodities kind of accelerated late in the calendar year so well see if that continues in terms of passing them along i think theres two things i would say is first we will certainly try to pass any increases that were seeing along and i would expect competitors particularly smaller competitors to need to do that given the choppy and more difficult operating environment so what were looking for is if our costs go up less than theirs and you try to pass it along maybe we get some help from the margin side but well have to see in the past if we were putting through price increases we might be able to pass half of that along historically or half of the announced increases along and if we do better on our increases well look to protect first our gross profit in terms of dollars per tire and then well look to see if we can manage cost to get some benefit there but it will be a pressure that certainly wasnt there when we had this call in october rick nelson  stephens inc i think back in october you had talked about a  per unit cost advantage per tire john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc right i mean in this case im not issuing guidance or maybe that might be more or like the best result as opposed to the base result going forward i dont know well certainly update at the end when we issue guidance for fiscal  and were working hard to make sure that our increase in unit purchases is going to payoff for us and our stockholders rick nelson  stephens inc all right great hey thanks a lot and good luck john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc thank you operator up next from oppenheimer well hear from brian nagel david bellinger  oppenheimer  co inc hi this is david bellinger on for brian i have a few quick questions so first on the january accounts being down about  how should we interpret that that bascially sales slowdown did a strong december shift sales at a january and basically how meaningful is january in terms of q are tires or other categories more pronounced versus other quarters john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc yeah so sure i think the short story on january is that we were up against a big comp in the prior year driven by some recovery of sales last year from a weak third quarter and this year we certainly had a big spike in december and came in and saw some warmer weather throughout our markets in january we havent had much snow and so i think running up against the high conflict we had last year its just – we gave most of that back so i think whats important as we pointed out is the february and march comparisons get much more favorable february has started out in the first week at plus  and so i expect that our trends should improve as the quarter goes forward i talked about the brake category being positive on positive sales last year and i would expect we have some tire unit opportunity particularly with some snow as the quarter moves on here david bellinger  oppenheimer  co inc okay and then just followingup on that so clearly a normalized winter ahead of – no real help to december comps just when you stacked it up to past winters with the colder temperatures i know its tough to quantify but in your opinion could that december and winter period been harsh enough to propel and sort of a longer tail for auto services demand into the coming spring and summer months ahead john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc well i think our comps were weak at the beginning of this fiscal year so weve at least gotten some winter weather during this winter not enough of it certainly it would have been great had it come in november as well because that is the biggest tire selling month of the year so before i make predictions about next year i would hope that we continue to see some cold weather and some snow which gets plows out on the road and creates potholes that really helps lay the groundwork for a strong first half of the year i think regardless im optimistic about the first half of the year next year given the very favorable comparisons that well be up against david bellinger  oppenheimer  co inc got it i appreciate you taking my questions thanks john john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure operator well go next to matt fassler of goldman sachs matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co hello and good morning too i want to first revisit the question that rick asked about ebit margin implied ebit margin in the fourth quarter were just trying to process some of the guidance that you gave in interest and taxes and such but it looks like youve got ebit margin implied down about as much as you had it down in the first and second quarters during which period the comps were down substantially more than youre guiding down in q in the march quarter so is there – and i know when you spoke about the acquisitions that have kind of different pl geography you suggested that they kind of have a similar operating margin end game so is there anything else that could be pressuring the operating margin relative to sales compared to the trends that we saw earlier in the year john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc yeah i think there are a couple of things first of all the fourth quarter is the lowest sales quarter and thats a piece of it we – and the acquisitions are dilutive it will be much more dilutive than the first two quarters we purchased mcgee and – during the first quarter and then we purchased the much larger clark business in this – where the results came in to our results for the first time in the third quarter so i think if you look at those those really bridge the gap matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co and as you think about the seasonality of the tire business relative to  is obviously where the acquisitions are tilted relative to the rest of the business is it more weighted away from q john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc im sorry the matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co is the seasonality of the tire business even more extreme than the rest of the business whether that works against q profitability john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc no i mean in terms of the tire business we said that the biggest driver of the tire business within our markets is winter weather particularly as you hit q and q matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co yeah john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc q i view that as the sort of peak of seasonality related to that business with q sort of close behind there so yes if we get more snow i expect that to be a positive for the remainder of the quarter here matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co got it second question just want to make sure i understand the impact of the day shift i guess where the christmas holiday fell so it sounds like it was included in that reported comp though you did disclose the comp x the extra day which i guess is about a percentage point lower it sounds like the month that you gave us though were adjusted so in other words the day is out and then i guess one of the reasons there might have been a bigger difference between the total on the comp sales number would that have driven a bigger difference between the total on the comp sales number or is that more the acquisitions that would have done so because it sounds like john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc no its really – yeah its really the acquisitions matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co got it and john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc go ahead matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co and then my final question kind of moving past the extra day stuff which i know can be banal and i think you touched on this john just if you look at some of the government data on tire ppi and cpi that had been favorable for you at least theoretically so where you had a bit of a spread that should have been hopeful on margin whats your expectation for tire margin as commodity costs are to move higher again john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc well i guess it depends on – youre saying if commodity costs move higher i guess i would tell you what we said about the cost increases if that – to the extent that that drives cost increases it will drive lower cost increases for us i would expect because of our large volume and growing volumes and we certainly run the business to maintain our margins so we will certainly look to pass along those increases and maintain our pricing discipline as we have in the past so i guess i dont have any specific guidance around that but like everything that impacts the entire market we ought to see some competitive advantage arise from it matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co understood okay thank you so much i appreciate it john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure operator from consumer edge well go to jamie albertine please go ahead your line is open james j albertine  consumer edge research llc great thanks and good morning everyone just a quick housekeeping item i noticed that your interest expense ticked up a little bit i just want to make sure to ask you how we should think about that going forward  of an elevated interest expense estimate flowing through the model number one number two more strategically however you want to define it but what percentage of your portfolio would you say today is northeast relative to midatlantic and southeast and how quickly will that change over time with respect to acquisitions because it does seem like you always are active in the acquisition market but there are clearly arent any sort of big one or two transaction items that can really shift that percentage quickly so if we were to sit here today and sort of model out the next two or three years whats the percentage today and how will that look like in your opinion in the coming year or two thanks john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure let me take the second question first right now our comp base is a little over  what we call north and a little under  in the south so obviously adding the majority of the acquisitions that we made are in the south so that should probably – that will increase the southern exposure there from our perspective looking out the next couple of years i like the growth in the south thats great but we get so much operating leverage in all of the acquisitions that we complete that i dont want anyone to have the impression that were not interested in doing acquisitions in any of our markets that is a key piece of our strategy but going forward you should expect us to be active all throughout our markets and with a particular interest in the south but not some kind of fundamental preference from this point forward the other point that i would make along with that is when you look at dilution and dilution on the operating margin in the year with big acquisitions the basic approach that we have and part of our strategy or one of the results of our strategy is that we continue to add acquisitions and dilute the operating margin and then bring it back up as we integrate those acquisitions so this year youre seeing that more markedly because were in a year early in these acquisitions in the integration process where theyre dilutive but we have all the sales coming on so that is a dynamic that is something that we will continue to see and i think its not necessarily a good thing but its just a result of what i view as a great strategy that weve been able to execute so i want to make sure that – and that is a particular interest as we look at the fourth quarter here were going to have acquisitions that are dilutive because were adding sales early in the integration process on the interest expense brian will take that brian j dambrosia  monro muffler brake inc yeah so the interest expense is up the big driver of that is just the weightedaverage debt outstanding thats  million higher than it was in the prioryear quarter debt obviously affected by the acquisitions the debt that we incurred for borrowings for payment of the acquisitions and also capital leases that we assumed as part of those acquisitions so that is not too difficult to model in terms of our typical paydowns against future deals will affect the amount that we have outstanding related to that so the interest rate was less of an impact on it only  basis points but we are currently  basis points over libor so any variability in libor will affect our rate going forward james j albertine  consumer edge research llc got it thank you gentlemen for both those answers and just if i may a quick followup on the strategic question john can you provide an update i know in prior calls we talked about how youre fulfilling your stores in the southern part of the country this was the georgia and florida markets from quite a distance can you just give us a little bit of an update as to how youre looking at investments into may be southeastern distribution or how we should think about the impact related to that in the coming quarters from whether its a cogs or sga perspective or a combination thereof that the impact to operating margin ahead of your potential investment in a closer distribution facility thanks john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure youre right we are distributing from a distance to those stores as ive said previously we are taking a look at opportunities for distribution centers somewhere potentially in the florida market and we said we were looking at that in the back half of this fiscal year were doing that and i would – what i dont want to do is get out in front of that if were going to be making an acquisition that might have some redundant warehouse space or availability there so we want to give some time for that and i think what ive said previously is still the case were certainly not maximizing the cost of goods benefits but i still believe that we need to be over  stores for a distribution center down there to payoff and so we will be looking that over the next several months and updating as we issue our guidance for fiscal  james j albertine  consumer edge research llc okay great thanks again and best of luck for the next quarter john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc thank you operator moving on to michael montani of evercore michael montani  evercore isi hey guys thanks for taking the question just wanted to ask if i could on the third quarter can you split out whats in the tire comp of plus  what did you see in terms of price versus units in the quarter john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure units were up  and average ticket was down  and that was michael montani  evercore isi got it john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc mostly – it was mostly trade down some price michael montani  evercore isi okay thank you and then one quick one on fair labor standards act which looks like were able to avert i guess in december is that going to have any ongoing negative headwind because you all would have communicated that or are you able to avoid that potential expense stepup john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc no we did not roll out any changes there michael montani  evercore isi okay john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc we were – we want to see what any final rules are before we go changing pay plans we dont like to change pay plans on people michael montani  evercore isi got it and then i guess the last one was a bit of housekeeping but just can you give us a mix of percentage of revenue by category for the quarter john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure for the combined – for the company brakes was  steering was  tires was  and maintenance was  the difference is exhaust but it should be about  michael montani  evercore isi got it thank you john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc yes operator from keybanc well go next to brett hoselton please go ahead brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc good morning gentlemen john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc good morning brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc could you please comment on your tire mix shift to lower margin tires is that a management strategy or is that simply a result of consumer preference john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc its really consumer preference as weve said in the past what weve done over the last couple years is broaden our assortment and weve done that in part with increased lines of import tires but we broaden that assortment to provide consumers choice good value for them where we are able to make good gross profit dollars per tire and really more than anything its consumer choice brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc and then on the tire pricing front todate you havent seen any impact of tire pricing in the most recent quarter and through january is that a fair statement john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc you mean retail brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc yes yeah well in terms of – tire pricing in terms of the sellin john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc yeah at retail to consumer we havent seen any significant changes really from recent trend in terms of sellin to dealers or to tire dealers in the industry i would expect january sellin there so many manufacturer sells to maybe reflect the fact that that some companies including ours are trying to make sure that they buy ahead of any cost increases that are coming to them brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc okay fair enough thank you john i appreciate it john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure thank you operator moving on to carolina jolly of gabelli a carolina jolly  gabelli  co good morning thanks for taking my call john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc sure a carolina jolly  gabelli  co i know we had spoken about in the past that some of your acquisitions cannibalized some of your revenues is that built into your current comps john w van heel  monro muffler brake inc i think that is the dynamic that we see in specific markets where were buying businesses that – and we really saturate the market certainly it wasnt a huge impact in the past quarter in the past quarter i think what we said is that our business in the winter reacts to snow and that was sort of proven in spades in the quarter a carolina jolly  gabelli  co and then also  robert g gross  monro muffler brake inc yeah this is rob carolina were not going to blame weak comps on facility and grabbing market share making more money in a market its just an edge on but if you add  of the acquisition growth one year and additional  a year before and knows theyre working their way into the system and operating margins its going to have some slight negative drag a carolina jolly  gabelli  co okay thanks robert g gross  monro muffler brake inc but we own our weak comps operator and that does conclude todays questionandanswer session at this time id like to turn the call back over to mr john van heel for closing remarks john w van heel  monro muffler

good morning and thank you for joining us on todays call we are pleased that you are with us to discuss our second quarter fiscal  performance ill start today with a review of our results key initiatives and outlook for fiscal  ill then turn the call over to cathy damico our chief financial officer who will provide additional details on our financial results in the second quarter we delivered on our key objectives of increasing traffic leveraging our scale and supplychain and effectively managing operating expenses while driving strong contributions from our recent acquisitions and maintaining a robust pipeline of new acquisition opportunities our teams strong execution drove positive results on both the top and bottom line sales in the second quarter increased by over  comparable store sales were positive  led by a  increase in traffic and were consistent throughout the quarter earnings per share grew  to a record  the midpoint of our guidance supported by operating margin expansion of  basis points for the first six months of the fiscal year sales have increased by  operating margin expanded  basis points and net income increased by  these results clearly demonstrate that our business model is working we are also pleased that the sales momentum we experienced in the second quarter has strengthened into october with a  increase in comparable store sales month to date and continued positive traffic during the second quarter sales grew across our key categories most notably comparable sales for alignments increased by  tires and exhaust each increased by  and brakes increased by  maintenance services and front end shocks were both flat we are encouraged by the  increase in tire sales in the second quarter led by higher retail tire prices and flat tire units which we believe are indicative of broader trends and reflect that we have customers continuing to delay purchases particularly on large ticket items that said as our results would suggest we are seeing improvement october will mark our sixth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales however i would like to see our  positive comparable store sales trend month to date continue through the third quarter before i consider this an inflection point for consumers the recent sales initiatives we have undertaken to improve our marketing crm and website capabilities are helping to support our field teams highly focused on driving higher store traffic and sales the continued shift in marketing spend to more efficient digital advertising and including through our crm system are driving customers both to our stores and website we have upgraded our desktop and mobile website capabilities with significant improvements to our online appointment and tire search function in addition to these online enhancements we are increasing the collection of customer email addresses allowing us to more effectively communicate and drive higher customer conversion these initiatives are already having a positive impact on our traffic and sales which we expect will build as we move further into the back half of the year now lets turn to gross margin we continued to generate significant gross margin expansion with an increase of  basis points to  in the quarter driven by lower material cost as a percentage of sales increased payroll efficiency and leverage of our distribution and occupancy costs in the second quarter we collected more gross profit dollars for tires than in the same period last year this is significant to our earnings growth given that every  increase in tire gross profit is worth  of earnings per share in a given year which is double the contribution versus a  increase in unit looking ahead we expect that our cost advantage versus competitors will continue to widen as we capitalize on our increasing scale and flexible supply chain while continuing to effectively manage our retail tire prices moving on to expenses total operating expenses as a percent of sales delevered by  basis points in the second quarter driven primarily by higher due diligence costs related to potential acquisitions despite the choppy environment we achieved another quarter of strong profit growth with second quarter operating income up  yearoveryear and operating margin expansion of  basis points to  of sales net income increased  yearoveryear to  million or a record  in earnings per share and included  of expense related to annual director stock option grant our strong sales results in the quarter and yeartodate underscores the flexibility of our business model and demonstrates that regardless of the macro environment we can successfully manage the business to drive strong bottom line results now i would like to discuss our growth strategy continuing our strong acquisition growth during the second quarter we completed the previously announced acquisition of  stores in central new york pennsylvania and massachusetts  of these stores are located in central new york and two are in pennsylvania those stores have been rebranded under the mr tire brand allowing the company to fill in existing markets where we currently operate monro brake  tire location the remaining four stores are located in massachusetts and operate under the monro brake  tire brand these acquisitions increase monros presence in these regions and demonstrate the advantages of monros twobrand strategy these transactions are expected to add approximately  million in annualized sales representing an estimated sales mix of  service and  tires they are expected to be breakeven to slightly accretive to earnings per share in fiscal  as we anticipate that cost synergies will be realized at an accelerated pace due primarily to our ability to leverage the existing distribution in these markets as a reminder in the first quarter we completed the acquisition of the carx brand a chain of  franchise locations operating in  states carx is expected to add approximately  million in ebitda annually and will be slightly accretive to earnings per share in fiscal  in total these transactions completed in the first six months of fiscal  represent approximately  million in annualized sales acquisitions allow us to increase monros total sales and store count and as a result raise our purchasing power with vendors they also allow us to further leverage distribution advertising field management and corporate overhead costs all of which will help drive future operating margin expansion the current operating environment continues to create favorable acquisition opportunities in the shortterm choppy sales trends and higher costs continue to weigh on smaller dealers but importantly the longerterm opportunity is that owners of independent tire dealers are at or near retirement age without an internal succession option when excluding the acquisitions completed year to date in fiscal  we continue to have more than  ndas signed we remain very optimistic by the opportunities to complete additional acquisitions in the second half of the fiscal year now lets turn to the details of our outlook taking into account anticipated sales contribution from our completed  acquisitions the strong performance of our recent acquisitions and positive comparable store sales trend we are narrowing our fiscal  sales guidance to a range of  million to  million this range now assumes comparable store sales of positive  to  compared to our previous guidance of  to  as a reminder we closed  bjs locations in fiscal  which reduces our sales base versus last year but will have minimal impact on earnings turning to our expectations for cost of goods we continue to believe that monros overall tire cost including related warehousing and logistics will be down slightly in fiscal  we expect lower raw material costs increasing competition among manufacturers and our robust supply chain to continue to benefit gross margin while further widening our competitive cost advantage unlike many of our competitors we have already shifted nearly all of our nonbranded tire sourcing to suppliers outside of china minimizing the impact of the chinese tariff furthermore due to the strong performance of our recent acquisitions we now expect  to  in earnings per share contribution from them compared to previous guidance of  to  we remain very encouraged by the opportunities we see to complete additional attractive acquisitions this fiscal year as a result we expect higher due diligence cost in fiscal  compared to last year which is reflected in our earnings guidance based on these assumptions we have narrowed our fiscal  diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of  to  versus our prior guidance of  to  this compares to earnings per share of  in fiscal  an increase of  to  yearoveryear on top of a  increase in the prior two years our fiscal  guidance is based on  million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in short we raised the lower end of our guidance from  to  per share in step with our higher sales expectation and adjusted the high end from  to  per share as a result of higher expected due diligence costs the midpoint of our earnings guidance represents operating margin expansion of  basis points for the fiscal year on top of the  basis point improvement we realized in fiscal  given the lower material costs we anticipate this fiscal year we now expect the comparable store sales increase of approximately  basis points will overcome inflation versus the  to  increase we have historically required with that said let me remind you that every  increase in comparable store sales above that inflation hurdle generates an incremental  in eps turning to the quarter as i previously stated october comparable store sales are up approximately  month to date based on these trends we expect total third quarter comparable store sales to increase  to  versus the prior year period we anticipate total sales for the quarter to be in the range of  million to  million diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of  to  versus  in the prior year period and include higher due diligence cost longterm trends remain favorable for our business with nearly  million vehicles on the road with a record average age of  years old a slowly declining population of service base and consumers choosing do it for me service more frequently importantly during this first six months of the fiscal year vehicles  years old and older accounted for  of our traffic these vehicles produced average tickets similar to our overall average demonstrating that consumers continue to invest in and maintain their vehicles even as they advance in age our key competitive advantages are still in place including our lowcost operations superior customer service and convenience along with our store density and twobrand store strategy our five year plan remains unchanged and it continues to call for on average  annual top line growth including  growth through acquisitions  comps and a  increase from greenfield stores our acquisitions are generally diluted to earnings in the first six months as we overcome due diligence and deal related costs while working through initial inventory and the operational transition of these stores with cost savings and recovery in sales results are generally breakeven to slightly accretive year one and  to  accretive in year two and an additional  to  accretive in year three over a fiveyear period that should improve operating margins by approximately  basis points and deliver an average of  bottom line growth as our results have shown our disciplined acquisition strategy is further strengthening our position in the marketplace we expect it to continue to provide meaningful value to our shareholders for many years to come before i hand the call over to cathy i want to reiterate that i am pleased by our overall execution as we look to deliver our sixth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales with  basis points of operating margin expansion year to date and record profit as we move into the second half of the year i would like to share with you positive trends that we believe will continue to favorably impact our bottom line in fiscal  these include the positive impact to traffic and sales from our heightened operational focus and our turn to digital crm and marketing initiatives higher inflation of  to  which represents a  increase in overall comparable store sales on flat unit volume tire cost of goods that are down slightly versus fiscal  indiscernible prices a yearoveryear benefit from the decline in oil cost net of reduced waste oil credits of approximately  million and significant sales and earnings contributions from our fiscal   and recent  acquisitions and additional acquisitions at attractive valuations before i turn the call over to cathy i would like to thank each of our employees for their continued hard work their consistent execution and superior customer service they deliver on a daily basis is reflected in monros brand strength and financial success they are the reason for monros compelling customer value proposition and im greatly appreciative of their efforts now id like to turn the call over to cathy for a more detailed review of our financial results cathy catherine damico thanks john good morning everyone sales increased  and  million for the quarter new stores which we define as stores opened or acquired after march   added  million including sales of  million from fiscal  and  acquired stores comparable store sales increased  partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately  million largely related to the bjs store closures in fiscal  additionally during the quarter ended september  the company completed the bulk sale of approximately  million of inventory to a indiscernible company as compared to a  million transaction in the second quarter of last year there were  selling days in both the current and prior years second quarters year to date sales increased  million and  new stores contributed  million of the increase including  million from fiscal  and  acquisitions additionally there was a comparable store sales increase of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately  million again largely related to the bjs store closures and there were  selling days for the first six months of this and last fiscal year at september   the company had  companyoperated stores and  franchised locations as compared with  companyoperated stores and one franchised location at september   during the quarter ended september  the company added  companyoperated stores and closed five year to date we added  stores and closed nine gross profit for the quarter ended september  was  million or  of sales as compared with  million or  of sales for the quarter ended september  the increase in gross profit for the quarter ended september  as a percentage of sales is due to several factors first there was a decrease in total material cost including outside purchases primarily related to reduced oil and tire cost distribution and occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year quarter as we gained leverage on these largely fixed costs with higher sales additionally the recording of some new leases under gaap as operating versus capital reduced occupancy cost and increased interest expense labor costs decreased as a percent of sales as compared to the prior year quarter to continued focused cost control gross profit for the six months ended september  was  million or  of sales as compared to  million or  of sales for the six months ended september  the year to date increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is due to similar factors as i described for the quarter material costs declined meaningfully related to decreases in oil and tire costs additionally labor costs as a percentage of sales decreased as compared to the prior year operating expenses for the quarter ended september  increased  million and were  million or  of sales as compared with  million or  of sales for the quarter ended september  the increase as a percent of sales is primarily due to increased due diligence cost and increased management bonus related to improved performance as compared to the prior year quarter for the six months ended september  operating expenses increased by  million to  million or  of sales as compared with  million and  of sales for the prior period this month the increase is primarily due to increased due diligence and management bonus expense as well as a small increase in benefit cost as a percent of sales again as compared to the prior six months operating income for the quarter ended september  of  million increased by  as compared to operating income of approximately  million for the quarter ended september  an increase as a percentage of sales from  to  operating income for the six months ended september  of approximately  million increased by  as compared to operating income of approximately  million for the six months ended september  it also increased as a percentage of sales from  to  net interest expense for the quarter ended september  at  of sales increased  million as compared to the same period last year which was at  of sales weighted average debt outstanding for the second quarter of fiscal  increased by approximately  million as compared to the second quarter of last year the increase is primarily related to an increase in capital lease debt recorded in connection with the fiscal  and  acquisitions the weighted average interest rate also increased by approximately  basis points from the prior year largely due to adding capital leases for the six months ended september  interest expense increased by  million an increase from  to  as a percentage of sales for the same period weighted average debt increased by approximately  million and the weighted average interest rate increased by approximately  basis points again due to an increase in capital lease debt our effective tax rate was  of pretax income for the quarter ended september  and  for the quarter ended september  net income for the current quarter of  million increased to  over the net income for the quarter ended september  earnings per share on a diluted basis of  increased  as compared to last years  for the six months ended september  net income of  million increased  and diluted earnings per share increased  from  to  per share moving on to our balance sheet it continues to be strong our current ratio of  to  is comparable to fiscal  in the first six months of this year we generated approximately  million of cash flow from operating activities and increased our debt under our revolver by approximately  million we used these borrowings and cash flow from operating activities to finance our fiscal  acquisitions which added  stores to date as well as the carx franchise business capital lease and financing obligations increased  million due primarily to our fiscal  and  acquisitions at the end of the second quarter debt consisted of  million of outstanding revolver debt and  million of capital leases and financing obligations as a result of the fiscal  borrowings our debt to capital ratio including capital leases increased to  at september  from  at march  without capital and operating leases our debt to capital ratio is  at the end of september  and  at the end of march  under our revolving credit facility we have  million that is committed through december  additionally we have a  million accordion feature included in the revolving credit agreement we are currently borrowing at libor plus  basis points and we have approximately  million of availability not including the accordion we are fully compliant with all of our debt covenants and have plenty of room under these covenants to add additional debt for acquisitions without any problem all of this as well as the flexibility built into our debt agreement continues to make it easy for us to get acquisitions done quickly additionally we are in the process of negotiating a larger facility to ensure that we can fund more and larger acquisitions going forward during the first six months of this year we spent approximately  million on capex and we concluded approximately  million in the second quarter and  million on acquisitions depreciation and amortization totaled approximately  million divided roughly evenly between q and q and we received  million from the exercise of stock options we paid about  million in dividend inventory is up approximately  million from march  largely due to acquired stores and the purchase of winter tires in anticipation of the demand in the third quarter total inventory turns for the rolling  months ended september  were relatively flat from last years second quarter in units that concludes my formal remarks on the financial statements with that i will turn the call over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well take our first question from bret jordan with jefferies bret jordan on the gross margin some pretty good performance in the quarter was there any contribution from leftover chinese tire inventory that was still turning in there john w van heel no obviously we are turning the tires as we go but what we said is we expect tire cost overall to be slightly down this year so weve really been able to hold those costs in check so no change ph from that bret jordan okay and then the supply chain what markets are you sourcing out of now given the fact that the chinese product is less attractive and maybe could you tell us what the mix of import was versus branded tires in the quarter john w van heel there are other pacific rim countries and they are as we said before some new manufacturer relationship as well as some continuing that have shifted their production outside of china and then the mix is roughly the same this year and last year its right around  bret jordan okay great and then just on segments indiscernible  comp in alignment and it outperforming tires so much and they have ph certain nonalignment fees and what do you make of that is that something that was promoted in the quarter john w van heel yes i think again it relates back to what we said about tire units being flat i think consumers are still deferring larger ticket purchases and in those cases they are making sure and accepting our alignment recommendations more often to keep the tires that they have on their cars going longer and i mean thats where we put an operational focus on that as well because we think that is the case and we are doing a much better job of this than we were doing prior bret jordan okay and then the quarter october to date comp is segment trends in that  roughly the same or is there anything sort of outlying in that current performance john w van heel so traffic is up as i said tires are about plus  i think whereas the ph service is getting better bret jordan okay great thank you operator moving on well go to rick nelson of stephens nicholas zangler this is nick zangler in for rick just hitting on that  october comp thats really strong it looks like to me the strongest number since january of  now it looks like november could be a little bit of a harder month to lap but december kind of looks like from a competitive basis like october so given your guide of  to  what needs to happen in this quarter for you to get to high end of that range and were kind of hearing titbits on a milder winter this quarter or into next year how does that factor in and is that good for you guys bad for you guys just some reflections on that john w van heel i think we have seen a quarter of plus  that we think is the floor we are running plus  right now on higher traffic we have gotten good contributions from our initiatives there and as i look at it november and december really offset themselves so we are really running up against the slightly negative comp over the next couple of months and i think there is significant opportunity to continue at this plus  id like to see that for the remainder of the quarter nicholas zangler great and then just wanted to jump back over to the carx acquisition obviously i would imagine the franchise owners were able to purchase product from monro which has the potential to provide benefits to both monro and the franchise owners given your scale can you talk about any progress you have made with those owners since the acquisition have you been able to improve those franchise operations did they benefit you just what your interaction has been with those owners john w van heel sure things are going well at carx we are looking to use all of the advantages that we have that you just talked about to help improve the businesses of the franchise owners we are bringing opportunities to them as we get those sorted out so theyve been running well but overall thats a  million ebitda opportunity on a  million plus ebitda company so its going well were very pleased with it and we continue to work hard to help these guys improve their business and grow the chain nicholas zangler great and then finally has that served as a potential acquisition pool how are the dynamics what does it look like do you have like a right of first refusal i would imagine the owners would go to you guys first but is there anything contractually thats baked in there john w van heel no there isnt again our objective is to help these guys improve their businesses and grow the chain we think that where they would come to us if they want to sell their business they would have more of an opportunity than perhaps theyve had in the past but were very happy with the franchise model there and were trying to grow that with them nicholas zangler great congratulations on the results positive comps and the good start to q good luck operator and next well hear from tony cristello with bbt capital markets tony cristello one question i wanted to talk a little bit about and obviously you got to be careful in terms of comp trend and where youre forecasting and i know you are running a  in october can you give me the sort of cadence of how the quarter shaped up and then on the sustainability of a positive october what do you typically see heading into november on that john w van heel so the second quarter was plus  in july plus  in august and plus  in september and again in this quarter is a key quarter for tire sales november is a very important month there as we just talked about we were up something like  last september but then had a negative month in december so i think if the consumer – hopefully our traffic initiative which has brought in a bunch of new customers in the second quarter are going to help us sustain that plus  throughout the third quarter here robert g gross yes i think we were up  in november is what we were going to say and we would hope the  is the new norm but one month does not make a trend tony cristello right patience but you hope that the pentup demand flows through robert g gross no we have no patience tony cristello maybe shifting gears a little bit to you expanded into some newer markets in florida and georgia which are very good markets but atypical to monro you dont have a big infrastructure still you dont get the benefits of distribution and im just trying to understand then one im assuming you are getting good sales results but you may not get the full leverage that you would get in those markets how should we think about contribution on a go forward basis as you are backfilling and building out those markets john w van heel in particular florida and georgia youre right we dont have the distribution down there the sales results are good we are happy with that we typically talk about  to  basis points of operating margin improvement that we get from distribution synergies right now we are delivering product down to those markets so our distribution costs are higher so basically right now we are not getting that  to  basis point on distribution and that represents an opportunity we said in the past that we would look at opening a dc when were more like triple digit stores down in those markets and at that point we would spend some money on the dc on a larger store base to get after that distribution synergies tony cristello okay and im assuming that your targeted growth of acquisitions is inclusive of those newer markets are those markets that you feel comfortable enough to continue to maybe add stores via greenfield john w van heel yes we absolutely are adding both greenfield stores and looking at those for acquisitions we have a number of acquisition opportunities in those markets which i view as very positive they are large dense markets and they balance our exposure to more northeast and north central markets so i think its a great opportunity for us tony cristello and how long would it take you to sort of get a dc up and running is that a couple of years venture and therefore maybe you dont get the full efficiencies in those markets for another two three years john w van heel no that would be more like somewhere plus or minus probably a little bit plus  months once we made that decision tony cristello okay great thank you for your time operator next well hear from michael montani with evercore isi michael montani i want to ask about the nda pipeline if i could for a moment there was a comment that you all had made about increasing the credit line and potentially being related to larger sized deals so could there be any in the pipeline now that are larger sized how should we sort of think about that john w van heel the more than  ndas that we talked about are  to  stores within our markets so if we were a bigger company with more opportunities and with respect to larger deals we have always said that anything that makes sense for our company and the shareholder of the company that we would look at but right now i want to make sure that we have the opportunity to take advantage of all the acquisition opportunities that we see we said this was going to be a good year for acquisitions we wanted to have the flexibility to take advantage michael montani great and just to follow up the digital initiatives that you have embarked on sound to be paying off a little bit can you quantify at all if you look at the traffic up  and it sounds like it hasnt gotten any worse than that in october how much of that might be related to those initiatives and also what are oil changes looking like john w van heel so oil changes are up and when you look at the traffic were bringing in a lot of new customers here thats our focus in the field and i view the digital initiatives as supporting that so the big push is all of our guys in the field doing a great job for customers bringing in new customers doing more getting them out happy with our service on a first visit that might be something more like an oil change or a lowercost service and giving them a reason to come back to us so that plus  traffic in the quarter should help pay off in the second quarter should help pay off in the third quarter with consumers coming back and needing more costly repairs that they cant delay anymore michael montani got it just one last housekeeping thing which was if you could share what the mix was this quarter in terms of revenue by category john w van heel sure so for the quarter tires was  steering was  exhaust was  brakes was  and maintenance was  and as always dont hold me to the rounding michael montani sounds good thanks a lot operator operator instructions next well hear from jamie albertine with stifel jamie albertine so first of all congratulations you had a solid quarter the gross margin i think it was already asked about was exceptional and it looks like what youre doing to drive the comp leverage point lower is benefiting yourselves now as comp appears to be a bit down to accelerating but really if i may i know you have asked its been asked a bunch of different ways i want to drill on the comp a little bit is it too early given where we are in october i know i saw bills ph highlight last weekend there was some snowfall i dont know if upstate new york is different but is it too early to make a call on whether folks are getting into snow tires and replacing what youve told us in the past are heavily used bald deferred tire purchases robert g gross this is rob its too early i mean we said tires in october are doing the same thing they did in q and i dont think people are thinking about buying some tires in july august or september so we continue to run flat units which would say they are not unbelievably nervous about winter weather i mean the few snowflakes we saw last weekend is not a driver and i think as we said flat units with inflation are going to be the driver of the tire comp and the improvement at least weve seen in october john said relates to a service business we really need to see november and december to make a call on whether the consumer is going to stop deferring tires we certainly know they need them weve certainly seen a lot of ugly ones and when we do change them they are bald but too early to call and we hope that push us towards a plus  as opposed to what john said was the floor of plus  jamie albertine let me ask then as well it sounds like youre doing a great job to bring in new customers i guess first is there any data to suggest where you are pulling those customers from and what can you tell us about those new customers are they more inclined to spend or they have a higher income level versus maybe your core base so how should we think about the impact however small because im really trying to get a sense here of when can we expect the deferred maintenance cycle to end right and im looking for any evidence so that we confine to that extent so is there anything on the new customer side that can help us john w van heel the plus  in traffic for the quarter is a high number for us its a good number for us and it is a lot of new customers with regard to where theyre coming from i guess i could say to you that i think our sales trends in general are ahead of the other companies that im seeing in those ndas so i think were doing well there but those customers are coming in for oil changes and again we are looking to bring them back for additional service on their return visit and i think with regard to whether this is a real shift in the customer i would say that its not right now given the flat tire units but well let you know after the end of the quarter jamie albertine okay and im still beating the comp horse here but last question on comp from a regional perspective as youve grown into newer markets and i know theyre not flowing through your comp base in many cases yet but is there a clear or definitive performance difference in the newer markets versus the northeast and so to that end could you make the argument that perhaps your comp will be a little bit more predictable or be more stable over the next few years as they roll into your base john w van heel yes florida and georgia are doing well for us and i think the more exposure we get to those markets that will certainly help reduce some of the volatility that we have seen from winter weather and this discussion were having about november and december i view that as a positive the most important thing for us is to grow and increase our store density in our existing markets and as were talking about in florida and georgia here in these contiguous markets jamie albertine okay great john and everyone thanks again i appreciate and good luck in the current quarter operator moving on well go to scott stember with cl king scott stember most of my questions have been asked already but just going back to the comp range that you gave for the full year  to  it looks like you paired down the high end by just a smidge and in october we saw probably stronger than anybody expected comps up north of  i know you guys like to be conservative and justly so but is there anything else that were missing that we should be looking at any concerns that you have that is giving you any pause to maybe be a little bit more aggressive on the comp end john w van heel no october was consistent with the overall comp last year it was down too and in the fourth quarter we were down  in the third quarter and fourth quarter it was down  so i think theres nothing there that youre not seeing its just a bit of a conservatism giving out ph conservatism id like to make sure we hit the number scott stember got it thats fair enough and just last question i mean you guys have obviously done a very good job of attracting your customers into your stores for the services that you already sell but is there anything else out there anything new that you guys are working on any new services that is part of your broad initiative to increase your sales whether it would be more temperature controlled items or whatnot but is there anything thats in the works that possibly could be an additional driver going forward john w van heel what our focus is operationally is driving new customers in they need the basic work that we provide and our doing a better job with those customers you can see that as an example in the alignment category there is a need out there weve got an operational focus on it its a very high profit category for us and high customer satisfaction category because it helps them preserve the investments that theyve made in their tires thats where our focus is and thats where we think the biggest gains are for us we are looking at we are trying to do the best job we can addressing all the needs that our customers have scott stember got it thats all i have thanks so much for taking my questions operator that will conclude our questionandanswer session id like to turn it back to john van heel for any additional or closing comments john w van heel thank you all for your time this morning im looking forward to reporting on the continued positive impacts of our focus on sales and traffic and contributions from the acquisition opportunities were acting on our business model should produce another year of doubledigit eps growth on top of the  increase over the past two years we appreciate your continued support and the efforts of our employees
