growers board believes it is important to build a reserve during the course of this lease for several reasons if cargill chooses to exercise its option to purchase  interest in progold from american

of progold while lease income declines when capital exenditures occur distributions from progold will be reduced by building a reserve golden growers cooperative will be able to moderate the impact of those capital expenditures and declining lease revenue the distribution authorized by the board will result in a remaining equity credit balance for  of  with this payment golden growers has issued

president’s report scott stofferahn presented detailed results from last year’s member survey stofferahn complimented ggc members for their  response rate  “we used best practices to obtain a response but noboey would have predicted that we would have more than an  response rate this is considered phenomenal for a mail in survey” over the course of  years ggc anticipated changes in member farming status  at the time the cooperative was organized every member had to be a producer  that requirement was removed in  yet the response shows that  of members continue to be producers  another  indicated that htey are retired but ‘associated’ with a farming operation  generally these are people who while retired maintain an active relationship with their family members who are operating the farm  “for purposes of analyzing data we grouped producers with these ‘retired but associated’ members”  another  said that they were retired or not farming with no association with a farming operation electronic delivery – roughly  of members are not interested in electronic delivery of newsletters or payments investing results when asked about how ggc might pay for value added processing at the progold plant the majority recommended allowing individual members the opportunity to invest   favored using progold lease income for this purpose while the majority of members  were not interested in value added processing unrelated to the progold plant those who did show interest  had a preference for soybean crushing  of golden growers members consider themselves to be ‘accredited investors’ a term defined by the sec that measures income and assets to decide if someone is a sophisticated investor delivery results ggc members who meet their annual delivery requirement through direct deliveries to the plant method a pool also deliver an additional  million bushels on an annual basis  this means that nearly  of the annual grind comes from golden growers members among method b pool participants over  produce corn while  of method b respondents said they are not crop producers producer only responses compared to twenty years ago our members are planting more corn and soybeans  small grains and sunflowers are not nearly as comon within our membership as they were  of producers have a history of producing specialty crops with edible beans topping the list  of producers have raised nongm corn or soybeans for specialty markets  of producers are willing to produce crops for specialty markets  said they were not interested in producing nongm corn  yet  would consider producing nongm corn if an incentive was offered and  indicated that producing nongm corn would align with a crop rotation strategy  of producers indicated that they would produce for niche markets that would benefit the longterm stability of the progold plant “we believe this answer shows an underlying commitment by our producers for a successful enterprise” said stofferahn

wet milling market and valuation report april  in news by golden growersdr david ripplinger assistant professor at ndsu’s department of agribusiness  applied economics presented the recently filed ‘corn wet mill marketing analysis and valuation’ report at the golden growers annual meeting held on march rd dr ripplinger conducted a swat strengths weaknesses opportunities threats analysis for corn wet milling in our region  his research highlighted  decreased percapital hfcs consumption and a shift to alternative sweeteners as threats to the hfcs industry   increased world consumption new products and the renewable fuels standard were considered strengths ‘three factors impacting perception and consumption of hfcs stand out’ writes ripplinger  a broad popular conception that hfcs is unhealthy and leads to obesity  a large number of consumers avoid products containing genetically modified products and  consumption of sweetened soft drinks has tracked the fall of hfcs consumption in the united states strengths for the region include a competitive cost advantage for corn when compared to the corn belt  in addition golden growers has the advantage of being able to control the supply of corn to the plant  yet the cooperative does not have the history or experience in corn mill operations technology or food ingredients in terms of strategies the report recommends avoiding products with contradictory attributes ex nongm hfcs and to identify and pursue natural hedges against the decline of hfcs use advanced biofuels reduced calorie sweeteners derived from corn etc the next step is to build upon that research using value added producer grant funding obtained from usda’s rural development kyle althoff of equinox will lead that project in the coming months the full

growers cooperative is a valueadded agricultural cooperative association owned by  members primarily from minnesota north dakota and south dakota all of whom deliver corn to the cooperative for processing into a valueadded product golden growers cooperative was originally formed in  as a north dakota agricultural cooperative on september   by way of a series of mergers the cooperative changed its domicile and form of entity from a north dakota cooperative to a minnesota cooperative association governed under minnesota statutes chapter b a minnesota cooperative association formed under minnesota statutes b operates as a cooperative for state law purposes but is taxed as a partnership under subchapter k of the internal revenue code for tax purposes the cooperative is in the business of providing value to our members by facilitating their delivery of corn to the corn wetmilling facility owned by progold we accomplish our business on behalf of our members not through the ownership of assets such as a plant and equipment but through our contract relationships with all of the parties involved in the ownership and operation of the facility from an income production perspective our membership interest in progold is our primary asset that in addition to giving the cooperative the right to receive distributions from progold also provides our members with additional value for the delivery of their corn for processing annually the cooperative is required to deliver approximately  bushels of corn to cargill for processing at the progold facility we meet this delivery obligation by having our members deliver their corn to the progold facility since november  progold has leased its corn wetmilling facility to cargill annually cargill pays progold rent equal to  throughout the term of the lease between cargill and progold our members on the cooperative’s behalf have delivered corn to the facility for processing into high fructose corn syrup and related coproducts it is our ownership interest in progold that creates a valueadded relationship between our growers and the facility notwithstanding this cooperative arrangement cargill is an integral part of our financial success separate from the lease cargill also provides the cooperative services that allow us to facilitate corn delivery at little or no expense in addition the lease payments cargill makes to progold that are in turn distributed to the cooperative provide us with the cash to make distributions to our members if however at some time in the future progold stopped leasing its plant to cargill it is anticipated that the plant would continue operations managed either by progold or another party it is expected that the plant would continue to provide a market for the corn produced by our members whether the plant is leased in the future by cargill or another party or operated by progold any person residing in the united states can own our units as long as that person delivers or provides for the delivery of corn for processing at the progold facility ownership of our units requires our members to deliver corn to the cooperative in proportion to the number of units each member holds currently  units are issued and outstanding the cooperative’s income and losses are allocated to our members based on the volume of corn a member delivers or has delivered subject to certain limitations as long as a member patronizes the cooperative by delivering corn equal to the number of units held by the member the member will be allocated a corresponding portion of our income or loss in this way we operate on a cooperative basis to hold our units a member is required to execute a uniform member agreement that obligates the member to deliver corn to us and an annual delivery agreement by which each member annually elects the member’s method to deliver corn — either method a or method b or a combination of both under method a a member is required to physically deliver the required bushels of corn to us either at the progold facility or another location designated by the cooperative under method b a member appoints us as its agent to arrange for the acquisition and delivery of the required bushels of corn on the member’s behalf separate from leasing the facility from progold cargill is in the grain services business in order to most cost effectively provide delivery services to our members the cooperative has entered into an agreement with cargill whereby we appoint cargill as our agent to arrange for the delivery of the corn by our members who elect to deliver corn using method a and we appoint cargill as our agent to acquire corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver corn using method b if a member elects to deliver corn using method b the price per bushel the cooperative pays to the member is equal to the price per bushel paid by cargill to acquire the corn as our agent the cooperative pays members who deliver corn under method a the market price or contracted price for their corn at the time of delivery members who deliver corn under method a receive from the cooperative an incentive payment of  per bushel on the corn that they deliver while members who elect method b to deliver corn pay to the cooperative a  per bushel agency fee for the cost of having us deliver corn on their behalf the incentive payment for method a deliveries and the agency fee for method b deliveries are subject to annual adjustment at the sole discretion of our board of directors while the cooperative is financially responsible for the various payments to the members for corn cargill serving as the cooperative’s administrative agent issues payments to members for corn on the cooperative’s behalf annually we notify cargill of the number of bushels of method a corn to be delivered by each member who has elected to deliver corn by method a once we provide notification to cargill of the number of bushels of corn cargill then confirms the amount of corn with each member and notifies that member with respect to quality specifications allowances deductions and premiums to be applicable to that corn that method a member then directly contracts with cargill for the contract price agreed upon for the corn or in the absence of an agreed upon price the market price per bushel for corn delivered on the day on which the corn is delivered and accepted at the facility with respect to all corn that is delivered by method a cargill pays to the cooperative the aggregate purchase price for corn purchased from our members and then on our behalf makes individual payments for corn directly to our members in the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by method a delivers to cargill more than its delivery commitment any corn delivered in excess of that commitment is handled as a direct sale of corn to cargill and is priced at the current closing delivery corn price established by cargill at the facility on the day it is unloaded in the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by method a delivers to cargill less than its committed amount of corn the quantity of the shortfall is then purchased and delivered by cargill on our behalf but this purchased corn is not credited to such member’s account if a member fails to fully satisfy the corn delivery requirement cargill purchases replacement corn for which we reimburse cargill the amount by which the underlying contracted corn price is less than the price of buying the replacement corn that was due on the delivery date in addition if a member fails to deliver all of the corn it was obligated to deliver that member’s allocation of our profit or losses and any cash distributions is proportionately reduced and we may terminate the member’s membership based on the corn to be delivered by our members using method a cargill then purchases the remainder of the corn to be delivered by us on behalf of our method b delivering members at such time and in such quantities and at such prices it deems appropriate and in the best interest of us and cargill because cargill purchases the corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver using method b the purchase price for the corn that would be paid to our members if they actually delivered the corn is offset against the payment to be made by us to cargill for the cost to purchase the corn thus no payment is made from cargill to us for corn delivered using method b     view company supplier view company competition view company customers

like to hear from you provide feedback history  golden growers cooperative historyyou are here home  about  history corn growers in minnesota and the dakotas saw the potential for valueadded processing cooperatives in the s and early s the model created by sugar coops and a corn miller in southwest minnesota provided the incentive to consider possibilities for the tristate region in  discussion moved from speculation to planning at the same time american crystal sugar company in moorhead minn was considering expanding its product line to include corn sweeteners corn growers held their first meetings with american crystal that summer and the sugar coop committed resources to the project the group had a volunteer planning board and a conceptual agreement to pursue plans for a corn wet mill american crystal and a second beet sugar coop minndak wahpeton nd had expressed interest in joining in a project by march  the corn growers and sugar coops had developed a preliminary plan and each group had tentatively agreed to invest in the project plans called for a new corn growers’ cooperative to own  of the project american crystal to own  and minndak to own  minndak sold its share in  to american crystal it was decided the plant would focus on producing high fructose corn syrup hfcs the grind capacity was set at approximately  million bushels a year with maximum annual production of about  billion pounds of hfcs the corn growers group held meetings with prospective members asking for contributions to finance the development stage of the coop and fund its share of further research growers responded with  million in donations and golden growers cooperative ggc was born ggc then officially joined with american crystal and minndak to create progold llc and progold hired its first employees to begin planning and development of the project the staff and board hired a plant management team chose a site for the plant and chose an engineeringdesign company in may  ground was broken the progold plant at a acre site north of wahpeton and construction continued until the plant was operational in late  startup of the progold plant unfortunately coincided with the lowest hfcs prices in history in addition to the progold plant other hfcs factories in the us had been built or upgraded since  and the resulting overcapacity resulted in falling prices the low market prices created losses throughout the hfcs industry and progold was no exception although losses were anticipated for its startup year progold experienced much higher losses than expected in  and projected even greater losses for  progold sought a partner with strength in operations marketing and finance progold signed a lease agreement with cargill inc to operate its wahpeton plant and market the products from that plant through  the lease was renewed on january   to extend through december   coincidentally progold retired its debt for plant construction in january  ggc is
