subsidiaries this support may be required at times when in the absence of such frb policy it would not otherwise be required to provide support under michigan law if the capital of a michigan state chartered bank has become impaired by losses or otherwise the commissioner of the difs may require that the deficiency in capital be met by assessment upon the bank’s shareholders pro rata on the amount of capital stock held by each and if any such assessment is not paid by any shareholder within  days of the date of mailing of notice thereof to such shareholder cause the sale of the stock of such shareholder to pay such assessment and the costs of sale of such stock any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits

extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business including among other things permissible types and amounts of loans investments and other activities capital adequacy branching interest rates on loans and deposits and the safety and soundness of banking practices our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the dif of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif  the fdic assesses insurance premiums based upon a financial ratios method that takes into account assets and capital levels and supervisory ratings banking laws and regulations restrict transactions by insured banks owned by a bank holding company including loans to and certain purchases from the parent holding company nonbank and bank subsidiaries of the parent holding company principal shareholders officers directors and their affiliates and investments by the subsidiary bank in the shares or securities of the parent holding company or any of the other nonbank or bank affiliates or acceptance of such shares or securities as collateral security for loans to any borrower the bank is subject to legal limitations on the frequency and amount of dividends that can be paid to isabella bank corporation for example a michigan state chartered bank may not declare a cash dividend or a dividend in kind except out of net profits then on hand after deducting all losses and bad debts and then only if it will have a surplus amounting to not less than  of its capital after the payment of the dividend moreover a michigan state chartered bank may not declare or pay any cash dividend or dividend in kind until the cumulative dividends on its preferred stock if any have been paid in full further if the surplus of a michigan state chartered bank is at any time less than the amount of its capital before the declaration of a cash dividend or dividend in kind it must transfer to surplus not less than  of its net profits for the preceding six months in the case of quarterly or semiannual dividends or the preceding two consecutive six month periods in the case of annual dividends the payment of dividends by isabella bank corporation and the bank is also affected by various regulatory requirements and policies such as the requirement to keep adequate capital in compliance with regulatory guidelines federal laws impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends by insured banks that fail to meet specified capital levels the fdic may  table of contents prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the fdic  in addition payment of dividends by a bank may be prevented by the applicable federal regulatory authority if such payment is determined by reason of the financial condition of such bank to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice the frb and the fdic have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings additionally the frb board of governors requires a bank holding company to notify the frb prior to increasing its cash dividend by more than  over the prior year the aforementioned regulations and restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from the bank for our cash needs including payment of dividends and operating expenses the activities and operations of the bank are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations item a risk factors  in the normal course of business we are exposed to various risks these risks if not managed correctly could have a significant impact on our earnings capital share price and ability to pay dividends in order to effectively monitor and control the following risks we utilize an enterprise risk model we balance our strategic goals including revenue and profitability objectives with associated risks through the use of policies systems and procedures which have been adopted to identify assess control monitor and manage each risk area we continually review the adequacy and effectiveness of these policies systems and procedures our enterprise risk process covers each of the following areas changes in credit quality and required allowance for loan and lease losses to manage the credit risk arising from lending activities our most significant source of credit risk we maintain sound underwriting policies and procedures we continuously monitor asset quality in order to manage our credit risk to determine the appropriateness of valuation allowances these valuation allowances take into consideration various factors including but not limited to local regional and national economic conditions we maintain an alll to reserve for estimated incurred loan losses and risks within our loan portfolio the level of the alll reflects our evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience loan portfolio quality and economic political and regulatory conditions the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions an economic downturn within our local markets as well as downturns in the state national or global markets could negatively impact household and corporate incomes this could lead to decreased demand for both loan and deposit products and lead to an increase of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans we continually monitor key economic indicators in an effort to anticipate the possible effects of downturns in the local regional and national economies our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of michigan and the specific local markets in which we operate unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified we provide banking and financial services to customers located primarily in the clare gratiot isabella mecosta midland montcalm and saginaw counties in michigan the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession acts of terrorism outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations interest rate risk irr results from the timing differences in the maturity or repricing frequency of a financial institution’s interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities we monitor the potential effects of changes in interest rates through simulations and gap analyses to help mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates we make significant efforts to stagger projected cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  table of contents liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from our inability to meet our obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable costs liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources or failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value we have significant borrowing capacity through correspondent banks and the ability to sell certain investments to fund potential cash shortages which we may use to help mitigate this risk the value of investment securities may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in the market a volatile illiquid market or decline in credit quality could require us to recognize an otti loss related to the investment securities held in our portfolio we consider many factors in determining whether an otti exists including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than cost the investment credit rating and the probability that the issuer will be unable to pay the amount when due the presence of these factors could lead to impairment charges these risks are mitigated by the fact that we do not intend to sell the security in an unrealized loss position and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or external events and includes reputation risk and transaction risk reputation risk is developing and retaining marketplace confidence in handling customers’ financial transactions in an appropriate manner and protecting our safety and soundness transaction risk includes losses from fraud error the inability to deliver products or services and loss or theft of information transaction risk also encompasses product development and delivery transaction processing information technology systems and the internal control environment to minimize potential losses due to operational risks we have established a robust system of internal controls that is regularly tested by our internal audit department in conjunction with the services of certified public accounting firms who assist in performing such internal audit work the focus of these internal audit procedures is to verify the validity and appropriateness of various transactions processes and controls the results of these procedures are reported to our audit committee the adoption of violations of or nonconformance with laws rules regulations or prescribed practices the financial services industry and public companies are extensively regulated and must meet regulatory standards set by the fdic  difs  frb  fasb  sec  pcaob  the cfpb  and other regulatory bodies federal and state laws and regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not necessarily to benefit our shareholders the nature extent and timing of the adoption of significant new laws changes in existing laws or repeal of existing laws may have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition the effect of which is impossible to predict at this time our compliance department annually assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of our processes for controlling and managing our principal compliance risks we may not adjust to changes in the financial services industry our financial performance depends in part on our ability to maintain and grow our core deposit customer base and expand our financial services to our existing and new customers the increasingly competitive environment is in part a result of changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers new competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for our products and services financial services and products are also constantly changing our financial performance is also dependent upon customer demand for our products and services and our ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and services we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire subsidiaries over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition the majority of the recorded goodwill is related to acquisitions of other banks which were subsequently merged into isabella bank if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired we must writedown the goodwill by the amount of the impairment  table of contents we may face pressure from purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase loans sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to such loans we generally sell the fixed rate long term residential mortgage loans we originate to the secondary market in response to the recent economic downturn the purchasers of residential mortgage loans such as government sponsored entities increased their efforts to require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse the purchasers for losses incurred on foreclosed loans due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the terms of the contract consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions without the involvement of banks for example consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries in financial transactions could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits changes to the financial services industry as a result of regulatory changes or actions or significant litigation the financial services industry is extensively regulated by state and federal regulation that governs almost all aspects of our operations laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers depositors and the deposit insurance fund the impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution the classification of assets by the institution and the appropriateness of an institution’s alll  future regulatory changes or accounting pronouncements may increase our regulatory capital requirements or adversely affect our regulatory capital levels additionally actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require the dedication of significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information whether through cyber attacks breach of computer systems or other means as part of our business we collect and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties despite the security measures we have in place for our facilities and systems and the security measures of our third party service providers we may be vulnerable to cyber attacks security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data human errors or other similar events risks related to cybersecurity continue to evolve within the industry we continually review and monitor information and data related to cybersecurity to detect and mitigate attacks a cyber attack could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information whether by us or by our vendors could severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business our estimates and assumptions may be incorrect our consolidated financial statements conform with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements  these estimates are based on information available to us at the time the estimates are made actual results could differ from those estimates for further discussion

analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of the consolidated financial statements and statistical data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  executive summary we reported net income of  and earnings per common share of  for the year ended december    our earnings have primarily been the result of increased interest income driven by outstanding loan growth during  our strong credit quality resulted in a decline in the level of the alll in both amount and as a percentage of gross loans resulting in a reversal of provision for loan losses of  for the year ended

contributing to this growth in  were increases in both residential real estate and consumer loans of   our net yield on interest earning assets of  remains at historically low levels while the frb increased short term interest rates in december  and projects increases in  we do not anticipate significant improvements in our net yield on interest earning assets as the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will likely increase faster than those of interest earning assets net interest income will increase only through continued strategic growth in loans investments and other income earning assets we are committed to increasing earnings and shareholder value through growth in our loan portfolio growth in our investment and trust services and increasing our geographical presence while managing operating costs recent legislation the health care and education act of  the patient protection and affordable care act the doddfrank act  and the jobs act  have already had and are expected to continue to have a negative impact on our operating results of these four acts the doddfrank act has had the most significant impact the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has made significant changes in the regulation of financial institutions aimed at strengthening the oversight of the federal government over the operation of the financial services sector and increasing the protection of consumers new regulations issued by the cfpb regarding consumer lending including residential mortgage lending have increased our compensation and outside advisor costs and this trend is expected to continue on july   the frb published revised basel iii capital standards for banks the rules redefine what is included or deducted from equity capital changes risk weighting for certain on and offbalance sheet assets increases the minimum required equity capital to be considered well capitalized and introduces a capital cushion buffer the rules which will be gradually phased in between

acquisition intangibles and goodwill and the determination of the fair value and assessment of otti of investment securities to be our most critical accounting policies the alll requires our most subjective and complex judgment changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on the alll and therefore the provision for loan losses and results of operations we have developed policies and procedures for assessing the appropriateness of the alll  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to our loan portfolio our assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers which is not known to us at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements  for additional discussion concerning our alll and related matters see the detailed discussion to follow under the caption “ allowance for loan and lease losses ” and “ note  – loans and alll ” of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in item  financial statements and supplementary data  us generally accepted accounting principles require that we determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity and record their fair value on the date of acquisition we employ a variety of measures in the determination of the fair value including the use of discounted cash flow analysis market appraisals and projected future revenue streams for certain items that we believe we have the appropriate expertise to determine the fair value we may choose to use our own calculations of the value in other cases where the value is not easily determined we consult with outside parties to determine the fair value of the identified asset or liability once valuations have been adjusted the net difference between the price paid for the acquired entity and the net value of assets acquired on our balance sheet including identifiable intangibles is recorded as goodwill acquisition intangibles and goodwill are qualitatively evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying balance is impaired on at least an annual basis afs securities are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value included as a component of other comprehensive income declines in the fair value of afs securities below their cost that are otherthantemporary are reflected as realized losses in the consolidated statements of income we evaluate afs securities for indications of losses that are considered otherthantemporary  if any on a regular basis the market values for most afs investment securities are typically obtained from outside sources and applied to individual securities within the portfolio municipal securities for which no readily determinable market values are available are priced using fair value curves which most closely match the securitys credit ratings and maturities  table of contents average balances interest

successful for us and our customers as very few of the modified loans have resulted in foreclosures at the time of the tdr  the loan is reviewed to determine whether or not to classify the loan as accrual or nonaccrual status the majority of new modifications result in terms that satisfy our criteria for continued interest accrual tdrs that have been placed on nonaccrual status may be placed back on accrual status after six months of continued performance we restructure debt with borrowers who due to temporary financial difficulties are unable to service their debt under the original

offbalancesheet items to arrive at risk adjusted total assets regulatory capital is divided by the risk adjusted assets with the resulting ratio compared to the minimum standard to determine whether a corporation has adequate capital on july   the frb published revised basel iii capital standards for banks the final rules redefine what is included or deducted from equity capital changes risk weighting for certain on and  table of contents offbalance sheet assets increases the minimum required equity capital to be considered well capitalized and introduces a capital conservation buffer the rules which are being gradually phased in between  and  are not expected to have a material impact on the corporation but will require us to hold more capital than we have historically there are no significant regulatory constraints placed on our capital the frb ’s current recommended minimum primary capital to assets requirement is  our primary capital to adjusted average assets or tier  leverage ratio was  as of december    effective january   the minimum standard for primary or tier  capital increased from  to   the minimum standard for total capital remained at   also effective january   was the new common equity tier  capital ratio which had a minimum requirement of   beginning on january   the capital conservation buffer went into effect which further increased the

to consolidated financial statements” in item  financial statements and supplementary data  fair value we utilize fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures afs securities and certain liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis additionally from timetotime  we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis such as mortgage loans afs  impaired loans foreclosed assets omsr  and certain other assets and liabilities these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or writedowns of individual assets for further information regarding fair value measurements see “ note  – nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies ” and “ note  – fair value ” of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in item  financial statements and supplementary data  interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is determined by the amount of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing within a specific time period and their relative sensitivity to a change in interest rates we strive to achieve reasonable stability in the net interest margin through periods of changing interest rates one tool we use to measure interest rate sensitivity is gap analysis as shown in the following table the gap analysis depicts our position for specific time periods and the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets fixed interest rate afs securities are scheduled according to their contractual maturity fixed rate loans are included in the appropriate time frame based on their scheduled amortization variable rate loans which totaled  as of december    are included in the time frame of their earliest repricing time deposit liabilities are scheduled based on their contractual maturity except for variable rate time deposits in the amount of  that are included in the  to  month time frame savings and now accounts have no contractual maturity date and are believed by us to be predominantly noninterest rate sensitive these accounts have been classified in the gap table according to their estimated withdrawal rates based upon our analysis of deposit decay over the past five years we believe this decay experience is consistent with our expectation for the future as of december    we had a positive cumulative gap within one year a positive gap position results when more assets within a specified time frame have the potential to mature or reprice than liabilities  table of contents the following table shows the time periods and the amount of assets and liabilities available for interest rate repricing as of december    the

consists of members of senior management the committee reviews projected cash flows key ratios and liquidity available from both primary and secondary sources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered afs securities these categories totaled  or  of assets as of december   as compared to  or  as of december    liquidity is important for financial institutions because of their need to meet loan funding commitments depositor withdrawal requests and various other commitments including expansion of operations investment opportunities and payment of cash dividends liquidity varies significantly daily based on customer activity our primary source of funds is deposit accounts we also have the ability to borrow from the fhlb  the frb  and through various correspondent banks in the form of federal funds purchased and a line of credit these funding methods typically carry a higher interest rate than traditional market deposit accounts some borrowed funds including fhlb advances frb discount window advances and repurchase agreements require us to pledge assets typically in the form of afs securities or loans as collateral as of december    we had available lines of credit of   the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended december            variance net cash provided by used in operating activities

january         cash and cash equivalents december            market risk our primary market risks are interest rate risk and liquidity risk we have no significant foreign exchange risk except for interest rate locks and forward loan commitments in the management of irr  any changes in foreign exchange rates or commodity prices would not have a significant impact on our interest income and cash flows irr is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates irr results from the difference in the maturity or repricing frequency of a financial institutions interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities irr is the fundamental method by which financial institutions earn income and create shareholder value excessive exposure to irr could pose a significant risk to our earnings and capital the frb has adopted a policy requiring us to effectively manage the various risks that can have a material impact on our safety and soundness the risks include credit interest rate liquidity operational and reputational we have policies procedures and internal controls for measuring and managing these risks specifically our funds management policy and procedures include defining acceptable types and terms of investments and funding sources liquidity requirements limits on investments in long term assets limiting the mismatch in repricing opportunity of assets and liabilities and the frequency of measuring and reporting to our board the primary technique to measure irr is simulation analysis simulation analysis forecasts the effects on the balance sheet structure and net interest income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in interest rates the shape of yield curves interest rate relationships loan prepayments and changes in funding sources these forecasts are compared against net interest income projected in a stable interest rate environment while many assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require an evaluation to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior key assumptions in the simulation analysis include prepayments on loans probable calls of investment securities changes in market conditions loan volumes and loan pricing deposit sensitivity and customer preferences these assumptions are inherently uncertain as they are subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment as a result the simulation analysis cannot precisely forecast the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income actual results will differ from simulated results due to many other factors including changes in balance sheet components interest rate changes changes in market conditions and management strategies  table of contents our interest rate sensitivity is estimated by first forecasting the next  and  months of net interest income under an assumed environment of a constant balance sheet and constant market interest rates base case we then compare the results of various simulation analyses to the base case at december    we projected the change in net interest income during the next  and  months assuming market interest rates were to immediately decrease by  basis points and increase by    and  basis points in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve during the same time period we did not project scenarios showing decreases in interest rates beyond  basis points as this is considered extremely unlikely given current interest rate levels these projections were based on our assets and liabilities remaining static over the next  and  months while factoring in probable calls and prepayments of certain investment securities and real estate residential and consumer loans while it is extremely unlikely that interest rates would immediately increase to these levels we feel that these extreme scenarios help us identify potential gaps and mismatches in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities we regularly monitor our projected net interest income sensitivity to ensure that it remains within established limits as of december    our interest rate sensitivity results were within board approved limits the following tables summarize our interest rate sensitivity for  and  months as of   december      months    months immediate basis point change assumption shortterm                             percent change in net interest income vs constant rates                                         december      months

secondary method to measure irr  measures the cash flows andor the earliest repricing of our interest bearing assets and liabilities this analysis is useful for measuring trends in the repricing characteristics of the balance sheet significant assumptions are required in this process because of the embedded repricing options contained in assets and liabilities residential real estate and consumer loans allow the borrower to repay the balance prior to maturity without penalty while commercial and agricultural loans have prepayment penalties the amount of prepayments is dependent upon many factors including the interest rate of a given loan in comparison to the current offering rates the level of sales of used homes and the overall availability of credit in the market place generally a decrease in interest rates will result in an increase in cash flows from these assets a significant portion of our securities are callable or have prepayment options the call and prepayment options are more likely to be exercised in a period of decreasing interest rates savings and demand accounts may generally be withdrawn on request without prior notice the timing of cash flows from these deposits is estimated based on historical experience certificates of deposit have penalties that discourage early withdrawals  table of contents the following tables provide

active competition principally from other commercial banks savings banks and credit unions exists in all of our principal markets our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and changes in the local economic environment use of estimates in preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year actual results could differ from those estimates material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the alll  the fair value of afs investment securities and the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets fair value measurements  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts such sales or transfers based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability assumptions are developed based on prioritizing information within a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data such as the reporting entity’s own data we may choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those financial instruments for which there is an active market in cases where the market for a financial asset or liability is not active we include appropriate risk adjustments that market participants would make for nonperformance and liquidity risks when developing fair value measurements fair value measurements for assets and liabilities for which limited or no observable market data exists are accordingly based primarily upon estimates are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors therefore the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability additionally there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique and changes in the underlying assumptions used including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows could significantly affect the results of current or future values we utilize fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures investment securities afs are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis additionally from timetotime  we may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis such as mortgage loans afs  impaired loans foreclosed assets omsr  goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or writedowns of individual assets  table of contents fair value hierarchy under fair value measurement and disclosure authoritative guidance we group assets and liabilities measured at fair value into three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value based on the prioritization of inputs in the valuation techniques these levels are level  valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets level  valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market level  valuation is generated from model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market these unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the asset’s or liability’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs transfers between measurement levels are recognized at the end of reporting periods for further discussion of fair value considerations refer to “ note  – fair value ” significant group concentrations of credit risk  most of our activities conducted are with customers located within the central michigan area a significant amount of our outstanding loans are secured by commercial and residential real estate other than these types of loans there is no significant concentration to any other industry or any one customer cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances due from banks federal funds sold and other deposit accounts generally federal funds sold are for a one day period we maintain deposit accounts in various financial institutions which generally exceed federally insured limits or are not insured we do not believe we are exposed to any significant interest credit or other financial risk as a result of these deposits afs securities purchases of investment securities are generally classified as afs  however we may elect to classify securities as either held to maturity or trading securities classified as afs are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of the effect of deferred income taxes excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income included in afs securities are auction rate money market preferreds and preferred stocks these investments are considered equity securities for federal income tax purposes and as such no estimated federal income tax impact is expected or recorded auction rate money market preferred securities and preferred stocks are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities realized gains and losses on the sale of afs securities are determined using the specific identification method afs securities are reviewed quarterly for possible otti  in determining whether an otti exists for debt securities we assert that a we do not have the intent to sell the security and b it is more likely than not we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis if these conditions are not met we recognize an otti charge through earnings for the difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value and such amount is included in noninterest income for debt securities that do not meet the above criteria and we do not expect to recover the security’s amortized cost basis the security is considered otherthantemporarily impaired for these debt securities we separate the total impairment into the credit risk loss component and the amount of the loss related to market and other risk factors in order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a debt security we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover the amount of the total otti related to the credit risk is recognized in earnings and is included in noninterest income the amount of the total otti related to other risk factors is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income for debt securities that have recognized an otti through earnings if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in the cash flow expected the difference between the amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income afs equity securities are reviewed for otti at each reporting date this evaluation considers a number of factors including but not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers if it is determined that we do not have the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery or that there are conditions that indicate that a security may not recover in value then the difference between the fair value and the cost of the security is recognized in earnings and is included in noninterest income  table of contents loans loans that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any chargeoffs  the alll  and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loan based on the principal amount outstanding loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are capitalized and recognized as a component of interest income over the term of the loan using the level yield method the accrual of interest on agricultural commercial and mortgage loans is discontinued at the time the loan is  days or more past due unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection consumer loans are typically chargedoff no later than  days past due past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan in all cases loans are placed on nonaccrual or chargedoff at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or chargedoff  all interest accrued in the current calendar year but not collected is reversed against interest income while interest accrued in prior calendar years but not collected is charged against the alll  the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cashbasis until qualifying for return to accrual status loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured for impaired loans not classified as nonaccrual  interest income continues to be accrued over the term of the loan based on the principal amount outstanding allowance for loan and lease losses the alll is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectability of the loan balance is confirmed subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance we evaluate the alll on a regular basis which is based upon our periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience the nature and volume of the loan portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available the alll consists of specific general and unallocated components the specific component relates to loans that are deemed to be impaired for such loans that are also analyzed for specific allowance allocations an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that we believe affect our estimate of probable losses based on qualitative factors the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio loans may be classified as impaired if they meet one or more of the following criteria  there has been a chargeoff of its principal balance  the loan has been classified as a tdr  or  the loan is in nonaccrual status impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell if the loan is collateral dependent large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale on the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by aggregating outstanding commitments from investors or current investor yield requirements net unrealized losses if any would be recognized as a component of other noninterest expenses mortgage loans held for sale are sold with the mortgage servicing rights retained by us the carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by the cost allocated to the associated mortgage servicing rights gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related mortgage loans sold transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets including mortgage loans and participation loans are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered control over transferred assets is determined to be surrendered when  the assets have been legally isolated from us  the transferee obtains the right free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and  we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity other than servicing we have no substantive continuing involvement related to these loans servicing servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets we have no purchased servicing rights for sales of mortgage loans a portion of the cost of originating the  table of contents loan is allocated to the servicing right based on relative fair value fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts when available or alternatively is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income the valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income such as the cost to service the discount rate the custodial earnings rate an inflation rate ancillary income prepayment speeds and default rates and losses servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant risk characteristics such as interest rate loan type and investor type impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the tranche if we later determine that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to and over the period of the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets the unpaid principal balance of mortgages serviced for others was  and  with capitalized servicing rights of  and  at december   and   respectively servicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing

foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the lower of our carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer establishing a new cost basis any writedowns based on the asset’s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the alll  after foreclosure property held for sale is carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell impairment losses on property to be held and used are measured at the amount by which the carrying amount of property exceeds its fair value costs relating to holding these assets are expensed as incurred we periodically perform valuations and any subsequent writedowns are recorded as a charge to operations if necessary to reduce the carrying value of a property to the lower of our

been incurred under the incurred loss approach entities are limited to a probable initial recognition threshold when credit losses are measured under gaap an entity generally only considers past events and current conditions in measuring the incurred loss in the new guidance the incurred loss impairment methodology in current gaap is replaced with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses this methodology requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates the measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount an entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances which applies to assets measured either collectively or individually the update

it more likely than not that we will have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis • has the duration of the investment been extended during the fourth quarter of  we identified one

credit is wellsecured and in the process of collection upon transferring the loans to nonaccrual status we perform an evaluation to determine the net realizable value of the underlying collateral this evaluation is used to help determine if any chargeoffs are necessary consumer loans are typically chargedoff no later than  days past due past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan in all cases loans are placed on nonaccrual status or chargedoff at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or chargedoff  all interest accrued in the current calendar year but not collected is reversed against interest income while interest accrued in prior calendar years but not collected is charged against the alll  loans may be returned to accrual status after six months of continuous performance commercial and agricultural loans include loans for commercial real estate commercial operating loans advances to mortgage brokers farmland and agricultural production and states and political subdivisions repayment of these loans is dependent upon the successful operation and management of a business we minimize our risk by limiting the amount of direct credit exposure to any one borrower to   borrowers with direct credit needs of more than  are serviced through the use of loan participations with other commercial banks commercial and agricultural real estate loans commonly require loantovalue limits of  or less depending upon the type of loan past credit history and current operating results we may require the borrower to pledge accounts receivable inventory and property and equipment personal guarantees are generally required from the owners of closely held corporations partnerships and sole proprietorships in addition we require annual financial statements prepare cash flow analyses and review credit reports we entered into a mortgage purchase program in  with a financial institution where we participate in advances to mortgage brokers advances the mortgage brokers originate residential mortgage loans with the intent to sell on the secondary market we participate in the advance to the mortgage broker which is secured by the underlying mortgage loan until it is ultimately sold on the secondary market as such the average life of each participated advance is approximately  days  table of contents funds from the sale of the loan are used to payoff our participation in the advance to the mortgage broker we classify these advances as commercial loans and include the outstanding balance in commercial loans on our balance sheet under the participation agreement we committed to a maximum outstanding aggregate amount of  the difference between our outstanding balances and the maximum outstanding aggregate amount are classified as “ unfunded commitments under lines of credit ” in the “ contractual obligations and loan commitments ” section of the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report we offer adjustable rate mortgages construction loans and fixed rate residential real estate loans which have amortization periods up to a maximum of  years we consider the anticipated direction of interest rates balance sheet duration the sensitivity of our balance sheet to changes in interest rates and overall loan demand to determine whether or not to sell fixed rate loans to freddie mac  our lending policies generally limit the maximum loantovalue ratio on residential real estate loans to  of the lower of the appraised value of the property or the purchase price with the condition that private mortgage insurance is required on loans with loantovalue ratios in excess of   underwriting criteria for residential real estate loans include • evaluation of the borrower’s ability to make monthly payments • evaluation of the value of the property securing the loan • ensuring the payment of principal interest taxes and hazard insurance does not exceed  of a borrower’s gross income • ensuring all debt servicing does not exceed  of income • verification of acceptable credit reports • verification of employment income and financial information appraisals are performed by independent appraisers and reviewed for appropriateness all mortgage loan requests are reviewed by our mortgage loan committee or through a secondary market underwriting system loans in excess of  require the approval of our internal loan committee the executive loan committee the board of directors’ loan committee or the board of directors consumer loans include secured and unsecured personal loans loans are amortized for a period of up to  years based on the age and value of the underlying collateral the underwriting emphasis is on a borrower’s perceived intent and ability to pay rather than collateral value no consumer loans are sold to the secondary market the alll is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings loan losses are charged against the alll when we believe the uncollectability of the loan balance is confirmed subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the alll  the appropriateness of the alll is evaluated on a quarterly basis and is based upon a periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience the nature and volume of the loan portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available the primary factors behind the determination of the level of the alll are specific allocations for impaired loans historical loss percentages as well as unallocated components specific allocations for impaired loans are primarily determined based on the difference between the loan’s outstanding balance to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell historical loss allocations are calculated at the loan class and segment levels based on a migration analysis of the loan portfolio with the exception of advances to mortgage brokers over the preceding five years with no historical losses on advances to mortgage brokers there is no allocation in the commercial segment displayed below based on historical loss factors the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio  table of contents a summary of changes in the alll and the recorded investment in loans by segments follows allowance for loan losses   year

management has knowledge of improvements or deterioration of the credit quality of individual credits descriptions of the internally assigned credit risk ratings for commercial and agricultural loans are as follows  excellent – substantially risk free credit has strong financial condition and solid earnings history characterized by • high liquidity strong cash flow low leverage • unquestioned ability to meet all obligations when due • experienced management with management succession in place • secured by cash  high quality – limited risk credit with sound financial condition and a positive trend in earnings supplemented by • favorable liquidity and leverage ratios • ability to meet all obligations when due • management with successful track record • steady and satisfactory earnings history  table of contents • if loan is secured collateral is of high quality and readily marketable • access to alternative financing • well defined primary and secondary source of repayment • if supported by guaranty the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantors are clearly evident  high satisfactory – reasonable risk credit with satisfactory financial condition and further characterized by • working capital adequate to support operations • cash flow sufficient to pay debts as scheduled • management experience and depth appear favorable • loan performing according to terms • if loan is secured collateral is acceptable and loan is fully protected  low satisfactory – acceptable risk credit with bankable risks although some signs of weaknesses are shown • would include most startup businesses • occasional instances of trade slowness or repayment delinquency – may have been    days slow within the past year • management’s abilities are apparent yet unproven • weakness in primary source of repayment with adequate secondary source of repayment • loan structure generally in accordance with policy • if secured loan collateral coverage is marginal • adequate cash flow to service debt but coverage is low to be classified as less than satisfactory only one of the following criteria must be met  special mention – criticized credit constitutes an undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a classification of substandard the credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific loan • downward trend in sales profit levels and margins • impaired working capital position • cash flow is strained in order to meet debt repayment • loan delinquency     days and overdrafts may occur • shrinking equity cushion • diminishing primary source of repayment and questionable secondary source • management abilities are questionable • weak industry conditions • litigation pending against the borrower • collateral or guaranty offers limited protection • negative debt service coverage however the credit is well collateralized and payments are current  substandard – classified credit where the borrower’s current net worth paying capacity and value of the collateral pledged is inadequate there is a distinct possibility that we will implement collection procedures if the loan deficiencies are not corrected in addition the following characteristics may apply • sustained losses have severely eroded the equity and cash flow • deteriorating liquidity  table of contents • serious management problems or internal fraud • original repayment terms liberalized • likelihood of bankruptcy • inability to access other funding sources • reliance on secondary source of repayment • litigation filed against borrower • collateral provides little or no value • requires excessive attention of the loan officer • borrower is uncooperative with loan officer  vulnerable – classified credit is considered “substandard” and warrants placing on nonaccrual status risk of loss is being evaluated and exit strategy options are under review other characteristics that may apply • insufficient cash flow to service debt • minimal or no payments being received • limited options available to avoid the collection process • transition status expect action will take place to collect loan without immediate progress being made  doubtful – workout credit has all the weaknesses inherent in a “substandard” loan with the added characteristic that collection andor liquidation is pending the possibility of a loss is extremely high but its classification as a loss is deferred until liquidation procedures are completed or reasonably estimable other characteristics that may apply • normal operations are severely diminished or have ceased • seriously impaired cash flow • original repayment terms materially altered • secondary source of repayment is inadequate • survivability as a “going concern” is impossible • collection process has begun • bankruptcy petition has been filed • judgments have been filed • portion of the loan balance

following table summarizes our credit related financial instruments with offbalancesheet risk as of   december        unfunded commitments under lines of credit       commercial and standby letters of credit     commitments to grant loans     unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers these commitments may expire without being drawn upon and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements advances to mortgage brokers are also included in unfunded commitments under lines of credit the balance is the difference between our outstanding balances and maximum outstanding aggregate amount commitments to grant loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee the amount of collateral obtained if we deem necessary is based on managements credit evaluation of the customer commitments to grant loans include residential mortgage loans with the majority being loans committed to be sold to the secondary market commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions these commitments to extend credit and letters of credit generally mature within one year  the credit risk involved in these transactions is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers we evaluate each customer’s credit worthiness on a casebycase basis the amount of collateral obtained if we deem necessary upon the extension of credit is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower while we consider standby letters of credit to be guarantees the amount of the liability related to such guarantees on the commitment date is not significant and a liability related to such guarantees is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets our exposure to creditrelated loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit could be up to the contractual notional amount of those instruments we use the same credit policies in deciding to make these commitments as we do for extending loans to customers no significant losses are anticipated as a result of these commitments note  – onbalance sheet activities derivative loan commitments mortgage loan commitments are referred to as derivative loan commitments if the loan that will result from exercise of the commitment will be held for sale upon funding we enter into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specific times in the future with the intention that these loans will subsequently be sold in the secondary market a mortgage loan commitment binds us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate within a specified period of time generally up to  days after inception of the rate lock  table of contents outstanding derivative loan commitments expose us to the risk that the price of the loans arising from the exercise of the loan commitment might decline from the inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan due to increases in mortgage interest rates if interest rates increase the value of these loan commitments decreases conversely if interest rates decrease the value of these loan commitments increase the notional amount of undesignated interest rate lock commitments was   and   at december   and   respectively forward loan sale commitments to protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments we utilize both “mandatory delivery” and “best efforts” forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loan that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments with a “mandatory delivery” contract we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date if we fail to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date we are obligated to pay a “pairoff” fee based on then current market prices to the investor to compensate the investor for the shortfall with a “best efforts” contract we commit to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes generally the price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded eg on the same day the lender commits to lend funds to a potential borrower we expect that these forward loan sale commitments will experience changes in fair value opposite to the change in fair value of derivative loan commitments the notional amount of undesignated forward loan sale commitments was   and   at december   and   respectively the fair values of the rate lock loan commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale and the forward loan sale commitments are deemed insignificant by management and accordingly are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements  note  – commitments and other matters banking regulations require us to maintain cash reserve balances in currency or as deposits with the frb  at december   and   the reserve balances amounted to   and    respectively banking regulations limit the transfer of assets in the form of dividends loans or advances from the bank to the corporation at december    substantially all of the bank’s assets were restricted from transfer to the corporation in the form of loans or advances consequently bank dividends are the principal source of funds for the corporation payment of dividends without regulatory approval is limited to the current year’s retained net income plus retained net income for the preceding two years less any required transfers to common stock at january    the amount available to the corporation for dividends from the bank without regulatory approval was approximately    note  – minimum regulatory capital requirements the corporation on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the frb and the fdic  failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the frb and the fdic that if undertaken could have a material effect on our financial statements under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action we must meet specific capital guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets liabilities capital and certain offbalancesheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting standards our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the frb and the fdic about components risk weightings and other factors prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total tier  capital and common equity tier  capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and tier  capital to average assets as defined we believe as of december   and   that we met all capital adequacy requirements the frb has established minimum risk based capital guidelines pursuant to these guidelines a framework has been established that assigns risk weights to each category of on and offbalancesheet items to arrive at risk adjusted total assets regulatory capital is divided by the risk adjusted assets with the resulting ratio compared to the minimum standard to determine whether a corporation has adequate capital on july   the frb published revised basel iii capital standards for banks the final rules redefine what is included or deducted from equity capital changes risk weighting for certain on and  table of contents offbalance sheet assets increases the minimum required equity capital to be considered well capitalized and introduces a capital cushion buffer the rules which are being gradually phased in between  and  are not expected to have a material impact on the corporation but will require us to hold more capital than we have historically effective january   the minimum standard for primary or tier  capital increased from  to   the minimum standard for total capital remained at   also effective january   was the new common equity tier  capital ratio which had a minimum requirement of   the capital conservative buffer requirement began on january   which required a  addition to the tier  minimum and common equity tier  capital ratio the capital conservative buffer will continue to increase capital ratios each year through  as of december   and   the most recent notifications

values as such we classify cash and cash equivalents as level  afs securities afs securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis level  fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments level  fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments if quoted prices are not available fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows adjusted for the security’s credit rating prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss and liquidity assumptions the values for level  and level  investment securities are generally obtained from an independent third party on a quarterly basis we compare the values provided to alternative pricing sources mortgage loans afs  mortgage loans afs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value the fair value of mortgage loans afs are based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics as such we classify mortgage loans afs subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as level  loans  for variable rate loans with no significant change in credit risk fair values are based on carrying values fair values for fixed rate loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality the resulting amounts are adjusted to estimate the effect of changes in the credit quality of borrowers since the loans were originated as such we classify loans as level  assets we do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis however from timetotime  loans are classified as impaired and a specific allowance for loan losses may be established loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will be significantly different than the contractual terms of the original loan agreement are considered impaired once a loan is  table of contents identified as impaired we measure the estimated impairment the fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods including the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell if the loan is collateral dependent those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans we review the net realizable values of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent impaired loans on at least a quarterly basis for all loan types  to determine the collateral value we utilize independent appraisals broker price opinions or internal evaluations  we review these valuations to determine whether an additional discount should be applied given the age of market information that may have been considered as well as other factors such as costs to sell an asset if it is determined that the collateral will be liquidated in connection with the ultimate settlement of the loan we use these valuations to determine if any specific reserves or chargeoffs are necessary we may obtain new valuations in certain circumstances including when there has been significant deterioration in the condition of the collateral if the foreclosure process has begun or if the existing valuation is deemed to be outdated the following tables list the quantitative fair value information about impaired

company of st state bank in saginaw michigan which is a community bank that opened in  we made investments in valley financial corporation in  and in  and sold all shares in  we accounted for our investment under the equity method of accounting the lack of an active market or other independent sources to validate fair value estimates coupled with the impact of future capital calls and transfer restrictions is an inherent limitation in the valuation process as the fair values of these investments are not readily determinable they are not disclosed under a specific fair value hierarchy however they are reviewed quarterly for impairment if we were to record an impairment adjustment related to these securities it would be classified as a nonrecurring level  fair value adjustment during  and   there were no impairments recorded on equity securities without readily determinable fair values  table of contents foreclosed assets  upon transfer from the loan portfolio foreclosed assets which are included in other assets are adjusted to and subsequently carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell net realizable value is based upon independent market prices appraised values of the collateral or management’s estimation of the value of the collateral due to the inherent level of estimation in the valuation process we classify foreclosed assets as

goodwill and other intangible assets  acquisition intangibles and goodwill are evaluated for potential impairment on at least an annual basis acquisition intangibles and goodwill are typically qualitatively evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying balance is impaired if it is determined that the carrying balance of acquisition intangibles or goodwill is more likely than not to be impaired we perform a cash flow valuation to determine the extent of the potential impairment if the testing resulted in impairment we would classify goodwill and other acquisition intangibles subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as level  during  and   there were no impairments recorded on goodwill and other acquisition intangibles omsr  omsr which are included in other assets are subject to impairment testing to test for impairment we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates and prepayment speed assumptions currently quoted for comparable instruments and discount rates if the valuation model reflects a value less than the carrying value omsr are adjusted to fair value through a valuation allowance as determined by the model as such we classify omsr subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as level  deposits  the fair value of demand savings and money market deposits are equal to their carrying amounts and are classified as level  fair values for variable rate certificates of deposit approximate their carrying value fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits as such fixed rate certificates of deposit are classified as level  borrowed funds  the carrying amounts of federal funds purchased borrowings under overnight repurchase agreements and other shortterm borrowings maturing within ninety days approximate their fair values the fair values of other borrowed funds are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing arrangements as such borrowed funds are classified as level  accrued interest payable the carrying amounts of accrued interest payable approximate fair value as such we classify accrued interest payable as level  derivative instruments derivative instruments consisting solely of interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges when highly effective are reported at fair value in other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value recorded in oci should the hedge no longer be considered effective the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings in the period in which the change occurs the fair value of a derivative is determined by quoted market prices and model based valuation techniques as such we classify derivative instruments as level  commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit and undisbursed loans our commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit and undisbursed funds have no carrying amount and are estimated to have no realizable fair value historically a majority of the unused commitments to extend credit have not been drawn upon and generally we do not receive fees in connection with these commitments other than standby letter of credit fees which are not significant  table of contents the preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement estimated fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis disclosure of the estimated fair values of financial instruments which differ from carrying values often requires the use of estimates in cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available we use present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments these valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used the
