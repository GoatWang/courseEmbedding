this stunning new sculptured bust of richard iii has been produced for us by the highly acclaimed artist  sculptor nick hunter and produced exclusively by ourselves here at oakapple designs ltd in the uk the body of richard was recently discovered underneath a car park in the city of leicester and has consequently resumed the great interest in one of england’s most famous kings killed at the battle

but has more details emerge the truth will finally be unveiled this inspiration for the sculpture was taken from both the existing classical portrait paintings of richard along with the new facial reconstruction done by leicester university this new portrait shows richard in a new light with more facial accuracy but still with that expression of uncertainty and imposed responsibility this

she wrote her bestknown and most influential works such asthe human condition the origins of totalitarianism and on revolution yet despite the fact that a substantial portion of her oeuvre was written in america not europe no one has directly considered the influence of america on her thought until now in arendt and america historian richard h king argues that while all of arendts work was haunted by her experience of totalitarianism it was only in her adopted homeland that she was able to formulate the idea of the modern republic as an alternative to totalitarian rulesituating arendt within the context of us intellectual political and social history king reveals how arendt developed a fascination with the political thought of the founding fathers king also recreates her intellectual exchanges with american friends and colleagues such as dwight macdonald and mary mccarthy and shows how her lively correspondence with sociologist david riesman helped her understand modern american culture and society in the last section ofarendt and america king sets out the context in which the eichmann controversy took place and follows the debate about the banality of evil that has continued ever since as king shows arendts work regardless of focus was shaped by postwar american thought culture and politics including the civil rights movement and the cold warfor arendt the united states was much more than a refuge from nazi germany it was a stimulus to rethink the political ethical and historical traditions of human culture this authoritative combination of intellectual history and biography offers a unique approach for thinking about the influence of america on arendts ideas and also the effect of her ideas on american thoughtphilosophers th century politicalcondition hpb

analysis helped unravel the mystery mar   dr king working at the university of leicester uk image  university of leicester   this is not a standard forensics case ancient dna is different from dna you would find at a crime scene dr turi king university of leicester as king richard iii is finally laid to rest at leicester cathedral uk after his remains were discovered buried beneath a leicester parking lot in  we reveal how the scientists working on the project identified the king studying history with science a series of rigorous scientific investigations carried out at the university of leicester unanimously identified king richard iii the last plantagenet king who died in  from remains discovered at the site of an ancient church which is a parking lot today the extended research team undertook a series of investigations including genealogy to identify living relatives of the deceased dna analysis to confirm a genetic match psychology to reassess richard iiis personality osteology to understand the way in which richard iii lived and died forensic analysis to assess his wounds and carbon dating to investigate the age of the skeletal remains we spoke to dr turi king lecturer in genetics and archeology at the university of leicester who was responsible for the genetic identification of the skeleton dr king was initially invited to play a part in the project by richard buckley university of leicester archaeological services because of her background in both archaeology and genetics dr king spoke of this being a dream project given her interest in using genetics to look at history her main research focus for nearly  years the science behind the discovery dr king used standard dna sequencing techniques to match the skeleton’s dna with two relatives of richard iii on the maternal line the work required that the skeleton’s excavation was carried out following strict guidelines and under clean conditions to guarantee the sample’s integrity – not unlike forensic evidence collection dr king carried out the modern dna analysis at the university of leicester while the ancient dna analysis was performed at two dedicated ancient dna facilities dr king carried out the ancient dna analysis in the lab of professor michael hofreiter with gloria gonzales fortes at the ancient dna facilities university of york uk working in sterile conditions the excavated tooth was carefully cleaned and treated with uv light prior to crushing and extraction of the dna mitochondrial dna mtdna was first used as opposed to nuclear dna one of the main reasons for this is that there can be several mitochondria per cell compared to only one nucleus leading to a greater chance of recovering a workable amount of ancient dna to analyze this technique does incur limitations as mtdna is inherited maternally only direct relatives from the maternal line can be used as a comparison this is where the genetic analysis tied in with another key area of the project genealogy and the participation of living relatives of richard iii from the maternal line subsequently the mtdna was amplified using conventional pcr whereby the dna was subjected to thermal cycling to produce millions of copies of the dna fragments this method requires the use of a primer set deoxynucleoside triphosphates and a dna polymerase following this the amplified dna was sequenced using the sanger method in which the pattern of dna bases was compared to that of the modern day maternal lineages results were then independently verified at the université paul sabatier in france with dr patricia balaresque and dr laure tonasso verification of the results confirmed the dna analysis corroborates with the archeological findings taken together this concluded that the remains belong to king richard iii an ancient forensics investigation the richard iii project has an element of modern forensics in respect to the identification of unearthed remains and the victim’s possible death from two injuries to the skull during the  battle of bosworth dr king said “although similar this is not a standard forensics case ancient dna is different from dna you would find at a crime scene because of its age there are certain degradation patterns in ancient dna whereby if you know how degradation occurs you can take this into consideration when analyzing the dna” immense public interest with the extreme amount of interest in this project dr king is keen to avoid ‘sensational’ science king went on to say that as the remains happened to be from a “chap who turned out to be quite famous” which sparked immediate press interest she admitted that this did cause considerable pressure to complete the dna analysis in a certain time frame dr king modestly spoke about the science reaching the broader audience saying “the public have known about neanderthal ancient dna work that has been done so this project is fairly recent with a  year old subject” in relative terms this is quite a recent specimen but never the less the scientific analysis has confirmed a significant historical discovery this project has reached a global audience with interested individuals getting in contact from all over the world dr king said “the biggest thing to deal with at the moment is all the emails from people who believe they may be descendents of richard iii and who wish to be tested” one individual offered to send their tooth for dr king to extract dna from – presumably one that had already been removed even with the sudden influx in emails and her busy schedule dr king finds the

up with michael ibsen whose dna helped to identify the skeleton discovered in a leicester car park as that of richard iii friday th march  submitted by emma mason share share tweet plus bbc history magazine   issues for £ in  as she sat down to dinner with her husband in a small town in ontario canada michael ibsen’s mother joy received the most curious of phonecalls at the other end of the line was british historian john ashdownhill who told her she might be related to richard iii’s sister joy was informed she had been tracked down as part of a project to identify the possible remains of margaret of york sister of richard iii and edward iv ashdownhill had traced an allfemale line of descent from another sister anne of york to the retired canadian journalist and wanted to know if she would consider giving a dna sample this was how joy’s son michael ibsen a cabinetmaker living in paddington came to later discover he was a descendant of richard iii in  following the death of his mother four years earlier michael provided a dna sample to help the university of leicester team with testing in the event that any remains were found at the grey friars church site if researchers were to find remains michael’s mitochondrial dna which is traced through the maternal line from mother to child and does not change over time could help to determine their identity in leicester on wednesday less than  hours before richard iii’s reinterment we spoke to michael about being related to such a divisive monarch and found out what it was like to design and make the king’s coffin…   q what has this experience been like for you a it’s been an interesting journey because it’s been spread out over such a long period of time michael’s mother was first contacted in  there have been these bursts of activity in terms of interest from the media i’ve been asked a lot by people outside leicester cathedral this week ‘how has this changed your life’ it hasn’t really changed my life at all but it’s fascinating to be part of history it’s leapt out of the pages of a book – like something out of indiana jones in a way it’s a great privilege to be involved in something like this – it’s fascinating but the intensity of this week has taken me by surprise on sunday when richard iii’s coffin was taken from the university of leicester on an allday procession attended by tens of thousands of people i found myself sat in front of this wall of media half a metre from a coffin that i had made that contained the remains of richard iii i just sat there thinking ‘how on earth did i come to be here what a strange sequence of events’ during the procession a number of roads were closed so my brother and sister and i just had to get out and walk like everyone else it was great because no one noticed us people were following the cortege moving towards the cathedral and although my brother and sister and i are not particularly emotional people we found ourselves caught up in this strange atmosphere of wonder the whole thing has been such a strange series of coincidences and things coming together one after another – the science the archaeology it’s extraordinary richard iiis coffin in leicester cathedral the day before his reinterment q when did you first learn that you were related to richard iii a initially in  my mother didn’t tell anyone other than my brother about john ashdownhill’s phone call my brother specialises in privacy issues associated with medical information so he spent some time looking into it before my mother provided a dna sample it wasn’t until a few months later when we were all together as a family that she announced that she was descended from anne of york and related to richard iii of course we as offspring were similarly related you have to remember that at that point we didn’t know anything about the possible excavations to search for richard iii – he was just a figure in the distant past and we knew that possibly millions of other people might be related to him in the same way it wasn’t until the prospect of the dig became a reality and the business of the mitochondrial dna connection being a valid aspect of the story that our ears pricked up and we became a lot more interested the leicester team asked me to be present on the first day of the dig but i went home afterwards thinking ‘good luck to them’ doubting that they would find anything i had no idea at the time that they had unearthed richard already richard iii’s remains were discovered six hours  minutes and  seconds in to the dig at just after pm on saturday  august  they were very good at keeping that quiet following the public announcement of the discovery of remains in october  it all went from there   q did you know much about richard iii before all this a i knew what probably everyone else knew that he was a king of england with a bad reputation largely because of the princes in the tower in my twenties i read the daughter of time by josephine tey  which of course is about a modern detective alan grant trying to solve the mystery of the princes in the tower the book stimulated an interest in the period for me and i went to see for myself the portrait of richard iii that features in it which is housed at the national portrait gallery in the novel grant becomes engrossed in the portrait i used to go once a year just to have a look at the painting for no particular reason i now think ‘how odd that for  or so years i’ve been going to look at this portrait and then suddenly richard becomes a presence in my life’   q what was it like to design and make richard iii’s coffin a the team asked me more than a year ago whether i would consider doing it it was all under the radar at first so i couldn’t talk to anyone about it it was an interesting process – i wanted to first look into the history and find out what richard’s coffin would have looked like if he had had one so i got in touch with an expert in burial customs and he very helpfully found out for me that at the time it was highly unusual for people to have had a coffin – certainly a wooden coffin so it seemed to me that we had more of an open brief historically in terms of what we could do with the coffin i had at that point already designed something that really looked more like a piece of furniture than a coffin so i ripped up the design and came up with something much simpler i wanted people to be able to identify with it in some basic way i thought first of all ‘if richard iii had had a coffin it would probably have been made with english oak’ which i understand was used for high status funerals oak is embedded in the british psyche in some curious way the inside of the coffin is made with yew which was used to make longbows and has a sort of mystical sense to it – it’s found in churchyards and was associated with funerals for centuries i gather i wanted people to see these materials used very simply but sourced from the best possible woodlands and of the best quality i was very fortunate because i was in touch with a sawmill that had contacts with the duchy of cornwall so we were able to source the oak from one of the ancient woodlands that belonged to the duchy of cornwall in herefordshire the duchys harewood end estate this was a wonderful link because the duke of cornwall was also the prince of wales and guess who the prince of wales was during richard’s reign it was richard’s young son who was given the title before he died as a child probably of tuberculosis therefore richard’s son as the duke of cornwall would have inherited the duchy of cornwall estates when he came of age so you have this wonderful connection – richard being buried in timber sourced from the duchy of cornwall woodlands it honours richard i hope richard iii’s coffin was taken from the university of leicester on an allday procession on sunday darren stapleswpa rotapress association images   q you earlier described richard as a king with ‘a bad reputation’ does it bother you that you are related to such a controversial king a obviously it would be nice to be related to a more benign monarch as it were but i sometimes say to people ‘who would you rather be related to henry viii or richard iii’ i mean henry viii didn’t exactly have a great reputation either but i think one of the great things about this whole episode is that it’s forcing people to rethink what’s been written about richard iii and about his reign and his life my own reading is that richard was very much a product of his time how do you look at medieval life through stcentury eyes what we would find utterly unacceptable was probably just part of everyday life for many people back then and vice versa – medieval people looking at our society would certainly have questions what place does the church have in people’s lives now compared to back then for example over the past yearandahalf i’ve warmed to richard iii in a way i perhaps hadn’t before   q how do

eleanor of aquitaine he was known as richard cœur de lion or richard the lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior he was also known in occitan as oc e no yes and no because of his reputation for terseness by the age of  richard had taken command of his own army putting down rebellions in poitou against his father richard was a central christian commander during the third crusade leading the campaign after the departure of philip ii of france and scoring considerable victories against his muslim counterpart saladin although he did not retake jerusalem from saladin richard spoke both french and occitan he was born in england where he spent his childhood before becoming king however he lived most of his adult life in the duchy of aquitaine in the southwest of france following his accession he spent very little time perhaps as little as six months in england most of his life as king was spent on crusade in captivity or actively defending his lands in france rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies nevertheless he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects he remains one of the few kings of england remembered by his epithet rather than regnal number and is an enduring iconic figure both in england

great seal of  richard was born on  september  probably at beaumont palace in oxford england son of king henry ii and eleanor of aquitaine he was a younger brother of count william ix of poitiers henry the young king and duchess matilda of saxony as the third legitimate son of king henry ii he was not expected to ascend the throne he was also an elder brother of duke geoffrey ii of brittany queen eleanor of castile queen joan of sicily and count john of mortain who succeeded him as king richard was the younger maternal halfbrother of countess marie of champagne and countess alix of blois the eldest son of henry ii and eleanor william died in  before richards birth richard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother his father was angevinnorman and greatgrandson of william the conqueror contemporary historian ralph of diceto traced his familys lineage through matilda of scotland to the anglosaxon kings of england and alfred the great and from there linked them to noah and woden according to angevin legend there was even infernal blood in the family while his father visited his lands from scotland to france richard probably spent his childhood in england his first recorded visit to the european continent was in may  when his mother took him to normandy his wet nurse was hodierna of st albans whom he gave a generous pension after he became king little is known about richards education although he was born in oxford and brought up in england up to his eighth year it is not known to what extent he used or understood english he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in limousin lenga dòc and also in french during his captivity english prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother john to help destroy the authority of richards chancellor william longchamp who was a norman one of the specific charges laid against longchamp by johns supporter hugh bishop of coventry was that he could not speak english this indicates that by the late th century a knowledge of english was expected of those in positions of authority in england richard was said to be very attractive his hair was between red and blond and he was lighteyed with a pale complexion he was apparently of above average height according to clifford brewer he was  feet  inches  m as with his supposed lack of english the question of his stature is one made from a lack of evidence as his remains have been lost since at least the french revolution and his exact height is unknown john his youngest brother by the same father and mother was known to be  feet  inches  m the itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis ricardi a latin prose narrative of the third crusade states that he was tall of elegant build the colour of his hair was between red and gold his limbs were supple and straight he had long arms suited to wielding a sword his long legs matched the rest of his body from an early age he showed significant political and military ability becoming noted for his chivalry and courage as he fought to control the rebellious nobles of his own territory his elder brother henry the young king was crowned king of england during his fathers lifetime marriage alliances were common among medieval royalty they led to political alliances and peace treaties and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each others lands in march  it was arranged that richard would marry one of the daughters of ramon berenguer iv count of barcelona however these arrangements failed and the marriage never took place henry the young king was married to margaret daughter of louis vii of france on  november  despite this alliance between the plantagenets and the capetians the dynasty on the french throne the two houses were sometimes in conflict in  the intercession of pope alexander iii was necessary to secure a truce between them henry ii had conquered brittany and taken control of gisors and the vexin which had been part of margarets dowry early in the s there had been suggestions richard should marry alys countess of the vexin alice fourth daughter of louis vii because of the rivalry between the kings of england and france louis obstructed the marriage a peace treaty was secured in january  and richards betrothal to alys was confirmed henry ii planned to divide his and eleanors territories among their three eldest surviving sons henry would become king of england and have control of anjou maine and normandy richard would inherit aquitaine and poitiers from his mother and geoffrey would become duke of brittany through marriage with constance heir presumptive of conan iv at the ceremony where richards betrothal was confirmed he paid homage to the king of france for aquitaine thus securing ties of vassalage between the two after henry ii fell seriously ill in  he put in place his plan to divide his kingdom although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories in  richard left for aquitaine with his mother and henry ii gave him the duchy of aquitaine at the request of eleanor richard and his mother embarked on a tour of aquitaine in  in an attempt to pacify the locals together they laid the foundation stone of st augustines monastery in limoges in june  richard was formally recognised as the duke of aquitaine when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office the ceremony took place in poitiers and was repeated in limoges where he wore the ring of st valerie who was the personification of aquitaine revolt against henry iiedit main article revolt of – according to ralph of coggeshall henry the young king instigated rebellion against henry ii he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him and to break away from his dependence on henry ii who controlled the purse strings there were rumors that eleanor might have encouraged her sons to revolt against their father henry the young king abandoned his father and left for the french court seeking the protection of louis vii his younger brothers richard and geoffrey soon followed him while the fiveyearold john remained in england louis gave his support to the three sons and even knighted richard tying them together through vassalage jordan fantosme a contemporary poet described the rebellion as a war without love geoffrey de rancons château de taillebourg the castle richard retreated to after henry iis forces captured  knights and  archers who fought for richard when saintes was captured the three brothers made an oath at the french court that they would not make terms with henry ii without the consent of louis vii and the french barons with the support of louis henry the young king attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money one such baron was philip count of flanders who was promised £ and several castles the brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in england robert de beaumont rd earl of leicester joined forces with hugh bigod st earl of norfolk hugh de kevelioc th earl of chester and william i of scotland for a rebellion in suffolk the alliance with louis was initially successful and by july  the rebels were besieging aumale neufmarché and verneuil and hugh de kevelioc had captured dol in brittany richard went to poitou and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father eleanor was captured so richard was left to lead his campaign against henry iis supporters in aquitaine on his own he marched to take la rochelle but was rejected by the inhabitants he withdrew to the city of saintes which he established as a base of operations in the meantime henry ii had raised a very expensive army of more than  mercenaries with which to face the rebellion he marched on verneuil and louis retreated from his forces the army proceeded to recapture dol and subdued brittany at this point henry ii made an offer of peace to his sons on the advice of louis the offer was refused henry iis forces took saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison although richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers he took refuge in château de taillebourg for the rest of the war henry the young king and the count of flanders planned to land in england to assist the rebellion led by the earl of leicester anticipating this henry ii returned to england with  soldiers and his prisoners including eleanor and his sons wives and fiancées but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed william i of scotland and hugh bigod were captured on  and  july respectively henry ii returned to france and raised the siege of rouen where louis vii had been joined by henry the young king after abandoning his plan to invade england louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in september  the treaty of montlouis when henry ii and louis vii made a truce on  september  its terms specifically excluded richard abandoned by louis and wary of facing his fathers army in battle richard went to henry iis court at poitiers on  september and begged for forgiveness weeping and falling at the feet of henry who gave richard the kiss of peace several days later richards brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father the terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict when richard was offered four castles in aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy richard was given control of two castles in poitou and half the income of aquitaine henry the young king was given two castles in normandy and geoffrey was permitted half of brittany eleanor remained henry iis prisoner until his death partly as insurance for richards good behaviour final years of henry iis reignedit a silver denier of richard struck in his capacity as the count of poitiers after the conclusion of the war the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against henry ii began the king travelled to anjou for this purpose and geoffrey dealt with brittany in january  richard was dispatched to aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him the historian john gillingham notes that the chronicle of roger of howden is the main source for richards activities in this period according to the chronicle most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in  days before the outbreak of war while others were to be razed given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles this was not an easy task roger of howden records the twomonth siege of castillonsuragen while the castle was notoriously strong richards siege engines battered the defenders into submission on this campaign richard acquired the name the lion or the lionheart due to his noble brave and fierce leadership  he is referred to as this our lion hic leo noster as early as  in the topographia hibernica of giraldus cambrensis while the byname lionheart le quor de lion is first recorded in ambroises lestoire de la guerre sainte in the context of the accon campaign of  henry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him it was suspected that henry had appropriated princess alys richards betrothed the daughter of louis vii of france by his second wife as his mistress this made a marriage between richard and alys technically impossible in the eyes of the church but henry prevaricated he regarded alyss dowry vexin in the îledefrance as valuable richard was discouraged from renouncing alys because she was the sister of king philip ii of france a close allycitation needed after his failure to overthrow his father richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of aquitaine especially in the territory of gascony the increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in  hoping to dethrone richard the rebels sought the help of his brothers henry and geoffrey the turning point came in the charente valley in the spring of  the welldefended fortress of taillebourg seemed impregnable the castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a threelayer wall richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat the garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked richard he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates where he easily took over the castle in two days richard the lionhearts victory at taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him it also won richard a reputation as a skilled military commander in – richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of angoulême his opponents turned to philip ii of france for support and the fighting spread through the limousin and périgord the excessive cruelty of richards punitive campaigns aroused even more hostility however with support from his father and from the young king richard the lionheart eventually succeeded in bringing the viscount aimar v of limoges and count elie of périgord to terms after richard had subdued his rebellious barons he again challenged his father from  to  the tension between henry and richard grew as king henry commanded richard to pay homage to henry the young king but richard refused finally in  henry the young king and geoffrey duke of brittany invaded aquitaine in an attempt to subdue richard richards barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke however richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies and they executed any prisoners the conflict paused briefly in june  when the young king died with the death of henry the young king richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the english crown king henry demanded that richard give up aquitaine which he planned to give to his youngest son john as his inheritance richard refused and conflict continued between them henry ii soon gave john permission to invade aquitaine to strengthen his position in  richard allied himself with yearold philip ii the son of eleanors exhusband louis vii by adele of champagne roger of howden wrote the king of england was struck with great astonishment and wondered what this alliance could mean and taking precautions for the future frequently sent messengers into france for the purpose of recalling his son richard who pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father made his way to chinon and in spite of the person who had the custody thereof carried off the greater part of his fathers treasures and fortified his castles in poitou with the same refusing to go to his father overall howden is chiefly concerned with the politics of the relationship between richard and king philip gillingham has addressed theories suggesting that this political relationship was also sexually intimate which he posits probably stemmed from an official record announcing that as a symbol of unity between the two countries the kings of england and france had slept overnight in the same bed gillingham has characterized this as an accepted political act nothing sexual about it a bit like a modernday photo opportunity in exchange for philips help against his father richard promised to concede to him his rights to both normandy and anjou richard paid homage to philip in november  with news arriving of the battle of hattin he took the cross at tours in the company of other french nobles in  henry ii planned to concede aquitaine to his youngest son john but richard refused the thought he felt that aquitaine was his and that john was unfit to take over the land once belonging to his beloved mother this refusal is what finally made henry ii bring queen eleanor out of prison he sent her to aquitaine and demanded that richard give up his lands to his mother who would once again rule over those lands the following year richard attempted to take the throne of england for himself by joining philips expedition against his father on  july  the forces of richard and philip defeated henrys army at ballans henry with johns consent agreed to name richard his heir apparent two days later henry ii died in chinon and richard the lionheart succeeded him as king of england duke of normandy and count of anjou roger of howden claimed that henrys corpse bled from the nose in richards presence which was assumed to be a sign that richard had caused his death king and crusaderedit coronation and antijewish violenceedit richard i being anointed during his coronation in westminster abbey from a thcentury chronicle richard i was officially invested as duke of normandy on  july  and crowned king in westminster abbey on  september  richard barred all jews and women from the investiture but some jewish leaders arrived to present gifts for the new king according to ralph of diceto richards courtiers stripped and flogged the jews then flung them out of court when a rumour spread that richard had ordered all jews to be killed the people of london attacked the jewish population many jewish homes were burned down and several jews were forcibly baptised some sought sanctuary in the tower of london and others managed to escape among those killed was jacob of orléans a respected jewish scholar roger of howden in his gesta regis ricardi claimed that the jealous and bigoted citizens started the rioting and that richard punished the perpetrators allowing a forcibly converted jew to return to his native religion baldwin of forde archbishop of canterbury reacted by remarking if the king is not gods man he had better be the devils silver penny of richard i york museums trust realising that the assaults could destabilise his realm on the eve of his departure on crusade richard ordered the execution of those responsible for the most egregious murders and persecutions including rioters who had accidentally burned down christian homes he distributed a royal writ demanding that the jews be left alone the edict was loosely enforced however and the following march further violence occurred including a massacre at york crusade plansedit richard had already taken the cross as count of poitou in  his father and philip ii had done so at gisors on  january  after receiving news of the fall of jerusalem to saladin after richard became king he and philip agreed to go on the third crusade since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross he started to raise and equip a new crusader army he spent most of his fathers treasury filled with money raised by the saladin tithe raised taxes and even agreed to free king william i of scotland from his oath of subservience to richard in exchange for  marks to raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions lands and other privileges to those interested in them those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts william longchamp bishop of ely and the kings chancellor made a show of bidding £ to remain as chancellor he was apparently outbid by a certain reginald the italian but that bid was refused richard made some final arrangements on the continent he reconfirmed his fathers appointment of william fitz ralph to the important post of seneschal of normandy in anjou stephen of tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement payn de rochefort an angevin knight was elevated to the post of seneschal of anjou in poitou the exprovost of benon peter bertin was made seneschal and finally in gascony the household official helie de la celle was picked for the seneschalship there after repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his french possessions richard finally set out on the crusade in summer  his delay was criticised by troubadours such as bertran de born he appointed as regents hugh de puiset bishop of durham and william de mandeville rd earl of essex—who soon died and was replaced by richards chancellor william longchamp richards brother john was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against william when richard was raising funds for his crusade he was said to declare i would have sold london if i could find a buyer occupation of sicilyedit richard and philip of france french manuscript of  in september  richard and philip arrived in sicily after the death of king william ii of sicily his cousin tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in  as king tancred i of sicily although the legal heir was williams aunt constance wife of the new emperor henry vi tancred had imprisoned williams widow queen joan who was richards sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in williams will when richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance she was freed on  september but without the inheritance the presence of foreign troops also caused unrest in october the people of messina revolted demanding that the foreigners leave richard attacked messina capturing it on  october  after looting and burning the city richard established his base there but this created tension between richard and philip augustus he remained there until tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on  march  the treaty was signed by richard philip and tancred its main terms were joan was to receive  ounces  kg of gold as compensation for her inheritance which tancred kept richard officially proclaimed his nephew arthur of brittany son of geoffrey as his heir and tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to arthur when he came of age giving a further  ounces  kg of gold that would be returned by richard if arthur did not marry tancreds daughter the two kings stayed on in sicily for a while but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men with philip augustus plotting with tancred against richard the two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement including the end of richards betrothal to philips sister alys who had supposedly been the mistress of richards father henry ii conquest of cyprusedit the near east in  cyprus in purple in april  richard left messina for acre but a storm dispersed his large fleet after some searching it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister joan and his new fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus along with the wrecks of several other vessels including the treasure ship survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the islands ruler isaac komnenos on  may  richards fleet arrived in the port of lemesos limassol on cyprus he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and treasure isaac refused so richard landed his troops and took limassol various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time in particular guy of lusignan all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat the local magnates abandoned isaac who considered making peace with richard joining him on the crusade and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by richard isaac changed his mind however and tried to escape richards troops led by guy de lusignan conquered the whole island by  june isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons richard named richard de camville and robert of thornham as governors he later sold the island to the master of knights templar robert de sablé and it was subsequently acquired in  by guy of lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom the rapid conquest of the island by richard is more important than it may seem the island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the holy land whose occupation by the christians could not continue without support from the sea cyprus remained a christian stronghold until the battle of lepanto  richards exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island richard left cyprus for acre on  june with his allies marriageedit before leaving cyprus on crusade richard married berengaria of navarre firstborn daughter of king sancho vi of navarre richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native navarre the wedding was held in limassol on  may  at the chapel of st george and was attended by richards sister joan whom he had brought from sicily the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour many feasts and entertainments and public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event among the other grand ceremonies was a double coronation richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus and berengaria queen of england and of cyprus too when richard married berengaria he was still officially betrothed to alys and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the kingdom of navarre as a fief as aquitaine had been for his father further eleanor championed the match as navarre bordered aquitaine thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly though they returned separately berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did and she did not see england until after his death after his release from german captivity richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct but he was not reunited with his wife the marriage remained childless in the holy landedit depiction of richard l and saladin r c – king richard landed at acre on  june  he gave his support to his poitevin vassal guy of lusignan who had brought troops to help him in cyprus guy was the widower of his fathers cousin sibylla of jerusalem and was trying to retain the kingship of jerusalem despite his wifes death during the siege of acre the previous year guys claim was challenged by conrad of montferrat second husband of sibyllas halfsister isabella conrad whose defence of tyre had saved the kingdom in  was supported by philip of france son of his first cousin louis vii of france and by another cousin duke leopold v of austria richard also allied with humphrey iv of toron isabellas first husband from whom she had been forcibly divorced in  humphrey was loyal to guy and spoke arabic fluently so richard used him as a translator and negotiator richard and his forces aided in the capture of acre despite the kings serious illness at one point while sick from scurvy richard is said to have picked off guards on the walls with a crossbow while being carried on a stretcher eventually conrad of montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with saladins forces inside acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city richard quarrelled with leopold v of austria over the deposition of isaac komnenos related to leopolds byzantine mother and his position within the crusade leopolds banner had been raised alongside the english and french standards this was interpreted as arrogance by both richard and philip as leopold was a vassal of the holy roman emperor although he was the highestranking surviving leader of the imperial forces richards men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of acre leopold left the crusade immediately philip also left soon afterwards in poor health and after further disputes with richard over the status of cyprus philip demanded half the island and the kingship of jerusalem richard suddenly found himself without allies richard had kept  muslim prisoners as hostages against saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around acre philip before leaving had entrusted his prisoners to conrad but richard forced him to hand them over to him richard feared his forces being bottled up in acre as he believed his campaign could not advance with the prisoners in train he therefore ordered all the prisoners executed he then moved south defeating saladins forces at the battle of arsuf  miles  km north of jaffa on  september  saladin attempted to harass richards army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail richard maintained his armys defensive formation however until the hospitallers broke ranks to charge the right wing of saladins forces richard then ordered a general counterattack which won the battle arsuf was an important victory the muslim army was not destroyed despite the considerable casualties it suffered but it did rout this was considered shameful by the muslims and boosted the morale of the crusaders in november  following the fall of jaffa the crusader army advanced inland towards jerusalem the army then marched to beit nuba only  miles from jerusalem muslim morale in jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly however the weather was appallingly bad cold with heavy rain and hailstorms this combined with the fear that the crusader army if it besieged jerusalem might be trapped by a relieving force led to the decision to retreat back to the coast richard attempted to negotiate with saladin but this was unsuccessful in the first half of  he and his troops refortified ascalon an election forced richard to accept conrad of montferrat as king of jerusalem and he sold cyprus to his defeated protégé guy only days later on  april  conrad was stabbed to death by hashshashin assassins before he could be crowned eight days later richards own nephew henry ii of champagne was married to the widowed isabella although she was carrying conrads child the murder has never been conclusively solved and richards contemporaries widely suspected his involvement the crusader army made another advance on jerusalem and in june  it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again this time because of dissension amongst its leaders in particular richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force saladin to relinquish jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of egypt the leader of the french contingent the duke of burgundy however was adamant that a direct attack on jerusalem should be made this split the crusader army into two factions and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective richard stated that he would accompany any attack on jerusalem but only as a simple soldier he refused to lead the army without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast there commenced a period of minor skirmishes with saladins forces punctuated by another defeat in the field for the ayyubid army at the battle of jaffa baha aldin a contemporary muslim soldier and biographer of saladin recorded a tribute to richards martial prowess at this battle i have been assured … that on that day the king of england lance in hand rode along the whole length of our army from right to left and not one of our soldiers left the ranks to attack him the sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger… both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable richard knew that both philip and his own brother john were starting to plot against him and the morale of saladins army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats however saladin insisted on the razing of ascalons fortifications which richards men had rebuilt and a few other points richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade egypt—saladins chief supplybase—but failed in the end time ran out for richard he realised that his return could be postponed no longer since both philip and john were taking advantage of his absence he and saladin finally came to a settlement on  september  the terms provided for the destruction of ascalons fortifications allowed christian pilgrims and merchants access to jerusalem and initiated a threeyear truce richard being ill with scurvy left for england on october   captivity ransom and returnedit depiction of richard being pardoned by emperor henry vi c  bad weather forced richards ship to put in at corfu in the lands of the byzantine emperor isaac ii angelos who objected to richards annexation of cyprus formerly byzantine territory disguised as a knight templar richard sailed from corfu with four attendants but his ship was wrecked near aquileia forcing richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central europe on his way to the territory of his brotherinlaw henry the lion richard was captured shortly before christmas  near vienna by leopold v duke of austria who accused richard of arranging the murder of his cousin conrad of montferrat moreover richard had personally offended leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of acre duke leopold kept him prisoner at dürnstein castle under the care of leopolds ministerialis hadmar of kuenring his mishap was soon known to england but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts while in prison richard wrote ja nus hons pris or ja nuls om pres no man who is imprisoned which is addressed to his halfsister marie de champagne he wrote the song in french and occitan versions to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister the detention of a crusader was contrary to public law and on these grounds pope celestine iii excommunicated duke leopold ruins of dürnstein castle where richard was kept captive on  march  richard was brought to speyer and handed over to henry vi holy roman emperor who imprisoned him in trifels castle henry vi was aggrieved by the support the plantagenets had given to the family of henry the lion and by richards recognition of tancred in sicily henry vi needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern italy and continued to hold richard for ransom in response pope celestine iii excommunicated henry vi as he had duke leopold for the continued wrongful imprisonment of richard richard famously refused to show deference to the emperor and declared to him i am born of a rank which recognises no superior but god despite his complaints the conditions of his captivity were not severe the emperor demanded that  marks  pounds of silver be delivered to him before he would release the king the same amount raised by the saladin tithe only a few years earlier and – times the annual income for the english crown under richard eleanor of aquitaine worked to raise the ransom both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes at the same time john richards brother and king philip of france offered  marks for the emperor to hold richard prisoner until michaelmas  the emperor turned down the offer the money to rescue the king was transferred to germany by the emperors ambassadors but at the kings peril had it been lost along the way richard would have been held responsible and finally on  february  richard was released philip sent a message to john look to yourself the devil is loose later years and deathedit in richards absence his brother john revolted with the aid of philip amongst philips conquests in the period of richards imprisonment was normandy richard forgave john when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew arthur richard began his reconquest of normandy the fall of the château de gisors to the french in  opened a gap in the norman defences the search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of normandy and act as a base from which richard could launch his campaign to take back the vexin from french control a naturally defensible position was identified perched high above the river seine an important transport route in the manor of andeli under the terms of the treaty of louviers december  between richard and philip ii neither king was allowed to fortify the site despite this richard intended to build the vast château gaillard richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation walter de coutances archbishop of rouen was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the dioceses most profitable and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war when philip besieged aumale in normandy richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor although the act was opposed by the church the archbishop issued an interdict against performing church services in the duchy of normandy roger of howden detailed unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of normandy the interdict was still in force when work began on the castle but pope celestine iii repealed it in april  after richard made gifts of land to the archibishop and the diocese of rouen including two manors and the prosperous port of dieppe ruins of château gaillard royal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under henry ii attributed to a concentration of resources on richards war with the king of france however the work at château gaillard was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated £ to £ between  and  this was more than double richards spending on castles in england an estimated £ unprecedented in its speed of construction the castle was mostly complete in two years when most construction on such a scale would have taken the best part of a decade according to william of newburgh in may  richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a rain of blood while some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen richard was undeterred as no mastermason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castles construction military historian allen brown has suggested that richard himself was the overall architect this is supported by the interest richard showed in the work through his frequent presence in his final years the castle became richards favourite residence and writs and charters were written at château gaillard bearing apud bellum castrum de rupe at the fair castle of the rock château gaillard was ahead of its time featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later allen brown described château gaillard as one of the finest castles in europe and military historian sir charles oman wrote that it was considered the masterpiece of its time the reputation of its builder coeur de lion as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure he was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the east but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold determined to resist philips designs on contested angevin lands such as the vexin and berry richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into war on the french king he organised an alliance against philip including baldwin ix of flanders renaud count of boulogne and his fatherinlaw king sancho vi of navarre who raided philips lands from the south most importantly he managed to secure the welf inheritance in saxony for his nephew henry the lions son otto of poitou who was elected otto iv of germany in  inverted coat of arms of richard indicating his death from a manuscript of chronica majora by matthew paris th century partly as a result of these and other intrigues richard won several victories over philip at fréteval in  just after richards return to france from captivity and moneyraising in england philip fled leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by richard at the battle of gisors sometimes called courcelles in  richard took dieu et mon droit—god and my right—as his motto still used by the british monarchy today echoing his earlier boast to the emperor henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but god in march  richard was in limousin suppressing a revolt by viscount aimar v of limoges although it was lent he devastated the viscounts land with fire and sword he besieged the puny virtually unarmed castle of châluschabrol some chroniclers claimed that this was because a local peasant had uncovered a treasure trove of roman gold which richard claimed from aimar in his position as feudal overlord in the early evening of  march  richard was walking around the castle perimeter without his chainmail investigating the progress of sappers on the castle walls missiles were occasionally shot from the castle walls but these were given little attention one defender in particular amused the king greatly—a man standing on the walls crossbow in one hand the other clutching a frying pan he had been using all day as a shield to beat off missiles he deliberately aimed at the king which the king applauded however another crossbowman then struck the king in the left shoulder near the neck he tried to pull this out in the privacy of his tent but failed a surgeon called a butcher by howden removed it carelessly mangling the kings arm in the process the wound swiftly became gangrenous richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him called alternatively pierre or peter basile john sabroz dudo and bertrand de gourdon from the town of gourdon by chroniclers the man turned out according to some sources but not all to be a boy he said richard had killed his father and two brothers and that he had killed richard in revenge he expected to be executed but as a final act of mercy richard forgave him saying live on and by my bounty behold the light of day before he ordered the boy to be freed and sent away with  shillings it is unclear whether the kings pardon was upheld following his death richard then set his affairs in order bequeathing all his territory to his brother john and his jewels to his nephew otto tomb containing the heart of king richard at rouen cathedral tomb at fontevraud richard died on  april  in the arms of his mother it was later said that as the day was closing he ended his earthly daycitation needed because of the nature of richards death he was later referred to as the lion that by the ant was slaincitation needed according to one chronicler richards last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain mercadier had the crossbowman flayed alive and hanged as soon as richard died richards heart was buried at rouen in normandy his entrails in châlus where he died and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at fontevraud abbey in anjou in  scientists analysed the remains of richards heart and found that it had been embalmed with various substances including frankincense a symbolically important substance because it had been present both at the birth and embalming of the christ henry sandford bishop of rochester – announced that he had seen a vision of richard ascending to heaven in march  along with stephen langton the former archbishop of canterbury the king having presumably spent  years in purgatory as expiation for his sins richard produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son philip of cognac as a result he was succeeded by his brother john as king of england however his french territories initially rejected john as a successor preferring his nephew arthur of brittany the son of their late brother geoffrey whose claim was by modern standards better than johns the lack of any direct heirs from richard was the first step in the dissolution of the angevin empire character and sexualityedit contemporaries considered richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess this was apparently the first such instance of this combination he was known as a valiant competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous at the same time he was considered prone to the sins of lust pride greed and above all excessive cruelty ralph of coggeshall summarising richards career deplores that the king was one of the immense cohort of sinners he was criticised by clergy chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the crusade and for his ransom whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes in the historiography of the second half of the th century much interest was shown in richards sexuality in particular whether there was cogent evidence of homosexuality the topic had not been raised by victorian or edwardian historians a fact which was itself denounced as a conspiracy of silence by john harvey  the argument primarily drew on accounts of richards behaviour as well as of his confessions and penitences and of his childless marriage richard did have at least one illegitimate child philip of cognac and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns historians remain divided on the question of richards sexuality harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians most notably john gillingham  who argues that richard was probably heterosexual flori  again argued in favour of richards homosexuality based on richards two public confessions and penitences in  and  which according to flori must have referred to the sin of sodomy flori however concedes that contemporary accounts of richard taking women by force exist concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women flori and gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bedsharing do not support the suggestion that richard had a sexual relationship with king philip ii as had been suggested by other modern authors legacyedit heraldryedit further information royal arms of england the three lions of the royal arms of england the second great seal of richard i  shows him bearing a shield depicting three lions passantguardant this is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon which later became established as the royal arms of england it is likely therefore that richard introduced this heraldic design in his earlier great seal of  he had used either one or two lions rampants combatants which arms he may have adopted from his father richard is also credited with having originated the english crest of a lion statant now statantguardant the coat of three lions continues to represent england on several coins of the pound sterling forms the basis of several emblems of english national sports teams such as the england national football team and the teams three lions anthem and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of england medieval folkloreedit main article matter of england richard marrying robin hood and maid marian on a plaque outside nottingham castle around the middle of the th century various legends developed that after richards capture his minstrel blondel travelled europe from castle to castle loudly singing a song known only to the two of them they had composed it together eventually he came to the place where richard was being held and richard heard the song and answered with the appropriate refrain thus revealing where the king was incarcerated the story was the basis of andré ernest modeste grétrys opera richard coeurdelion and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to richard thorpes film version of ivanhoe it seems unconnected to the real jean blondel de nesle an aristocratic trouvère it also does not correspond to the historical reality since the kings jailers did not hide the fact on the contrary they publicised it at some time around the th century tales of robin hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of king richard the lionheart robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of richards evil brother john while richard was away at the third crusade modern receptionedit richard coeur de lion carlo marochettis statue of richard i outside the palace of westminster london richards reputation over the years has fluctuated wildly according to historian john gillingham while contemporary sources emphasize his stern and unforgiving nature and his excessive cruelty his image is already transformed into romance depicting him as generoushearted preux chevalier a few decades after his death richard left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present in large part because of his military exploits and his popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence this is reflected in steven runcimans final verdict of richard i he was a bad son a bad husband and a bad king but a gallant and splendid soldier history of the crusades vol iii meanwhile muslim writers during the crusades period and after wrote of him never have we had to face a bolder or more subtle opponent victorian england was divided on richard many admired him as a crusader and man of god erecting an heroic statue to him outside the houses of parliament the latevictorian scholar william stubbs on the other hand thought him a bad son a bad husband a selfish ruler and a vicious man during his ten years reign he was in england for no more than six months and was totally absent for the last five years stubbs argued that he was a bad king his great exploits his military skill his splendour and extravagance his poetical tastes his adventurous spirit do not serve to cloak his entire want of sympathy or even consideration for his people he was no englishman but it does not follow that he gave to normandy anjou or aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom his ambition was that of a mere warrior he would fight for anything whatever but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for the glory that he sought was that of victory rather than conquest in world war i when british troops commanded by general edmund allenby captured jerusalem the british press printed cartoons of richard the lionheart looking down from the heavens with the caption reading at last my dream has come true general allenby protested against his campaign being presented as a latter day crusade however stating the importance of jerusalem lay in its strategic importance there was no religious impulse in this campaign depictions in modern fictionedit th century portrait of richard the lionheart by merryjoseph blondel richard is one of the most prominent monarchs in british popular culture appearing as a major or minor character in many works of fiction both written and audiovisual as noted above richard appears in connection with robin hood in sir walter scotts novel ivanhoe he is one of the main characters in scotts the talisman set during the third crusade the opera riccardo primo by george frideric handel is based on richards invasion of cyprus richard is a major character in james goldmans the lion in winter which references the alleged homosexual affair between richard and philip ii of france richard was played by sir anthony

of five sons of king henry ii of england and duchess eleanor of aquitaine he was known as richard cœur de lion or richard the lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior he was also known in occitan as oc e no yes and no because of his reputation for terseness by the age of  richard had taken command of his own army putting down rebellions in poitou against his father richard was a central christian commander during the third crusade leading the campaign after the departure of philip ii of france and scoring considerable victories against his muslim counterpart saladin although he did not retake jerusalem from saladin richard spoke both french and occitan he was born in england where he spent his childhood before becoming king however he lived most of his adult life in the duchy of aquitaine in the southwest of france following his accession he spent very little time perhaps as little as six months in england most of his life as king was spent on crusade in captivity or actively defending his lands in france rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies nevertheless he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects he remains one of the few kings of england remembered by his epithet rather than regnal

he was a younger brother of count william ix of poitiers henry the young king and duchess matilda of saxony as the third legitimate son of king henry ii he was not expected to ascend the throne he was also an elder brother of duke geoffrey ii of brittany queen eleanor of castile queen joan of sicily and count john of mortain who succeeded him as king richard was the younger maternal halfbrother of countess marie of champagne and countess alix of blois the eldest son of henry ii and eleanor william died in  before richards birth richard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother his father was angevinnorman and greatgrandson of william the conqueror contemporary historian ralph of diceto traced his familys lineage through matilda of scotland to the anglosaxon kings of england and alfred the great and from there linked them to noah and woden according to angevin legend there was even infernal blood in the family while his father visited his lands from scotland to france richard probably spent his childhood in england his first recorded visit to the european continent was in may  when his mother took him to normandy his wet nurse was hodierna of st albans whom he gave a generous pension after he became king little is known about richards education although he was born in oxford and brought up in england up to his eighth year it is not known to what extent he used or understood english he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in limousin lenga dòc and also in french during his captivity english prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother john to help destroy the authority of richards chancellor william longchamp who was a norman one of the specific charges laid against longchamp by johns supporter hugh bishop of coventry was that he could not speak english this indicates that by the late th century a knowledge of english was expected of those in positions of authority in england richard was said to be very attractive his hair was between red and blond and he was lighteyed with a pale complexion he was apparently of above average height according to clifford brewer he was  feet  inches  m as with his supposed lack of english the question of his stature is one made from a lack of evidence as his remains have been lost since at least the french revolution and his exact height is unknown john his youngest brother by the same father and mother was known to be  feet  inches  m the itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis ricardi a latin prose narrative of the third crusade states that he was tall of elegant build the colour of his hair was between red and gold his limbs were supple and straight he had long arms suited to wielding a sword his long legs matched the rest of his body from an early age he showed significant political and military ability becoming noted for his chivalry and courage as he fought to control the rebellious nobles of his own territory his elder brother henry the young king was crowned king of england during his fathers lifetime marriage alliances were common among medieval royalty they led to political alliances and peace treaties and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each others lands in march  it was arranged that richard would marry one of the daughters of ramon berenguer iv count of barcelona however these arrangements failed and the marriage never took place henry the young king was married to margaret daughter of louis vii of france on  november  despite this alliance between the plantagenets and the capetians the dynasty on the french throne the two houses were sometimes in conflict in  the intercession of pope alexander iii was necessary to secure a truce between them henry ii had conquered brittany and taken control of gisors and the vexin which had been part of margarets dowry early in the s there had been suggestions richard should marry alys countess of the vexin alice fourth daughter of louis vii because of the rivalry between the kings of england and france louis obstructed the marriage a peace treaty was secured in january  and richards betrothal to alys was confirmed henry ii planned to divide his and eleanors territories among their three eldest surviving sons henry would become king of england and have control of anjou maine and normandy richard would inherit aquitaine and poitiers from his mother and geoffrey would become duke of brittany through marriage with constance heir presumptive of conan iv at the ceremony where richards betrothal was confirmed he paid homage to the king of france for aquitaine thus securing ties of vassalage between the two after henry ii fell seriously ill in  he put in place his plan to divide his kingdom although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories in  richard left for aquitaine with his mother and henry ii gave him the duchy of aquitaine at the request of eleanor richard and his mother embarked on a tour of aquitaine in  in an attempt to pacify the locals together they laid the foundation stone of st augustines monastery in limoges in june  richard was formally recognised as the duke of aquitaine when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office the ceremony took place in poitiers and was repeated in limoges where he wore the ring of st valerie who was the personification of aquitaine revolt against henry iiedit main article revolt of – according to ralph of coggeshall henry the young king instigated rebellion against henry ii he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him and to break away from his dependence on henry ii who controlled the purse strings there were rumors that eleanor might have encouraged her sons to revolt against their father henry the young king abandoned his father and left for the french court seeking the protection of louis vii his younger brothers richard and geoffrey soon followed him while the fiveyearold john remained in england louis gave his support to the three sons and even knighted richard tying them together through vassalage jordan fantosme a contemporary poet described the rebellion as a war without love geoffrey de rancons château de taillebourg the castle richard retreated to after henry iis forces captured  knights and  archers who fought for richard when saintes was captured the three brothers made an oath at the french court that they would not make terms with henry ii without the consent of louis vii and the french barons with the support of louis henry the young king attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money one such baron was philip count of flanders who was promised £ and several castles the brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in england robert de beaumont rd earl of leicester joined forces with hugh bigod st earl of norfolk hugh de kevelioc th earl of chester and william i of scotland for a rebellion in suffolk the alliance with louis was initially successful and by july  the rebels were besieging aumale neufmarché and verneuil and hugh de kevelioc had captured dol in brittany richard went to poitou and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father eleanor was captured so richard was left to lead his campaign against henry iis supporters in aquitaine on his own he marched to take la rochelle but was rejected by the inhabitants he withdrew to the city of saintes which he established as a base of operations in the meantime henry ii had raised a very expensive army of more than  mercenaries with which to face the rebellion he marched on verneuil and louis retreated from his forces the army proceeded to recapture dol and subdued brittany at this point henry ii made an offer of peace to his sons on the advice of louis the offer was refused henry iis forces took saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison although richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers he took refuge in château de taillebourg for the rest of the war henry the young king and the count of flanders planned to land in england to assist the rebellion led by the earl of leicester anticipating this henry ii returned to england with  soldiers and his prisoners including eleanor and his sons wives and fiancées but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed william i of scotland and hugh bigod were captured on  and  july respectively henry ii returned to france and raised the siege of rouen where louis vii had been joined by henry the young king after abandoning his plan to invade england louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in september  the treaty of montlouis when henry ii and louis vii made a truce on  september  its terms specifically excluded richard abandoned by louis and wary of facing his fathers army in battle richard went to henry iis court at poitiers on  september and begged for forgiveness weeping and falling at the feet of henry who gave richard the kiss of peace several days later richards brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father the terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict when richard was offered four castles in aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy richard was given control of two castles in poitou and half the income of aquitaine henry the young king was given two castles in normandy and geoffrey was permitted half of brittany eleanor remained henry iis prisoner until his death partly as insurance for richards good behaviour final years of henry iis reignedit a silver denier of richard struck in his capacity as the count of poitiers after the conclusion of the war the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against henry ii began the king travelled to anjou for this purpose and geoffrey dealt with brittany in january  richard was dispatched to aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him the historian john gillingham notes that the chronicle of roger of howden is the main source for richards activities in this period according to the chronicle most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in  days before the outbreak of war while others were to be razed given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles this was not an easy task roger of howden records the twomonth siege of castillonsuragen while the castle was notoriously strong richards siege engines battered the defenders into submission on this campaign richard acquired the name the lion or the lionheart due to his noble brave and fierce leadership  he is referred to as this our lion hic leo noster as early as  in the topographia hibernica of giraldus cambrensis while the byname lionheart le quor de lion is first recorded in ambroises lestoire de la guerre sainte in the context of the accon campaign of  henry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him it was suspected that henry had appropriated princess alys richards betrothed the daughter of louis vii of france by his second wife as his mistress this made a marriage between richard and alys technically impossible in the eyes of the church but henry prevaricated he regarded alyss dowry vexin in the îledefrance as valuable richard was discouraged from renouncing alys because she was the sister of king philip ii of france a close allycitation needed after his failure to overthrow his father richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of aquitaine especially in the territory of gascony the increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in  hoping to dethrone richard the rebels sought the help of his brothers henry and geoffrey the turning point came in the charente valley in the spring of  the welldefended fortress of taillebourg seemed impregnable the castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a threelayer wall richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat the garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked richard he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates where he easily took over the castle in two days richard the lionhearts victory at taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him it also won richard a reputation as a skilled military commander in – richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of angoulême his opponents turned to philip ii of france for support and the fighting spread through the limousin and périgord the excessive cruelty of richards punitive campaigns aroused even more hostility however with support from his father and from the young king richard the lionheart eventually succeeded in bringing the viscount aimar v of limoges and count elie of périgord to terms after richard had subdued his rebellious barons he again challenged his father from  to  the tension between henry and richard grew as king henry commanded richard to pay homage to henry the young king but richard refused finally in  henry the young king and geoffrey duke of brittany invaded aquitaine in an attempt to subdue richard richards barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke however richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies and they executed any prisoners the conflict paused briefly in june  when the young king died with the death of henry the young king richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the english crown king henry demanded that richard give up aquitaine which he planned to give to his youngest son john as his inheritance richard refused and conflict continued between them henry ii soon gave john permission to invade aquitaine to strengthen his position in  richard allied himself with yearold philip ii the son of eleanors exhusband louis vii by adele of champagne roger of howden wrote the king of england was struck with great astonishment and wondered what this alliance could mean and taking precautions for the future frequently sent messengers into france for the purpose of recalling his son richard who pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father made his way to chinon and in spite of the person who had the custody thereof carried off the greater part of his fathers treasures and fortified his castles in poitou with the same refusing to go to his father overall howden is chiefly concerned with the politics of the relationship between richard and king philip gillingham has addressed theories suggesting that this political relationship was also sexually intimate which he posits probably stemmed from an official record announcing that as a symbol of unity between the two countries the kings of england and france had slept overnight in the same bed gillingham has characterized this as an accepted political act nothing sexual about it a bit like a modernday photo opportunity in exchange for philips help against his father richard promised to concede to him his rights to both normandy and anjou richard paid homage to philip in november  with news arriving of the battle of hattin he took the cross at tours in the company of other french nobles in  henry ii planned to concede aquitaine to his youngest son john but richard refused the thought he felt that aquitaine was his and that john was unfit to take over the land once belonging to his beloved mother this refusal is what finally made henry ii bring queen eleanor out of prison he sent her to aquitaine and demanded that richard give up his lands to his mother who would once again rule over those lands the following year richard attempted to take the throne of england for himself by joining philips expedition against his father on  july  the forces of richard and philip defeated henrys army at ballans henry with johns consent agreed to name richard his heir apparent two days later henry ii died in chinon and richard the lionheart succeeded him as king of england duke of normandy and count of anjou roger of howden claimed that henrys corpse bled from the nose in richards presence which was assumed to be a sign that richard had caused his death king and crusaderedit coronation and antijewish violenceedit richard i being anointed during his coronation in westminster abbey from a thcentury chronicle richard i was officially invested as duke of normandy on  july  and crowned king in westminster abbey on  september  richard barred all jews and women from the investiture but some jewish leaders arrived to present gifts for the new king according to ralph of diceto richards courtiers stripped and flogged the jews then flung them out of court when a rumour spread that richard had ordered all jews to be killed the people of london attacked the jewish population many jewish homes were burned down and several jews were forcibly baptised some sought sanctuary in the tower of london and others managed to escape among those killed was jacob of orléans a respected jewish scholar roger of howden in his gesta regis ricardi claimed that the jealous and bigoted citizens started the rioting and that richard punished the perpetrators allowing a forcibly converted jew to return to his native religion baldwin of forde archbishop of canterbury reacted by remarking if the king is not gods man he had better be the devils silver penny of richard i york museums trust realising that the assaults could destabilise his realm on the eve of his departure on crusade richard ordered the execution of those responsible for the most egregious murders and persecutions including rioters who had accidentally burned down christian homes he distributed a royal writ demanding that the jews be left alone the edict was loosely enforced however and the following march further violence occurred including a massacre at york crusade plansedit richard had already taken the cross as count of poitou in  his father and philip ii had done so at gisors on  january  after receiving news of the fall of jerusalem to saladin after richard became king he and philip agreed to go on the third crusade since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross he started to raise and equip a new crusader army he spent most of his fathers treasury filled with money raised by the saladin tithe raised taxes and even agreed to free king william i of scotland from his oath of subservience to richard in exchange for  marks to raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions lands and other privileges to those interested in them those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts william longchamp bishop of ely and the kings chancellor made a show of bidding £ to remain as chancellor he was apparently outbid by a certain reginald the italian but that bid was refused richard made some final arrangements on the continent he reconfirmed his fathers appointment of william fitz ralph to the important post of seneschal of normandy in anjou stephen of tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement payn de rochefort an angevin knight was elevated to the post of seneschal of anjou in poitou the exprovost of benon peter bertin was made seneschal and finally in gascony the household official helie de la celle was picked for the seneschalship there after repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his french possessions richard finally set out on the crusade in summer  his delay was criticised by troubadours such as bertran de born he appointed as regents hugh de puiset bishop of durham and william de mandeville rd earl of essex—who soon died and was replaced by richards chancellor william longchamp richards brother john was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against william when richard was raising funds for his crusade he was said to declare i would have sold london if i could find a buyer occupation of sicilyedit richard and philip of france french manuscript of  in september  richard and philip arrived in sicily after the death of king william ii of sicily his cousin tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in  as king tancred i of sicily although the legal heir was williams aunt constance wife of the new emperor henry vi tancred had imprisoned williams widow queen joan who was richards sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in williams will when richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance she was freed on  september but without the inheritance the presence of foreign troops also caused unrest in october the people of messina revolted demanding that the foreigners leave richard attacked messina capturing it on  october  after looting and burning the city richard established his base there but this created tension between richard and philip augustus he remained there until tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on  march  the treaty was signed by richard philip and tancred its main terms were joan was to receive  ounces  kg of gold as compensation for her inheritance which tancred kept richard officially proclaimed his nephew arthur of brittany son of geoffrey as his heir and tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to arthur when he came of age giving a further  ounces  kg of gold that would be returned by richard if arthur did not marry tancreds daughter the two kings stayed on in sicily for a while but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men with philip augustus plotting with tancred against richard the two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement including the end of richards betrothal to philips sister alys who had supposedly been the mistress of richards father henry ii conquest of cyprusedit the near east in  cyprus in purple in april  richard left messina for acre but a storm dispersed his large fleet after some searching it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister joan and his new fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus along with the wrecks of several other vessels including the treasure ship survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the islands ruler isaac komnenos on  may  richards fleet arrived in the port of lemesos limassol on cyprus he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and treasure isaac refused so richard landed his troops and took limassol various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time in particular guy of lusignan all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat the local magnates abandoned isaac who considered making peace with richard joining him on the crusade and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by richard isaac changed his mind however and tried to escape richards troops led by guy de lusignan conquered the whole island by  june isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons richard named richard de camville and robert of thornham as governors he later sold the island to the master of knights templar robert de sablé and it was subsequently acquired in  by guy of lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom the rapid conquest of the island by richard is more important than it may seem the island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the holy land whose occupation by the christians could not continue without support from the sea cyprus remained a christian stronghold until the battle of lepanto  richards exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island richard left cyprus for acre on  june with his allies marriageedit before leaving cyprus on crusade richard married berengaria of navarre firstborn daughter of king sancho vi of navarre richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native navarre the wedding was held in limassol on  may  at the chapel of st george and was attended by richards sister joan whom he had brought from sicily the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour many feasts and entertainments and public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event among the other grand ceremonies was a double coronation richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus and berengaria queen of england and of cyprus too when richard married berengaria he was still officially betrothed to alys and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the kingdom of navarre as a fief as aquitaine had been for his father further eleanor championed the match as navarre bordered aquitaine thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly though they returned separately berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did and she did not see england until after his death after his release from german captivity richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct but he was not reunited with his wife the marriage remained childless in the holy landedit depiction of richard l and saladin r c – king richard landed at acre on  june  he gave his support to his poitevin vassal guy of lusignan who had brought troops to help him in cyprus guy was the widower of his fathers cousin sibylla of jerusalem and was trying to retain the kingship of jerusalem despite his wifes death during the siege of acre the previous year guys claim was challenged by conrad of montferrat second husband of sibyllas halfsister isabella conrad whose defence of tyre had saved the kingdom in  was supported by philip of france son of his first cousin louis vii of france and by another cousin duke leopold v of austria richard also allied with humphrey iv of toron isabellas first husband from whom she had been forcibly divorced in  humphrey was loyal to guy and spoke arabic fluently so richard used him as a translator and negotiator richard and his forces aided in the capture of acre despite the kings serious illness at one point while sick from scurvy richard is said to have picked off guards on the walls with a crossbow while being carried on a stretcher eventually conrad of montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with saladins forces inside acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city richard quarrelled with leopold v of austria over the deposition of isaac komnenos related to leopolds byzantine mother and his position within the crusade leopolds banner had been raised alongside the english and french standards this was interpreted as arrogance by both richard and philip as leopold was a vassal of the holy roman emperor although he was the highestranking surviving leader of the imperial forces richards men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of acre leopold left the crusade immediately philip also left soon afterwards in poor health and after further disputes with richard over the status of cyprus philip demanded half the island and the kingship of jerusalem richard suddenly found himself without allies richard had kept  muslim prisoners as hostages against saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around acre philip before leaving had entrusted his prisoners to conrad but richard forced him to hand them over to him richard feared his forces being bottled up in acre as he believed his campaign could not advance with the prisoners in train he therefore ordered all the prisoners executed he then moved south defeating saladins forces at the battle of arsuf  miles  km north of jaffa on  september  saladin attempted to harass richards army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail richard maintained his armys defensive formation however until the hospitallers broke ranks to charge the right wing of saladins forces richard then ordered a general counterattack which won the battle arsuf was an important victory the muslim army was not destroyed despite the considerable casualties it suffered but it did rout this was considered shameful by the muslims and boosted the morale of the crusaders in november  following the fall of jaffa the crusader army advanced inland towards jerusalem the army then marched to beit nuba only  miles from jerusalem muslim morale in jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly however the weather was appallingly bad cold with heavy rain and hailstorms this combined with the fear that the crusader army if it besieged jerusalem might be trapped by a relieving force led to the decision to retreat back to the coast richard attempted to negotiate with saladin but this was unsuccessful in the first half of  he and his troops refortified ascalon an election forced richard to accept conrad of montferrat as king of jerusalem and he sold cyprus to his defeated protégé guy only days later on  april  conrad was stabbed to death by hashshashin assassins before he could be crowned eight days later richards own nephew henry ii of champagne was married to the widowed isabella although she was carrying conrads child the murder has never been conclusively solved and richards contemporaries widely suspected his involvement the crusader army made another advance on jerusalem and in june  it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again this time because of dissension amongst its leaders in particular richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force saladin to relinquish jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of egypt the leader of the french contingent the duke of burgundy however was adamant that a direct attack on jerusalem should be made this split the crusader army into two factions and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective richard stated that he would accompany any attack on jerusalem but only as a simple soldier he refused to lead the army without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast there commenced a period of minor skirmishes with saladins forces punctuated by another defeat in the field for the ayyubid army at the battle of jaffa baha aldin a contemporary muslim soldier and biographer of saladin recorded a tribute to richards martial prowess at this battle i have been assured … that on that day the king of england lance in hand rode along the whole length of our army from right to left and not one of our soldiers left the ranks to attack him the sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger… both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable richard knew that both philip and his own brother john were starting to plot against him and the morale of saladins army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats however saladin insisted on the razing of ascalons fortifications which richards men had rebuilt and a few other points richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade egypt—saladins chief supplybase—but failed in the end time ran out for richard he realised that his return could be postponed no longer since both philip and john were taking advantage of his absence he and saladin finally came to a settlement on  september  the terms provided for the destruction of ascalons fortifications allowed christian pilgrims and merchants access to jerusalem and initiated a threeyear truce richard being ill with scurvy left for england on october   captivity ransom and returnedit depiction of richard being pardoned by emperor henry vi c  bad weather forced richards ship to put in at corfu in the lands of the byzantine emperor isaac ii angelos who objected to richards annexation of cyprus formerly byzantine territory disguised as a knight templar richard sailed from corfu with four attendants but his ship was wrecked near aquileia forcing richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central europe on his way to the territory of his brotherinlaw henry the lion richard was captured shortly before christmas  near vienna by leopold v duke of austria who accused richard of arranging the murder of his cousin conrad of montferrat moreover richard had personally offended leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of acre duke leopold kept him prisoner at dürnstein castle under the care of leopolds ministerialis hadmar of kuenring his mishap was soon known to england but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts while in prison richard wrote ja nus hons pris or ja nuls om pres no man who is imprisoned which is addressed to his halfsister marie de champagne he wrote the song in french and occitan versions to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister the detention of a crusader was contrary to public law and on these grounds pope celestine iii excommunicated duke leopold ruins of dürnstein castle where richard was kept captive on  march  richard was brought to speyer and handed over to henry vi holy roman emperor who imprisoned him in trifels castle henry vi was aggrieved by the support the plantagenets had given to the family of henry the lion and by richards recognition of tancred in sicily henry vi needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern italy and continued to hold richard for ransom in response pope celestine iii excommunicated henry vi as he had duke leopold for the continued wrongful imprisonment of richard richard famously refused to show deference to the emperor and declared to him i am born of a rank which recognises no superior but god despite his complaints the conditions of his captivity were not severe the emperor demanded that  marks  pounds of silver be delivered to him before he would release the king the same amount raised by the saladin tithe only a few years earlier and – times the annual income for the english crown under richard eleanor of aquitaine worked to raise the ransom both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes at the same time john richards brother and king philip of france offered  marks for the emperor to hold richard prisoner until michaelmas  the emperor turned down the offer the money to rescue the king was transferred to germany by the emperors ambassadors but at the kings peril had it been lost along the way richard would have been held responsible and finally on  february  richard was released philip sent a message to john look to yourself the devil is loose later years and deathedit in richards absence his brother john revolted with the aid of philip amongst philips conquests in the period of richards imprisonment was normandy richard forgave john when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew arthur richard began his reconquest of normandy the fall of the château de gisors to the french in  opened a gap in the norman defences the search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of normandy and act as a base from which richard could launch his campaign to take back the vexin from french control a naturally defensible position was identified perched high above the river seine an important transport route in the manor of andeli under the terms of the treaty of louviers december  between richard and philip ii neither king was allowed to fortify the site despite this richard intended to build the vast château gaillard richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation walter de coutances archbishop of rouen was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the dioceses most profitable and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war when philip besieged aumale in normandy richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor although the act was opposed by the church the archbishop issued an interdict against performing church services in the duchy of normandy roger of howden detailed unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of normandy the interdict was still in force when work began on the castle but pope celestine iii repealed it in april  after richard made gifts of land to the archibishop and the diocese of rouen including two manors and the prosperous port of dieppe ruins of château gaillard royal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under henry ii attributed to a concentration of resources on richards war with the king of france however the work at château gaillard was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated £ to £ between  and  this was more than double richards spending on castles in england an estimated £ unprecedented in its speed of construction the castle was mostly complete in two years when most construction on such a scale would have taken the best part of a decade according to william of newburgh in may  richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a rain of blood while some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen richard was undeterred as no mastermason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castles construction military historian allen brown has suggested that richard himself was the overall architect this is supported by the interest richard showed in the work through his frequent presence in his final years the castle became richards favourite residence and writs and charters were written at château gaillard bearing apud bellum castrum de rupe at the fair castle of the rock château gaillard was ahead of its time featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later allen brown described château gaillard as one of the finest castles in europe and military historian sir charles oman wrote that it was considered the masterpiece of its time the reputation of its builder coeur de lion as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure he was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the east but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold determined to resist philips designs on contested angevin lands such as the vexin and berry richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into war on the french king he organised an alliance against philip including baldwin ix of flanders renaud count of boulogne and his fatherinlaw king sancho vi of navarre who raided philips lands from the south most importantly he managed to secure the welf inheritance in saxony for his nephew henry the lions son otto of poitou who was elected otto iv of germany in  inverted coat of arms of richard indicating his death from a manuscript of chronica majora by matthew paris th century partly as a result of these and other intrigues richard won several victories over philip at fréteval in  just after richards return to france from captivity and moneyraising in england philip fled leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by richard at the battle of gisors sometimes called courcelles in  richard took dieu et mon droit—god and my right—as his motto still used by the british monarchy today echoing his earlier boast to the emperor henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but god in march  richard was in limousin suppressing a revolt by viscount aimar v of limoges although it was lent he devastated the viscounts land with fire and sword he besieged the puny virtually unarmed castle of châluschabrol some chroniclers claimed that this was because a local peasant had uncovered a treasure trove of roman gold which richard claimed from aimar in his position as feudal overlord in the early evening of  march  richard was walking around the castle perimeter without his chainmail investigating the progress of sappers on the castle walls missiles were occasionally shot from the castle walls but these were given little attention one defender in particular amused the king greatly—a man standing on the walls crossbow in one hand the other clutching a frying pan he had been using all day as a shield to beat off missiles he deliberately aimed at the king which the king applauded however another crossbowman then struck the king in the left shoulder near the neck he tried to pull this out in the privacy of his tent but failed a surgeon called a butcher by howden removed it carelessly mangling the kings arm in the process the wound swiftly became gangrenous richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him called alternatively pierre or peter basile john sabroz dudo and bertrand de gourdon from the town of gourdon by chroniclers the man turned out according to some sources but not all to be a boy he said richard had killed his father and two brothers and that he had killed richard in revenge he expected to be executed but as a final act of mercy richard forgave him saying live on and by my bounty behold the light of day before he ordered the boy to be freed and sent away with  shillings it is unclear whether the kings pardon was upheld following his death richard then set his affairs in order bequeathing all his territory to his brother john and his jewels to his nephew otto tomb containing the heart of king richard at rouen cathedral tomb at fontevraud richard died on  april  in the arms of his mother it was later said that as the day was closing he ended his earthly daycitation needed because of the nature of richards death he was later referred to as the lion that by the ant was slaincitation needed according to one chronicler richards last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain mercadier had the crossbowman flayed alive and hanged as soon as richard died richards heart was buried at rouen in normandy his entrails in châlus where he died and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at fontevraud abbey in anjou in  scientists analysed the remains of richards heart and found that it had been embalmed with various substances including frankincense a symbolically important substance because it had been present both at the birth and embalming of the christ henry sandford bishop of rochester – announced that he had seen a vision of richard ascending to heaven in march  along with stephen langton the former archbishop of canterbury the king having presumably spent  years in purgatory as expiation for his sins richard produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son philip of cognac as a result he was succeeded by his brother john as king of england however his french territories initially rejected john as a successor preferring his nephew arthur of brittany the son of their late brother geoffrey whose claim was by modern standards better than johns the lack of any direct heirs from richard was the first step in the dissolution of the angevin empire character and sexualityedit contemporaries considered richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess this was apparently the first such instance of this combination he was known as a valiant competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous at the same time he was considered prone to the sins of lust pride greed and above all excessive cruelty ralph of coggeshall summarising richards career deplores that the king was one of the immense cohort of sinners he was criticised by clergy chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the crusade and for his ransom whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes in the historiography of the second half of the th century much interest was shown in richards sexuality in particular whether there was cogent evidence of homosexuality the topic had not been raised by victorian or edwardian historians a fact which was itself denounced as a conspiracy of silence by john harvey  the argument primarily drew on accounts of richards behaviour as well as of his confessions and penitences and of his childless marriage richard did have at least one illegitimate child philip of cognac and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns historians remain divided on the question of richards sexuality harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians most notably john gillingham  who argues that richard was probably heterosexual flori  again argued in favour of richards homosexuality based on richards two public confessions and penitences in  and  which according to flori must have referred to the sin of sodomy flori however concedes that contemporary accounts of richard taking women by force exist concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women flori and gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bedsharing do not support the suggestion that richard had a sexual relationship with king philip ii as had been suggested by other modern authors legacyedit heraldryedit further information royal arms of england the three lions of the royal arms of england the second great seal of richard i  shows him bearing a shield depicting three lions passantguardant this is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon which later became established as the

th century various legends developed that after richards capture his minstrel blondel travelled europe from castle to castle loudly singing a song known only to the two of them they had composed it together eventually he came to the place where richard was being held and richard heard the song and answered with the appropriate refrain thus revealing where the king was incarcerated the story was the basis of andré ernest modeste grétrys opera richard coeurdelion and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to richard thorpes film version of ivanhoe it seems unconnected to the real jean blondel de nesle an aristocratic trouvère it also does not correspond to the historical reality since the kings jailers did not hide the fact on the contrary they publicised it at some time around the th century tales of robin hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of king richard the lionheart robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of richards evil brother john while richard was away at the third crusade modern receptionedit richard coeur de lion carlo marochettis statue of richard i outside the palace of westminster london richards reputation over the years has fluctuated wildly according to historian john gillingham while contemporary sources emphasize his stern and unforgiving nature and his excessive cruelty his image is already transformed into romance depicting him as generoushearted preux chevalier a few decades after his death richard left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present in large part because of his military exploits and his popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence this is reflected in steven runcimans final verdict of richard i he was a bad son a bad husband and a bad king but a gallant and splendid soldier history of the crusades vol iii meanwhile muslim writers during the crusades period and after wrote of him never have we had to face a bolder or more subtle opponent victorian england was divided on richard many admired him as a crusader and man of god erecting an heroic statue to him outside the houses of parliament the latevictorian scholar william stubbs on the other hand thought him a bad son a bad husband a selfish ruler and a vicious man during his ten years reign he was in england for no more than six months and was totally absent for the last five years stubbs argued that he was a bad king his great exploits his military skill his splendour and extravagance his poetical tastes his adventurous spirit do not serve to cloak his entire want of sympathy or even consideration for his people he was no englishman but it does not follow that he gave to normandy anjou or aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom his ambition was that of a mere warrior he would fight for anything whatever but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for the glory that he sought was that of victory rather than conquest in world war i when british troops commanded by general edmund allenby captured jerusalem the british press printed cartoons of richard the lionheart looking down from the heavens with the caption reading at last my dream has come true general allenby protested against his campaign being presented as a latter day crusade however stating the importance of jerusalem lay in its strategic importance there was no religious impulse in this campaign depictions in modern fictionedit th century portrait of richard the lionheart by merryjoseph blondel richard is one of the most

of five sons of king henry ii of england and duchess eleanor of aquitaine he was known as richard cœur de lion or richard the lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior he was also known in occitan as oc e no yes and no because of his reputation for terseness by the age of  richard had taken command of his own army putting down rebellions in poitou against his father richard was a central christian commander during the third crusade leading the campaign after the departure of philip ii of france and scoring considerable victories against his muslim counterpart saladin although he did not retake jerusalem from saladin richard spoke both french and occitan he was born in england where he spent his childhood before becoming king however he lived most of his adult life in the duchy of aquitaine in the southwest of france following his accession he spent very little time perhaps as little as six months in england most of his life as king was spent on crusade in captivity or actively defending his lands in france rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies nevertheless he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects he remains one of the few kings of england remembered by his epithet rather than regnal

he was a younger brother of count william ix of poitiers henry the young king and duchess matilda of saxony as the third legitimate son of king henry ii he was not expected to ascend the throne he was also an elder brother of duke geoffrey ii of brittany queen eleanor of castile queen joan of sicily and count john of mortain who succeeded him as king richard was the younger maternal halfbrother of countess marie of champagne and countess alix of blois the eldest son of henry ii and eleanor william died in  before richards birth richard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother his father was angevinnorman and greatgrandson of william the conqueror contemporary historian ralph of diceto traced his familys lineage through matilda of scotland to the anglosaxon kings of england and alfred the great and from there linked them to noah and woden according to angevin legend there was even infernal blood in the family while his father visited his lands from scotland to france richard probably spent his childhood in england his first recorded visit to the european continent was in may  when his mother took him to normandy his wet nurse was hodierna of st albans whom he gave a generous pension after he became king little is known about richards education although he was born in oxford and brought up in england up to his eighth year it is not known to what extent he used or understood english he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in limousin lenga dòc and also in french during his captivity english prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother john to help destroy the authority of richards chancellor william longchamp who was a norman one of the specific charges laid against longchamp by johns supporter hugh bishop of coventry was that he could not speak english this indicates that by the late th century a knowledge of english was expected of those in positions of authority in england richard was said to be very attractive his hair was between red and blond and he was lighteyed with a pale complexion he was apparently of above average height according to clifford brewer he was  feet  inches  m as with his supposed lack of english the question of his stature is one made from a lack of evidence as his remains have been lost since at least the french revolution and his exact height is unknown john his youngest brother by the same father and mother was known to be  feet  inches  m the itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis ricardi a latin prose narrative of the third crusade states that he was tall of elegant build the colour of his hair was between red and gold his limbs were supple and straight he had long arms suited to wielding a sword his long legs matched the rest of his body from an early age he showed significant political and military ability becoming noted for his chivalry and courage as he fought to control the rebellious nobles of his own territory his elder brother henry the young king was crowned king of england during his fathers lifetime marriage alliances were common among medieval royalty they led to political alliances and peace treaties and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each others lands in march  it was arranged that richard would marry one of the daughters of ramon berenguer iv count of barcelona however these arrangements failed and the marriage never took place henry the young king was married to margaret daughter of louis vii of france on  november  despite this alliance between the plantagenets and the capetians the dynasty on the french throne the two houses were sometimes in conflict in  the intercession of pope alexander iii was necessary to secure a truce between them henry ii had conquered brittany and taken control of gisors and the vexin which had been part of margarets dowry early in the s there had been suggestions richard should marry alys countess of the vexin alice fourth daughter of louis vii because of the rivalry between the kings of england and france louis obstructed the marriage a peace treaty was secured in january  and richards betrothal to alys was confirmed henry ii planned to divide his and eleanors territories among their three eldest surviving sons henry would become king of england and have control of anjou maine and normandy richard would inherit aquitaine and poitiers from his mother and geoffrey would become duke of brittany through marriage with constance heir presumptive of conan iv at the ceremony where richards betrothal was confirmed he paid homage to the king of france for aquitaine thus securing ties of vassalage between the two after henry ii fell seriously ill in  he put in place his plan to divide his kingdom although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories in  richard left for aquitaine with his mother and henry ii gave him the duchy of aquitaine at the request of eleanor richard and his mother embarked on a tour of aquitaine in  in an attempt to pacify the locals together they laid the foundation stone of st augustines monastery in limoges in june  richard was formally recognised as the duke of aquitaine when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office the ceremony took place in poitiers and was repeated in limoges where he wore the ring of st valerie who was the personification of aquitaine revolt against henry iiedit main article revolt of – according to ralph of coggeshall henry the young king instigated rebellion against henry ii he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him and to break away from his dependence on henry ii who controlled the purse strings there were rumors that eleanor might have encouraged her sons to revolt against their father henry the young king abandoned his father and left for the french court seeking the protection of louis vii his younger brothers richard and geoffrey soon followed him while the fiveyearold john remained in england louis gave his support to the three sons and even knighted richard tying them together through vassalage jordan fantosme a contemporary poet described the rebellion as a war without love geoffrey de rancons château de taillebourg the castle richard retreated to after henry iis forces captured  knights and  archers who fought for richard when saintes was captured the three brothers made an oath at the french court that they would not make terms with henry ii without the consent of louis vii and the french barons with the support of louis henry the young king attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money one such baron was philip count of flanders who was promised £ and several castles the brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in england robert de beaumont rd earl of leicester joined forces with hugh bigod st earl of norfolk hugh de kevelioc th earl of chester and william i of scotland for a rebellion in suffolk the alliance with louis was initially successful and by july  the rebels were besieging aumale neufmarché and verneuil and hugh de kevelioc had captured dol in brittany richard went to poitou and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father eleanor was captured so richard was left to lead his campaign against henry iis supporters in aquitaine on his own he marched to take la rochelle but was rejected by the inhabitants he withdrew to the city of saintes which he established as a base of operations in the meantime henry ii had raised a very expensive army of more than  mercenaries with which to face the rebellion he marched on verneuil and louis retreated from his forces the army proceeded to recapture dol and subdued brittany at this point henry ii made an offer of peace to his sons on the advice of louis the offer was refused henry iis forces took saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison although richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers he took refuge in château de taillebourg for the rest of the war henry the young king and the count of flanders planned to land in england to assist the rebellion led by the earl of leicester anticipating this henry ii returned to england with  soldiers and his prisoners including eleanor and his sons wives and fiancées but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed william i of scotland and hugh bigod were captured on  and  july respectively henry ii returned to france and raised the siege of rouen where louis vii had been joined by henry the young king after abandoning his plan to invade england louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in september  the treaty of montlouis when henry ii and louis vii made a truce on  september  its terms specifically excluded richard abandoned by louis and wary of facing his fathers army in battle richard went to henry iis court at poitiers on  september and begged for forgiveness weeping and falling at the feet of henry who gave richard the kiss of peace several days later richards brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father the terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict when richard was offered four castles in aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy richard was given control of two castles in poitou and half the income of aquitaine henry the young king was given two castles in normandy and geoffrey was permitted half of brittany eleanor remained henry iis prisoner until his death partly as insurance for richards good behaviour final years of henry iis reignedit a silver denier of richard struck in his capacity as the count of poitiers after the conclusion of the war the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against henry ii began the king travelled to anjou for this purpose and geoffrey dealt with brittany in january  richard was dispatched to aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him the historian john gillingham notes that the chronicle of roger of howden is the main source for richards activities in this period according to the chronicle most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in  days before the outbreak of war while others were to be razed given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles this was not an easy task roger of howden records the twomonth siege of castillonsuragen while the castle was notoriously strong richards siege engines battered the defenders into submission on this campaign richard acquired the name the lion or the lionheart due to his noble brave and fierce leadership  he is referred to as this our lion hic leo noster as early as  in the topographia hibernica of giraldus cambrensis while the byname lionheart le quor de lion is first recorded in ambroises lestoire de la guerre sainte in the context of the accon campaign of  henry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him it was suspected that henry had appropriated princess alys richards betrothed the daughter of louis vii of france by his second wife as his mistress this made a marriage between richard and alys technically impossible in the eyes of the church but henry prevaricated he regarded alyss dowry vexin in the îledefrance as valuable richard was discouraged from renouncing alys because she was the sister of king philip ii of france a close allycitation needed after his failure to overthrow his father richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of aquitaine especially in the territory of gascony the increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in  hoping to dethrone richard the rebels sought the help of his brothers henry and geoffrey the turning point came in the charente valley in the spring of  the welldefended fortress of taillebourg seemed impregnable the castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a threelayer wall richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat the garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked richard he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates where he easily took over the castle in two days richard the lionhearts victory at taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him it also won richard a reputation as a skilled military commander in – richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of angoulême his opponents turned to philip ii of france for support and the fighting spread through the limousin and périgord the excessive cruelty of richards punitive campaigns aroused even more hostility however with support from his father and from the young king richard the lionheart eventually succeeded in bringing the viscount aimar v of limoges and count elie of périgord to terms after richard had subdued his rebellious barons he again challenged his father from  to  the tension between henry and richard grew as king henry commanded richard to pay homage to henry the young king but richard refused finally in  henry the young king and geoffrey duke of brittany invaded aquitaine in an attempt to subdue richard richards barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke however richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies and they executed any prisoners the conflict paused briefly in june  when the young king died with the death of henry the young king richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the english crown king henry demanded that richard give up aquitaine which he planned to give to his youngest son john as his inheritance richard refused and conflict continued between them henry ii soon gave john permission to invade aquitaine to strengthen his position in  richard allied himself with yearold philip ii the son of eleanors exhusband louis vii by adele of champagne roger of howden wrote the king of england was struck with great astonishment and wondered what this alliance could mean and taking precautions for the future frequently sent messengers into france for the purpose of recalling his son richard who pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father made his way to chinon and in spite of the person who had the custody thereof carried off the greater part of his fathers treasures and fortified his castles in poitou with the same refusing to go to his father overall howden is chiefly concerned with the politics of the relationship between richard and king philip gillingham has addressed theories suggesting that this political relationship was also sexually intimate which he posits probably stemmed from an official record announcing that as a symbol of unity between the two countries the kings of england and france had slept overnight in the same bed gillingham has characterized this as an accepted political act nothing sexual about it a bit like a modernday photo opportunity in exchange for philips help against his father richard promised to concede to him his rights to both normandy and anjou richard paid homage to philip in november  with news arriving of the battle of hattin he took the cross at tours in the company of other french nobles in  henry ii planned to concede aquitaine to his youngest son john but richard refused the thought he felt that aquitaine was his and that john was unfit to take over the land once belonging to his beloved mother this refusal is what finally made henry ii bring queen eleanor out of prison he sent her to aquitaine and demanded that richard give up his lands to his mother who would once again rule over those lands the following year richard attempted to take the throne of england for himself by joining philips expedition against his father on  july  the forces of richard and philip defeated henrys army at ballans henry with johns consent agreed to name richard his heir apparent two days later henry ii died in chinon and richard the lionheart succeeded him as king of england duke of normandy and count of anjou roger of howden claimed that henrys corpse bled from the nose in richards presence which was assumed to be a sign that richard had caused his death king and crusaderedit coronation and antijewish violenceedit richard i being anointed during his coronation in westminster abbey from a thcentury chronicle richard i was officially invested as duke of normandy on  july  and crowned king in westminster abbey on  september  richard barred all jews and women from the investiture but some jewish leaders arrived to present gifts for the new king according to ralph of diceto richards courtiers stripped and flogged the jews then flung them out of court when a rumour spread that richard had ordered all jews to be killed the people of london attacked the jewish population many jewish homes were burned down and several jews were forcibly baptised some sought sanctuary in the tower of london and others managed to escape among those killed was jacob of orléans a respected jewish scholar roger of howden in his gesta regis ricardi claimed that the jealous and bigoted citizens started the rioting and that richard punished the perpetrators allowing a forcibly converted jew to return to his native religion baldwin of forde archbishop of canterbury reacted by remarking if the king is not gods man he had better be the devils silver penny of richard i york museums trust realising that the assaults could destabilise his realm on the eve of his departure on crusade richard ordered the execution of those responsible for the most egregious murders and persecutions including rioters who had accidentally burned down christian homes he distributed a royal writ demanding that the jews be left alone the edict was loosely enforced however and the following march further violence occurred including a massacre at york crusade plansedit richard had already taken the cross as count of poitou in  his father and philip ii had done so at gisors on  january  after receiving news of the fall of jerusalem to saladin after richard became king he and philip agreed to go on the third crusade since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross he started to raise and equip a new crusader army he spent most of his fathers treasury filled with money raised by the saladin tithe raised taxes and even agreed to free king william i of scotland from his oath of subservience to richard in exchange for  marks to raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions lands and other privileges to those interested in them those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts william longchamp bishop of ely and the kings chancellor made a show of bidding £ to remain as chancellor he was apparently outbid by a certain reginald the italian but that bid was refused richard made some final arrangements on the continent he reconfirmed his fathers appointment of william fitz ralph to the important post of seneschal of normandy in anjou stephen of tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement payn de rochefort an angevin knight was elevated to the post of seneschal of anjou in poitou the exprovost of benon peter bertin was made seneschal and finally in gascony the household official helie de la celle was picked for the seneschalship there after repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his french possessions richard finally set out on the crusade in summer  his delay was criticised by troubadours such as bertran de born he appointed as regents hugh de puiset bishop of durham and william de mandeville rd earl of essex—who soon died and was replaced by richards chancellor william longchamp richards brother john was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against william when richard was raising funds for his crusade he was said to declare i would have sold london if i could find a buyer occupation of sicilyedit richard and philip of france french manuscript of  in september  richard and philip arrived in sicily after the death of king william ii of sicily his cousin tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in  as king tancred i of sicily although the legal heir was williams aunt constance wife of the new emperor henry vi tancred had imprisoned williams widow queen joan who was richards sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in williams will when richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance she was freed on  september but without the inheritance the presence of foreign troops also caused unrest in october the people of messina revolted demanding that the foreigners leave richard attacked messina capturing it on  october  after looting and burning the city richard established his base there but this created tension between richard and philip augustus he remained there until tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on  march  the treaty was signed by richard philip and tancred its main terms were joan was to receive  ounces  kg of gold as compensation for her inheritance which tancred kept richard officially proclaimed his nephew arthur of brittany son of geoffrey as his heir and tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to arthur when he came of age giving a further  ounces  kg of gold that would be returned by richard if arthur did not marry tancreds daughter the two kings stayed on in sicily for a while but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men with philip augustus plotting with tancred against richard the two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement including the end of richards betrothal to philips sister alys who had supposedly been the mistress of richards father henry ii conquest of cyprusedit the near east in  cyprus in purple in april  richard left messina for acre but a storm dispersed his large fleet after some searching it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister joan and his new fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus along with the wrecks of several other vessels including the treasure ship survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the islands ruler isaac komnenos on  may  richards fleet arrived in the port of lemesos limassol on cyprus he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and treasure isaac refused so richard landed his troops and took limassol various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time in particular guy of lusignan all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat the local magnates abandoned isaac who considered making peace with richard joining him on the crusade and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by richard isaac changed his mind however and tried to escape richards troops led by guy de lusignan conquered the whole island by  june isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons richard named richard de camville and robert of thornham as governors he later sold the island to the master of knights templar robert de sablé and it was subsequently acquired in  by guy of lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom the rapid conquest of the island by richard is more important than it may seem the island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the holy land whose occupation by the christians could not continue without support from the sea cyprus remained a christian stronghold until the battle of lepanto  richards exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island richard left cyprus for acre on  june with his allies marriageedit before leaving cyprus on crusade richard married berengaria of navarre firstborn daughter of king sancho vi of navarre richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native navarre the wedding was held in limassol on  may  at the chapel of st george and was attended by richards sister joan whom he had brought from sicily the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour many feasts and entertainments and public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event among the other grand ceremonies was a double coronation richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus and berengaria queen of england and of cyprus too when richard married berengaria he was still officially betrothed to alys and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the kingdom of navarre as a fief as aquitaine had been for his father further eleanor championed the match as navarre bordered aquitaine thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly though they returned separately berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did and she did not see england until after his death after his release from german captivity richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct but he was not reunited with his wife the marriage remained childless in the holy landedit depiction of richard l and saladin r c – king richard landed at acre on  june  he gave his support to his poitevin vassal guy of lusignan who had brought troops to help him in cyprus guy was the widower of his fathers cousin sibylla of jerusalem and was trying to retain the kingship of jerusalem despite his wifes death during the siege of acre the previous year guys claim was challenged by conrad of montferrat second husband of sibyllas halfsister isabella conrad whose defence of tyre had saved the kingdom in  was supported by philip of france son of his first cousin louis vii of france and by another cousin duke leopold v of austria richard also allied with humphrey iv of toron isabellas first husband from whom she had been forcibly divorced in  humphrey was loyal to guy and spoke arabic fluently so richard used him as a translator and negotiator richard and his forces aided in the capture of acre despite the kings serious illness at one point while sick from scurvy richard is said to have picked off guards on the walls with a crossbow while being carried on a stretcher eventually conrad of montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with saladins forces inside acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city richard quarrelled with leopold v of austria over the deposition of isaac komnenos related to leopolds byzantine mother and his position within the crusade leopolds banner had been raised alongside the english and french standards this was interpreted as arrogance by both richard and philip as leopold was a vassal of the holy roman emperor although he was the highestranking surviving leader of the imperial forces richards men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of acre leopold left the crusade immediately philip also left soon afterwards in poor health and after further disputes with richard over the status of cyprus philip demanded half the island and the kingship of jerusalem richard suddenly found himself without allies richard had kept  muslim prisoners as hostages against saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around acre philip before leaving had entrusted his prisoners to conrad but richard forced him to hand them over to him richard feared his forces being bottled up in acre as he believed his campaign could not advance with the prisoners in train he therefore ordered all the prisoners executed he then moved south defeating saladins forces at the battle of arsuf  miles  km north of jaffa on  september  saladin attempted to harass richards army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail richard maintained his armys defensive formation however until the hospitallers broke ranks to charge the right wing of saladins forces richard then ordered a general counterattack which won the battle arsuf was an important victory the muslim army was not destroyed despite the considerable casualties it suffered but it did rout this was considered shameful by the muslims and boosted the morale of the crusaders in november  following the fall of jaffa the crusader army advanced inland towards jerusalem the army then marched to beit nuba only  miles from jerusalem muslim morale in jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly however the weather was appallingly bad cold with heavy rain and hailstorms this combined with the fear that the crusader army if it besieged jerusalem might be trapped by a relieving force led to the decision to retreat back to the coast richard attempted to negotiate with saladin but this was unsuccessful in the first half of  he and his troops refortified ascalon an election forced richard to accept conrad of montferrat as king of jerusalem and he sold cyprus to his defeated protégé guy only days later on  april  conrad was stabbed to death by hashshashin assassins before he could be crowned eight days later richards own nephew henry ii of champagne was married to the widowed isabella although she was carrying conrads child the murder has never been conclusively solved and richards contemporaries widely suspected his involvement the crusader army made another advance on jerusalem and in june  it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again this time because of dissension amongst its leaders in particular richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force saladin to relinquish jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of egypt the leader of the french contingent the duke of burgundy however was adamant that a direct attack on jerusalem should be made this split the crusader army into two factions and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective richard stated that he would accompany any attack on jerusalem but only as a simple soldier he refused to lead the army without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast there commenced a period of minor skirmishes with saladins forces punctuated by another defeat in the field for the ayyubid army at the battle of jaffa baha aldin a contemporary muslim soldier and biographer of saladin recorded a tribute to richards martial prowess at this battle i have been assured … that on that day the king of england lance in hand rode along the whole length of our army from right to left and not one of our soldiers left the ranks to attack him the sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger… both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable richard knew that both philip and his own brother john were starting to plot against him and the morale of saladins army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats however saladin insisted on the razing of ascalons fortifications which richards men had rebuilt and a few other points richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade egypt—saladins chief supplybase—but failed in the end time ran out for richard he realised that his return could be postponed no longer since both philip and john were taking advantage of his absence he and saladin finally came to a settlement on  september  the terms provided for the destruction of ascalons fortifications allowed christian pilgrims and merchants access to jerusalem and initiated a threeyear truce richard being ill with scurvy left for england on october   captivity ransom and returnedit depiction of richard being pardoned by emperor henry vi c  bad weather forced richards ship to put in at corfu in the lands of the byzantine emperor isaac ii angelos who objected to richards annexation of cyprus formerly byzantine territory disguised as a knight templar richard sailed from corfu with four attendants but his ship was wrecked near aquileia forcing richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central europe on his way to the territory of his brotherinlaw henry the lion richard was captured shortly before christmas  near vienna by leopold v duke of austria who accused richard of arranging the murder of his cousin conrad of montferrat moreover richard had personally offended leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of acre duke leopold kept him prisoner at dürnstein castle under the care of leopolds ministerialis hadmar of kuenring his mishap was soon known to england but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts while in prison richard wrote ja nus hons pris or ja nuls om pres no man who is imprisoned which is addressed to his halfsister marie de champagne he wrote the song in french and occitan versions to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister the detention of a crusader was contrary to public law and on these grounds pope celestine iii excommunicated duke leopold ruins of dürnstein castle where richard was kept captive on  march  richard was brought to speyer and handed over to henry vi holy roman emperor who imprisoned him in trifels castle henry vi was aggrieved by the support the plantagenets had given to the family of henry the lion and by richards recognition of tancred in sicily henry vi needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern italy and continued to hold richard for ransom in response pope celestine iii excommunicated henry vi as he had duke leopold for the continued wrongful imprisonment of richard richard famously refused to show deference to the emperor and declared to him i am born of a rank which recognises no superior but god despite his complaints the conditions of his captivity were not severe the emperor demanded that  marks  pounds of silver be delivered to him before he would release the king the same amount raised by the saladin tithe only a few years earlier and – times the annual income for the english crown under richard eleanor of aquitaine worked to raise the ransom both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes at the same time john richards brother and king philip of france offered  marks for the emperor to hold richard prisoner until michaelmas  the emperor turned down the offer the money to rescue the king was transferred to germany by the emperors ambassadors but at the kings peril had it been lost along the way richard would have been held responsible and finally on  february  richard was released philip sent a message to john look to yourself the devil is loose later years and deathedit in richards absence his brother john revolted with the aid of philip amongst philips conquests in the period of richards imprisonment was normandy richard forgave john when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew arthur richard began his reconquest of normandy the fall of the château de gisors to the french in  opened a gap in the norman defences the search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of normandy and act as a base from which richard could launch his campaign to take back the vexin from french control a naturally defensible position was identified perched high above the river seine an important transport route in the manor of andeli under the terms of the treaty of louviers december  between richard and philip ii neither king was allowed to fortify the site despite this richard intended to build the vast château gaillard richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation walter de coutances archbishop of rouen was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the dioceses most profitable and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war when philip besieged aumale in normandy richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor although the act was opposed by the church the archbishop issued an interdict against performing church services in the duchy of normandy roger of howden detailed unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of normandy the interdict was still in force when work began on the castle but pope celestine iii repealed it in april  after richard made gifts of land to the archibishop and the diocese of rouen including two manors and the prosperous port of dieppe ruins of château gaillard royal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under henry ii attributed to a concentration of resources on richards war with the king of france however the work at château gaillard was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated £ to £ between  and  this was more than double richards spending on castles in england an estimated £ unprecedented in its speed of construction the castle was mostly complete in two years when most construction on such a scale would have taken the best part of a decade according to william of newburgh in may  richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a rain of blood while some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen richard was undeterred as no mastermason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castles construction military historian allen brown has suggested that richard himself was the overall architect this is supported by the interest richard showed in the work through his frequent presence in his final years the castle became richards favourite residence and writs and charters were written at château gaillard bearing apud bellum castrum de rupe at the fair castle of the rock château gaillard was ahead of its time featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later allen brown described château gaillard as one of the finest castles in europe and military historian sir charles oman wrote that it was considered the masterpiece of its time the reputation of its builder coeur de lion as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure he was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the east but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold determined to resist philips designs on contested angevin lands such as the vexin and berry richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into war on the french king he organised an alliance against philip including baldwin ix of flanders renaud count of boulogne and his fatherinlaw king sancho vi of navarre who raided philips lands from the south most importantly he managed to secure the welf inheritance in saxony for his nephew henry the lions son otto of poitou who was elected otto iv of germany in  inverted coat of arms of richard indicating his death from a manuscript of chronica majora by matthew paris th century partly as a result of these and other intrigues richard won several victories over philip at fréteval in  just after richards return to france from captivity and moneyraising in england philip fled leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by richard at the battle of gisors sometimes called courcelles in  richard took dieu et mon droit—god and my right—as his motto still used by the british monarchy today echoing his earlier boast to the emperor henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but god in march  richard was in limousin suppressing a revolt by viscount aimar v of limoges although it was lent he devastated the viscounts land with fire and sword he besieged the puny virtually unarmed castle of châluschabrol some chroniclers claimed that this was because a local peasant had uncovered a treasure trove of roman gold which richard claimed from aimar in his position as feudal overlord in the early evening of  march  richard was walking around the castle perimeter without his chainmail investigating the progress of sappers on the castle walls missiles were occasionally shot from the castle walls but these were given little attention one defender in particular amused the king greatly—a man standing on the walls crossbow in one hand the other clutching a frying pan he had been using all day as a shield to beat off missiles he deliberately aimed at the king which the king applauded however another crossbowman then struck the king in the left shoulder near the neck he tried to pull this out in the privacy of his tent but failed a surgeon called a butcher by howden removed it carelessly mangling the kings arm in the process the wound swiftly became gangrenous richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him called alternatively pierre or peter basile john sabroz dudo and bertrand de gourdon from the town of gourdon by chroniclers the man turned out according to some sources but not all to be a boy he said richard had killed his father and two brothers and that he had killed richard in revenge he expected to be executed but as a final act of mercy richard forgave him saying live on and by my bounty behold the light of day before he ordered the boy to be freed and sent away with  shillings it is unclear whether the kings pardon was upheld following his death richard then set his affairs in order bequeathing all his territory to his brother john and his jewels to his nephew otto tomb containing the heart of king richard at rouen cathedral tomb at fontevraud richard died on  april  in the arms of his mother it was later said that as the day was closing he ended his earthly daycitation needed because of the nature of richards death he was later referred to as the lion that by the ant was slaincitation needed according to one chronicler richards last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain mercadier had the crossbowman flayed alive and hanged as soon as richard died richards heart was buried at rouen in normandy his entrails in châlus where he died and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at fontevraud abbey in anjou in  scientists analysed the remains of richards heart and found that it had been embalmed with various substances including frankincense a symbolically important substance because it had been present both at the birth and embalming of the christ henry sandford bishop of rochester – announced that he had seen a vision of richard ascending to heaven in march  along with stephen langton the former archbishop of canterbury the king having presumably spent  years in purgatory as expiation for his sins richard produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son philip of cognac as a result he was succeeded by his brother john as king of england however his french territories initially rejected john as a successor preferring his nephew arthur of brittany the son of their late brother geoffrey whose claim was by modern standards better than johns the lack of any direct heirs from richard was the first step in the dissolution of the angevin empire character and sexualityedit contemporaries considered richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess this was apparently the first such instance of this combination he was known as a valiant competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous at the same time he was considered prone to the sins of lust pride greed and above all excessive cruelty ralph of coggeshall summarising richards career deplores that the king was one of the immense cohort of sinners he was criticised by clergy chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the crusade and for his ransom whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes in the historiography of the second half of the th century much interest was shown in richards sexuality in particular whether there was cogent evidence of homosexuality the topic had not been raised by victorian or edwardian historians a fact which was itself denounced as a conspiracy of silence by john harvey  the argument primarily drew on accounts of richards behaviour as well as of his confessions and penitences and of his childless marriage richard did have at least one illegitimate child philip of cognac and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns historians remain divided on the question of richards sexuality harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians most notably john gillingham  who argues that richard was probably heterosexual flori  again argued in favour of richards homosexuality based on richards two public confessions and penitences in  and  which according to flori must have referred to the sin of sodomy flori however concedes that contemporary accounts of richard taking women by force exist concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women flori and gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bedsharing do not support the suggestion that richard had a sexual relationship with king philip ii as had been suggested by other modern authors legacyedit heraldryedit further information royal arms of england the three lions of the royal arms of england

th century various legends developed that after richards capture his minstrel blondel travelled europe from castle to castle loudly singing a song known only to the two of them they had composed it together eventually he came to the place where richard was being held and richard heard the song and answered with the appropriate refrain thus revealing where the king was incarcerated the story was the basis of andré ernest modeste grétrys opera richard coeurdelion and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to richard thorpes film version of ivanhoe it seems unconnected to the real jean blondel de nesle an aristocratic trouvère it also does not correspond to the historical reality since the kings jailers did not hide the fact on the contrary they publicised it at some time around the th century tales of robin hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of king richard the lionheart robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of richards evil brother john while richard was away at the third crusade modern receptionedit richard coeur de lion carlo marochettis statue of richard i outside the palace of westminster london richards reputation over the years has fluctuated wildly according to historian john gillingham while contemporary sources emphasize his stern and unforgiving nature and his excessive cruelty his image is already transformed into romance depicting him as generoushearted preux chevalier a few decades after his death richard left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present in large part because of his military exploits and his popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence this is reflected in steven runcimans final verdict of richard i he was a bad son a bad husband and a bad king but a gallant and splendid soldier history of the crusades vol iii meanwhile muslim writers during the crusades period and after wrote of him never have we had to face a bolder or more subtle opponent victorian england was divided on richard many admired him as a crusader and man of god erecting an heroic statue to him outside the houses of parliament the latevictorian scholar william stubbs on the other hand thought him a bad son a bad husband a selfish ruler and a vicious man during his ten years reign he was in england for no more than six months and was totally absent for the last five years stubbs argued that he was a bad king his great exploits his military skill his splendour and extravagance his poetical tastes his adventurous spirit do not serve to cloak his entire want of sympathy or even consideration for his people he was no englishman but it does not follow that he gave to normandy anjou or aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom his ambition was that of a mere warrior he would fight for anything whatever but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for the glory that he sought was that of victory rather than conquest in world war i when british troops commanded by general edmund allenby captured jerusalem the british press printed cartoons of richard the lionheart looking down from the heavens with the caption reading at last my dream has come true general allenby protested against his campaign being presented as a latter day crusade however stating the importance of jerusalem lay in its strategic importance there was no religious impulse in this campaign depictions in modern fictionedit th century portrait of richard the lionheart by merryjoseph blondel richard is one of the most

death he also ruled as duke of normandy aquitaine and gascony lord of cyprus count of poitiers anjou maine and nantes and overlord of brittany at various times during the same period he was the third of five sons of king henry ii of england and duchess eleanor of aquitaine he was known as richard cœur de lion or richard the lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior he was also known in occitan as oc e no yes and no because of his reputation for terseness by the age of  richard had taken command of his own army putting down rebellions in poitou against his father richard was a central christian commander during the third crusade leading the campaign after the departure of philip ii of france and scoring considerable victories against his muslim counterpart saladin although he did not retake jerusalem from saladin richard spoke both french and occitan he was born in england where he spent his childhood before becoming king however he lived most of his adult life in the duchy of aquitaine in the southwest of france following his accession he spent very little time perhaps as little as six months in england most of his life as king was spent on crusade in captivity or actively defending his lands in france rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies nevertheless he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects he remains one of the few kings of england remembered by his epithet rather than regnal

he was a younger brother of count william ix of poitiers henry the young king and duchess matilda of saxony as the third legitimate son of king henry ii he was not expected to ascend the throne he was also an elder brother of duke geoffrey ii of brittany queen eleanor of castile queen joan of sicily and count john of mortain who succeeded him as king richard was the younger maternal halfbrother of countess marie of champagne and countess alix of blois the eldest son of henry ii and eleanor william died in  before richards birth richard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother his father was angevinnorman and greatgrandson of william the conqueror contemporary historian ralph of diceto traced his familys lineage through matilda of scotland to the anglosaxon kings of england and alfred the great and from there linked them to noah and woden according to angevin legend there was even infernal blood in the family while his father visited his lands from scotland to france richard probably spent his childhood in england his first recorded visit to the european continent was in may  when his mother took him to normandy his wet nurse was hodierna of st albans whom he gave a generous pension after he became king little is known about richards education although he was born in oxford and brought up in england up to his eighth year it is not known to what extent he used or understood english he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in limousin lenga dòc and also in french during his captivity english prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother john to help destroy the authority of richards chancellor william longchamp who was a norman one of the specific charges laid against longchamp by johns supporter hugh bishop of coventry was that he could not speak english this indicates that by the late th century a knowledge of english was expected of those in positions of authority in england richard was said to be very attractive his hair was between red and blond and he was lighteyed with a pale complexion he was apparently of above average height according to clifford brewer he was  feet  inches  m as with his supposed lack of english the question of his stature is one made from a lack of evidence as his remains have been lost since at least the french revolution and his exact height is unknown john his youngest brother by the same father and mother was known to be  feet  inches  m the itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis ricardi a latin prose narrative of the third crusade states that he was tall of elegant build the colour of his hair was between red and gold his limbs were supple and straight he had long arms suited to wielding a sword his long legs matched the rest of his body from an early age he showed significant political and military ability becoming noted for his chivalry and courage as he fought to control the rebellious nobles of his own territory his elder brother henry the young king was crowned king of england during his fathers lifetime marriage alliances were common among medieval royalty they led to political alliances and peace treaties and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each others lands in march  it was arranged that richard would marry one of the daughters of ramon berenguer iv count of barcelona however these arrangements failed and the marriage never took place henry the young king was married to margaret daughter of louis vii of france on  november  despite this alliance between the plantagenets and the capetians the dynasty on the french throne the two houses were sometimes in conflict in  the intercession of pope alexander iii was necessary to secure a truce between them henry ii had conquered brittany and taken control of gisors and the vexin which had been part of margarets dowry early in the s there had been suggestions richard should marry alys countess of the vexin alice fourth daughter of louis vii because of the rivalry between the kings of england and france louis obstructed the marriage a peace treaty was secured in january  and richards betrothal to alys was confirmed henry ii planned to divide his and eleanors territories among their three eldest surviving sons henry would become king of england and have control of anjou maine and normandy richard would inherit aquitaine and poitiers from his mother and geoffrey would become duke of brittany through marriage with constance heir presumptive of conan iv at the ceremony where richards betrothal was confirmed he paid homage to the king of france for aquitaine thus securing ties of vassalage between the two after henry ii fell seriously ill in  he put in place his plan to divide his kingdom although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories in  richard left for aquitaine with his mother and henry ii gave him the duchy of aquitaine at the request of eleanor richard and his mother embarked on a tour of aquitaine in  in an attempt to pacify the locals together they laid the foundation stone of st augustines monastery in limoges in june  richard was formally recognised as the duke of aquitaine when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office the ceremony took place in poitiers and was repeated in limoges where he wore the ring of st valerie who was the personification of aquitaine revolt against henry iiedit main article revolt of – according to ralph of coggeshall henry the young king instigated rebellion against henry ii he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him and to break away from his dependence on henry ii who controlled the purse strings there were rumors that eleanor might have encouraged her sons to revolt against their father henry the young king abandoned his father and left for the french court seeking the protection of louis vii his younger brothers richard and geoffrey soon followed him while the fiveyearold john remained in england louis gave his support to the three sons and even knighted richard tying them together through vassalage jordan fantosme a contemporary poet described the rebellion as a war without love geoffrey de rancons château de taillebourg the castle richard retreated to after henry iis forces captured  knights and  archers who fought for richard when saintes was captured the three brothers made an oath at the french court that they would not make terms with henry ii without the consent of louis vii and the french barons with the support of louis henry the young king attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money one such baron was philip count of flanders who was promised £ and several castles the brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in england robert de beaumont rd earl of leicester joined forces with hugh bigod st earl of norfolk hugh de kevelioc th earl of chester and william i of scotland for a rebellion in suffolk the alliance with louis was initially successful and by july  the rebels were besieging aumale neufmarché and verneuil and hugh de kevelioc had captured dol in brittany richard went to poitou and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father eleanor was captured so richard was left to lead his campaign against henry iis supporters in aquitaine on his own he marched to take la rochelle but was rejected by the inhabitants he withdrew to the city of saintes which he established as a base of operations in the meantime henry ii had raised a very expensive army of more than  mercenaries with which to face the rebellion he marched on verneuil and louis retreated from his forces the army proceeded to recapture dol and subdued brittany at this point henry ii made an offer of peace to his sons on the advice of louis the offer was refused henry iis forces took saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison although richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers he took refuge in château de taillebourg for the rest of the war henry the young king and the count of flanders planned to land in england to assist the rebellion led by the earl of leicester anticipating this henry ii returned to england with  soldiers and his prisoners including eleanor and his sons wives and fiancées but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed william i of scotland and hugh bigod were captured on  and  july respectively henry ii returned to france and raised the siege of rouen where louis vii had been joined by henry the young king after abandoning his plan to invade england louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in september  the treaty of montlouis when henry ii and louis vii made a truce on  september  its terms specifically excluded richard abandoned by louis and wary of facing his fathers army in battle richard went to henry iis court at poitiers on  september and begged for forgiveness weeping and falling at the feet of henry who gave richard the kiss of peace several days later richards brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father the terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict when richard was offered four castles in aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy richard was given control of two castles in poitou and half the income of aquitaine henry the young king was given two castles in normandy and geoffrey was permitted half of brittany eleanor remained henry iis prisoner until his death partly as insurance for richards good behaviour final years of henry iis reignedit a silver denier of richard struck in his capacity as the count of poitiers after the conclusion of the war the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against henry ii began the king travelled to anjou for this purpose and geoffrey dealt with brittany in january  richard was dispatched to aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him the historian john gillingham notes that the chronicle of roger of howden is the main source for richards activities in this period according to the chronicle most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in  days before the outbreak of war while others were to be razed given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles this was not an easy task roger of howden records the twomonth siege of castillonsuragen while the castle was notoriously strong richards siege engines battered the defenders into submission on this campaign richard acquired the name the lion or the lionheart due to his noble brave and fierce leadership  he is referred to as this our lion hic leo noster as early as  in the topographia hibernica of giraldus cambrensis while the byname lionheart le quor de lion is first recorded in ambroises lestoire de la guerre sainte in the context of the accon campaign of  henry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him it was suspected that henry had appropriated princess alys richards betrothed the daughter of louis vii of france by his second wife as his mistress this made a marriage between richard and alys technically impossible in the eyes of the church but henry prevaricated he regarded alyss dowry vexin in the îledefrance as valuable richard was discouraged from renouncing alys because she was the sister of king philip ii of france a close allycitation needed after his failure to overthrow his father richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of aquitaine especially in the territory of gascony the increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in  hoping to dethrone richard the rebels sought the help of his brothers henry and geoffrey the turning point came in the charente valley in the spring of  the welldefended fortress of taillebourg seemed impregnable the castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a threelayer wall richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat the garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked richard he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates where he easily took over the castle in two days richard the lionhearts victory at taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him it also won richard a reputation as a skilled military commander in – richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of angoulême his opponents turned to philip ii of france for support and the fighting spread through the limousin and périgord the excessive cruelty of richards punitive campaigns aroused even more hostility however with support from his father and from the young king richard the lionheart eventually succeeded in bringing the viscount aimar v of limoges and count elie of périgord to terms after richard had subdued his rebellious barons he again challenged his father from  to  the tension between henry and richard grew as king henry commanded richard to pay homage to henry the young king but richard refused finally in  henry the young king and geoffrey duke of brittany invaded aquitaine in an attempt to subdue richard richards barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke however richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies and they executed any prisoners the conflict paused briefly in june  when the young king died with the death of henry the young king richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the english crown king henry demanded that richard give up aquitaine which he planned to give to his youngest son john as his inheritance richard refused and conflict continued between them henry ii soon gave john permission to invade aquitaine to strengthen his position in  richard allied himself with yearold philip ii the son of eleanors exhusband louis vii by adele of champagne roger of howden wrote the king of england was struck with great astonishment and wondered what this alliance could mean and taking precautions for the future frequently sent messengers into france for the purpose of recalling his son richard who pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father made his way to chinon and in spite of the person who had the custody thereof carried off the greater part of his fathers treasures and fortified his castles in poitou with the same refusing to go to his father overall howden is chiefly concerned with the politics of the relationship between richard and king philip gillingham has addressed theories suggesting that this political relationship was also sexually intimate which he posits probably stemmed from an official record announcing that as a symbol of unity between the two countries the kings of england and france had slept overnight in the same bed gillingham has characterized this as an accepted political act nothing sexual about it a bit like a modernday photo opportunity in exchange for philips help against his father richard promised to concede to him his rights to both normandy and anjou richard paid homage to philip in november  with news arriving of the battle of hattin he took the cross at tours in the company of other french nobles in  henry ii planned to concede aquitaine to his youngest son john but richard refused the thought he felt that aquitaine was his and that john was unfit to take over the land once belonging to his beloved mother this refusal is what finally made henry ii bring queen eleanor out of prison he sent her to aquitaine and demanded that richard give up his lands to his mother who would once again rule over those lands the following year richard attempted to take the throne of england for himself by joining philips expedition against his father on  july  the forces of richard and philip defeated henrys army at ballans henry with johns consent agreed to name richard his heir apparent two days later henry ii died in chinon and richard the lionheart succeeded him as king of england duke of normandy and count of anjou roger of howden claimed that henrys corpse bled from the nose in richards presence which was assumed to be a sign that richard had caused his death king and crusaderedit coronation and antijewish violenceedit richard i being anointed during his coronation in westminster abbey from a thcentury chronicle richard i was officially invested as duke of normandy on  july  and crowned king in westminster abbey on  september  richard barred all jews and women from the investiture but some jewish leaders arrived to present gifts for the new king according to ralph of diceto richards courtiers stripped and flogged the jews then flung them out of court when a rumour spread that richard had ordered all jews to be killed the people of london attacked the jewish population many jewish homes were burned down and several jews were forcibly baptised some sought sanctuary in the tower of london and others managed to escape among those killed was jacob of orléans a respected jewish scholar roger of howden in his gesta regis ricardi claimed that the jealous and bigoted citizens started the rioting and that richard punished the perpetrators allowing a forcibly converted jew to return to his native religion baldwin of forde archbishop of canterbury reacted by remarking if the king is not gods man he had better be the devils silver penny of richard i york museums trust realising that the assaults could destabilise his realm on the eve of his departure on crusade richard ordered the execution of those responsible for the most egregious murders and persecutions including rioters who had accidentally burned down christian homes he distributed a royal writ demanding that the jews be left alone the edict was loosely enforced however and the following march further violence occurred including a massacre at york crusade plansedit richard had already taken the cross as count of poitou in  his father and philip ii had done so at gisors on  january  after receiving news of the fall of jerusalem to saladin after richard became king he and philip agreed to go on the third crusade since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross he started to raise and equip a new crusader army he spent most of his fathers treasury filled with money raised by the saladin tithe raised taxes and even agreed to free king william i of scotland from his oath of subservience to richard in exchange for  marks to raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions lands and other privileges to those interested in them those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts william longchamp bishop of ely and the kings chancellor made a show of bidding £ to remain as chancellor he was apparently outbid by a certain reginald the italian but that bid was refused richard made some final arrangements on the continent he reconfirmed his fathers appointment of william fitz ralph to the important post of seneschal of normandy in anjou stephen of tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement payn de rochefort an angevin knight was elevated to the post of seneschal of anjou in poitou the exprovost of benon peter bertin was made seneschal and finally in gascony the household official helie de la celle was picked for the seneschalship there after repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his french possessions richard finally set out on the crusade in summer  his delay was criticised by troubadours such as bertran de born he appointed as regents hugh de puiset bishop of durham and william de mandeville rd earl of essex—who soon died and was replaced by richards chancellor william longchamp richards brother john was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against william when richard was raising funds for his crusade he was said to declare i would have sold london if i could find a buyer occupation of sicilyedit richard and philip of france french manuscript of  in september  richard and philip arrived in sicily after the death of king william ii of sicily his cousin tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in  as king tancred i of sicily although the legal heir was williams aunt constance wife of the new emperor henry vi tancred had imprisoned williams widow queen joan who was richards sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in williams will when richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance she was freed on  september but without the inheritance the presence of foreign troops also caused unrest in october the people of messina revolted demanding that the foreigners leave richard attacked messina capturing it on  october  after looting and burning the city richard established his base there but this created tension between richard and philip augustus he remained there until tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on  march  the treaty was signed by richard philip and tancred its main terms were joan was to receive  ounces  kg of gold as compensation for her inheritance which tancred kept richard officially proclaimed his nephew arthur of brittany son of geoffrey as his heir and tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to arthur when he came of age giving a further  ounces  kg of gold that would be returned by richard if arthur did not marry tancreds daughter the two kings stayed on in sicily for a while but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men with philip augustus plotting with tancred against richard the two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement including the end of richards betrothal to philips sister alys who had supposedly been the mistress of richards father henry ii conquest of cyprusedit the near east in  cyprus in purple in april  richard left messina for acre but a storm dispersed his large fleet after some searching it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister joan and his new fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus along with the wrecks of several other vessels including the treasure ship survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the islands ruler isaac komnenos on  may  richards fleet arrived in the port of lemesos limassol on cyprus he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and treasure isaac refused so richard landed his troops and took limassol various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time in particular guy of lusignan all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat the local magnates abandoned isaac who considered making peace with richard joining him on the crusade and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by richard isaac changed his mind however and tried to escape richards troops led by guy de lusignan conquered the whole island by  june isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons richard named richard de camville and robert of thornham as governors he later sold the island to the master of knights templar robert de sablé and it was subsequently acquired in  by guy of lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom the rapid conquest of the island by richard is more important than it may seem the island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the holy land whose occupation by the christians could not continue without support from the sea cyprus remained a christian stronghold until the battle of lepanto  richards exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island richard left cyprus for acre on  june with his allies marriageedit before leaving cyprus on crusade richard married berengaria of navarre firstborn daughter of king sancho vi of navarre richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native navarre the wedding was held in limassol on  may  at the chapel of st george and was attended by richards sister joan whom he had brought from sicily the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour many feasts and entertainments and public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event among the other grand ceremonies was a double coronation richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus and berengaria queen of england and of cyprus too when richard married berengaria he was still officially betrothed to alys and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the kingdom of navarre as a fief as aquitaine had been for his father further eleanor championed the match as navarre bordered aquitaine thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly though they returned separately berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did and she did not see england until after his death after his release from german captivity richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct but he was not reunited with his wife the marriage remained childless in the holy landedit depiction of richard l and saladin r c – king richard landed at acre on  june  he gave his support to his poitevin vassal guy of lusignan who had brought troops to help him in cyprus guy was the widower of his fathers cousin sibylla of jerusalem and was trying to retain the kingship of jerusalem despite his wifes death during the siege of acre the previous year guys claim was challenged by conrad of montferrat second husband of sibyllas halfsister isabella conrad whose defence of tyre had saved the kingdom in  was supported by philip of france son of his first cousin louis vii of france and by another cousin duke leopold v of austria richard also allied with humphrey iv of toron isabellas first husband from whom she had been forcibly divorced in  humphrey was loyal to guy and spoke arabic fluently so richard used him as a translator and negotiator richard and his forces aided in the capture of acre despite the kings serious illness at one point while sick from scurvy richard is said to have picked off guards on the walls with a crossbow while being carried on a stretcher eventually conrad of montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with saladins forces inside acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city richard quarrelled with leopold v of austria over the deposition of isaac komnenos related to leopolds byzantine mother and his position within the crusade leopolds banner had been raised alongside the english and french standards this was interpreted as arrogance by both richard and philip as leopold was a vassal of the holy roman emperor although he was the highestranking surviving leader of the imperial forces richards men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of acre leopold left the crusade immediately philip also left soon afterwards in poor health and after further disputes with richard over the status of cyprus philip demanded half the island and the kingship of jerusalem richard suddenly found himself without allies richard had kept  muslim prisoners as hostages against saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around acre philip before leaving had entrusted his prisoners to conrad but richard forced him to hand them over to him richard feared his forces being bottled up in acre as he believed his campaign could not advance with the prisoners in train he therefore ordered all the prisoners executed he then moved south defeating saladins forces at the battle of arsuf  miles  km north of jaffa on  september  saladin attempted to harass richards army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail richard maintained his armys defensive formation however until the hospitallers broke ranks to charge the right wing of saladins forces richard then ordered a general counterattack which won the battle arsuf was an important victory the muslim army was not destroyed despite the considerable casualties it suffered but it did rout this was considered shameful by the muslims and boosted the morale of the crusaders in november  following the fall of jaffa the crusader army advanced inland towards jerusalem the army then marched to beit nuba only  miles from jerusalem muslim morale in jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly however the weather was appallingly bad cold with heavy rain and hailstorms this combined with the fear that the crusader army if it besieged jerusalem might be trapped by a relieving force led to the decision to retreat back to the coast richard attempted to negotiate with saladin but this was unsuccessful in the first half of  he and his troops refortified ascalon an election forced richard to accept conrad of montferrat as king of jerusalem and he sold cyprus to his defeated protégé guy only days later on  april  conrad was stabbed to death by hashshashin assassins before he could be crowned eight days later richards own nephew henry ii of champagne was married to the widowed isabella although she was carrying conrads child the murder has never been conclusively solved and richards contemporaries widely suspected his involvement the crusader army made another advance on jerusalem and in june  it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again this time because of dissension amongst its leaders in particular richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force saladin to relinquish jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of egypt the leader of the french contingent the duke of burgundy however was adamant that a direct attack on jerusalem should be made this split the crusader army into two factions and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective richard stated that he would accompany any attack on jerusalem but only as a simple soldier he refused to lead the army without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast there commenced a period of minor skirmishes with saladins forces punctuated by another defeat in the field for the ayyubid army at the battle of jaffa baha aldin a contemporary muslim soldier and biographer of saladin recorded a tribute to richards martial prowess at this battle i have been assured … that on that day the king of england lance in hand rode along the whole length of our army from right to left and not one of our soldiers left the ranks to attack him the sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger… both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable richard knew that both philip and his own brother john were starting to plot against him and the morale of saladins army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats however saladin insisted on the razing of ascalons fortifications which richards men had rebuilt and a few other points richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade egypt—saladins chief supplybase—but failed in the end time ran out for richard he realised that his return could be postponed no longer since both philip and john were taking advantage of his absence he and saladin finally came to a settlement on  september  the terms provided for the destruction of ascalons fortifications allowed christian pilgrims and merchants access to jerusalem and initiated a threeyear truce richard being ill with scurvy left for england on october   captivity ransom and returnedit depiction of richard being pardoned by emperor henry vi c  bad weather forced richards ship to put in at corfu in the lands of the byzantine emperor isaac ii angelos who objected to richards annexation of cyprus formerly byzantine territory disguised as a knight templar richard sailed from corfu with four attendants but his ship was wrecked near aquileia forcing richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central europe on his way to the territory of his brotherinlaw henry the lion richard was captured shortly before christmas  near vienna by leopold v duke of austria who accused richard of arranging the murder of his cousin conrad of montferrat moreover richard had personally offended leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of acre duke leopold kept him prisoner at dürnstein castle under the care of leopolds ministerialis hadmar of kuenring his mishap was soon known to england but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts while in prison richard wrote ja nus hons pris or ja nuls om pres no man who is imprisoned which is addressed to his halfsister marie de champagne he wrote the song in french and occitan versions to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister the detention of a crusader was contrary to public law and on these grounds pope celestine iii excommunicated duke leopold ruins of dürnstein castle where richard was kept captive on  march  richard was brought to speyer and handed over to henry vi holy roman emperor who imprisoned him in trifels castle henry vi was aggrieved by the support the plantagenets had given to the family of henry the lion and by richards recognition of tancred in sicily henry vi needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern italy and continued to hold richard for ransom in response pope celestine iii excommunicated henry vi as he had duke leopold for the continued wrongful imprisonment of richard richard famously refused to show deference to the emperor and declared to him i am born of a rank which recognises no superior but god despite his complaints the conditions of his captivity were not severe the emperor demanded that  marks  pounds of silver be delivered to him before he would release the king the same amount raised by the saladin tithe only a few years earlier and – times the annual income for the english crown under richard eleanor of aquitaine worked to raise the ransom both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes at the same time john richards brother and king philip of france offered  marks for the emperor to hold richard prisoner until michaelmas  the emperor turned down the offer the money to rescue the king was transferred to germany by the emperors ambassadors but at the kings peril had it been lost along the way richard would have been held responsible and finally on  february  richard was released philip sent a message to john look to yourself the devil is loose later years and deathedit in richards absence his brother john revolted with the aid of philip amongst philips conquests in the period of richards imprisonment was normandy richard forgave john when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew arthur richard began his reconquest of normandy the fall of the château de gisors to the french in  opened a gap in the norman defences the search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of normandy and act as a base from which richard could launch his campaign to take back the vexin from french control a naturally defensible position was identified perched high above the river seine an important transport route in the manor of andeli under the terms of the treaty of louviers december  between richard and philip ii neither king was allowed to fortify the site despite this richard intended to build the vast château gaillard richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation walter de coutances archbishop of rouen was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the dioceses most profitable and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war when philip besieged aumale in normandy richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor although the act was opposed by the church the archbishop issued an interdict against performing church services in the duchy of normandy roger of howden detailed unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of normandy the interdict was still in force when work began on the castle but pope celestine iii repealed it in april  after richard made gifts of land to the archibishop and the diocese of rouen including two manors and the prosperous port of dieppe ruins of château gaillard royal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under henry ii attributed to a concentration of resources on richards war with the king of france however the work at château gaillard was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated £ to £ between  and  this was more than double richards spending on castles in england an estimated £ unprecedented in its speed of construction the castle was mostly complete in two years when most construction on such a scale would have taken the best part of a decade according to william of newburgh in may  richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a rain of blood while some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen richard was undeterred as no mastermason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castles construction military historian allen brown has suggested that richard himself was the overall architect this is supported by the interest richard showed in the work through his frequent presence in his final years the castle became richards favourite residence and writs and charters were written at château gaillard bearing apud bellum castrum de rupe at the fair castle of the rock château gaillard was ahead of its time featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later allen brown described château gaillard as one of the finest castles in europe and military historian sir charles oman wrote that it was considered the masterpiece of its time the reputation of its builder coeur de lion as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure he was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the east but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold determined to resist philips designs on contested angevin lands such as the vexin and berry richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into war on the french king he organised an alliance against philip including baldwin ix of flanders renaud count of boulogne and his fatherinlaw king sancho vi of navarre who raided philips lands from the south most importantly he managed to secure the welf inheritance in saxony for his nephew henry the lions son otto of poitou who was elected otto iv of germany in  inverted coat of arms of richard indicating his death from a manuscript of chronica majora by matthew paris th century partly as a result of these and other intrigues richard won several victories over philip at fréteval in  just after richards return to france from captivity and moneyraising in england philip fled leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by richard at the battle of gisors sometimes called courcelles in  richard took dieu et mon droit—god and my right—as his motto still used by the british monarchy today echoing his earlier boast to the emperor henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but god in march  richard was in limousin suppressing a revolt by viscount aimar v of limoges although it was lent he devastated the viscounts land with fire and sword he besieged the puny virtually unarmed castle of châluschabrol some chroniclers claimed that this was because a local peasant had uncovered a treasure trove of roman gold which richard claimed from aimar in his position as feudal overlord in the early evening of  march  richard was walking around the castle perimeter without his chainmail investigating the progress of sappers on the castle walls missiles were occasionally shot from the castle walls but these were given little attention one defender in particular amused the king greatly—a man standing on the walls crossbow in one hand the other clutching a frying pan he had been using all day as a shield to beat off missiles he deliberately aimed at the king which the king applauded however another crossbowman then struck the king in the left shoulder near the neck he tried to pull this out in the privacy of his tent but failed a surgeon called a butcher by howden removed it carelessly mangling the kings arm in the process the wound swiftly became gangrenous richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him called alternatively pierre or peter basile john sabroz dudo and bertrand de gourdon from the town of gourdon by chroniclers the man turned out according to some sources but not all to be a boy he said richard had killed his father and two brothers and that he had killed richard in revenge he expected to be executed but as a final act of mercy richard forgave him saying live on and by my bounty behold the light of day before he ordered the boy to be freed and sent away with  shillings it is unclear whether the kings pardon was upheld following his death richard then set his affairs in order bequeathing all his territory to his brother john and his jewels to his nephew otto tomb containing the heart of king richard at rouen cathedral tomb at fontevraud richard died on  april  in the arms of his mother it was later said that as the day was closing he ended his earthly daycitation needed because of the nature of richards death he was later referred to as the lion that by the ant was slaincitation needed according to one chronicler richards last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain mercadier had the crossbowman flayed alive and hanged as soon as richard died richards heart was buried at rouen in normandy his entrails in châlus where he died and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at fontevraud abbey in anjou in  scientists analysed the remains of richards heart and found that it had been embalmed with various substances including frankincense a symbolically important substance because it had been present both at the birth and embalming of the christ henry sandford bishop of rochester – announced that he had seen a vision of richard ascending to heaven in march  along with stephen langton the former archbishop of canterbury the king having presumably spent  years in purgatory as expiation for his sins richard produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son philip of cognac as a result he was succeeded by his brother john as king of england however his french territories initially rejected john as a successor preferring his nephew arthur of brittany the son of their late brother geoffrey whose claim was by modern standards better than johns the lack of any direct heirs from richard was the first step in the dissolution of the angevin empire character and sexualityedit contemporaries considered richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess this was apparently the first such instance of this combination he was known as a valiant competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous at the same time he was considered prone to the sins of lust pride greed and above all excessive cruelty ralph of coggeshall summarising richards career deplores that the king was one of the immense cohort of sinners he was criticised by clergy chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the crusade and for his ransom whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes in the historiography of the second half of the th century much interest was shown in richards sexuality in particular whether there was cogent evidence of homosexuality the topic had not been raised by victorian or edwardian historians a fact which was itself denounced as a conspiracy of silence by john harvey  the argument primarily drew on accounts of richards behaviour as well as of his confessions and penitences and of his childless marriage richard did have at least one illegitimate child philip of cognac and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns historians remain divided on the question of richards sexuality harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians most notably john gillingham  who argues that richard was probably heterosexual flori  again argued in favour of richards homosexuality based on richards two public confessions and penitences in  and  which according to flori must have referred to the sin of sodomy flori however concedes that contemporary accounts of richard taking women by force exist concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women flori and gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bedsharing do not support the suggestion that richard had a sexual relationship with king philip ii as had been suggested by other modern authors legacyedit heraldryedit further information royal arms of england the three lions of the royal arms of england the second great seal of richard i  shows him bearing a shield depicting three lions passantguardant this is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon which later became established as the royal arms of england it is likely therefore that richard introduced this heraldic design in his earlier great seal of  he had used either one or two lions rampants combatants which arms he may have adopted from his father richard is also credited with having originated the english crest of a lion statant now statantguardant the coat of three lions continues to represent england on several coins of the pound sterling forms the basis of several emblems of english national sports teams such as the england national football team and the teams three lions anthem and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of england medieval folkloreedit main article matter of england richard marrying robin hood and maid marian on a plaque outside nottingham castle around the middle of the th century various legends developed that after richards capture his minstrel blondel travelled europe from castle to castle loudly singing a song known only to the two of them they had composed it together eventually he came to the place where richard was being held and richard heard the song and answered with the appropriate refrain thus revealing where the king was incarcerated the story was the basis of andré ernest modeste grétrys opera richard coeurdelion and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to richard thorpes film version of ivanhoe it seems unconnected to the real jean blondel de nesle an aristocratic trouvère it also does not correspond to the historical reality since the kings jailers did not hide the fact on the contrary they publicised it at some time around the th century tales of robin hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of king richard the lionheart robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of richards evil brother john while richard was away at the third crusade modern receptionedit richard coeur de lion carlo marochettis statue of richard i outside the palace of westminster london richards reputation over the years has fluctuated wildly according to historian john gillingham while contemporary sources emphasize his stern and unforgiving nature and his excessive cruelty his image is already transformed into romance depicting him as generoushearted preux chevalier a few decades after his death richard left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present in large part because of his military exploits and his popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence this is reflected in steven runcimans final verdict of richard i he was a bad son a bad husband and a bad king but a gallant and splendid soldier history of the crusades vol iii meanwhile muslim writers during the crusades period and after wrote of him never have we had to face a bolder or more subtle opponent victorian england was divided on richard many admired him as a crusader and man of god erecting an heroic statue to him outside the houses of parliament the latevictorian scholar william stubbs on the other hand thought him a bad son a bad husband a selfish ruler and a vicious man during his ten years reign he was in england for no more than six months and was totally absent for the last five years stubbs argued that he was a bad king his great exploits his military skill his splendour and extravagance his poetical tastes his adventurous spirit do not serve to cloak his entire want of sympathy or even consideration for his people he was no englishman but it does not follow that he gave to normandy anjou or aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom his ambition was that of a mere warrior he would fight for anything whatever but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for the glory that he sought was that of victory rather than conquest in world war i when british troops commanded by general edmund allenby captured jerusalem the british press printed cartoons of richard the lionheart looking down from the heavens with the caption reading at last my dream has come true general allenby protested against his campaign being presented as a latter day crusade however stating the importance of jerusalem lay in its strategic importance there was no religious impulse in this campaign depictions in modern fictionedit th century portrait of richard the lionheart by merryjoseph blondel richard is one of the most prominent monarchs in british popular culture appearing as a major or minor character in many works of fiction both written and audiovisual as noted above richard appears in connection with robin hood in sir walter scotts novel ivanhoe he is one of the main characters in scotts the talisman set during the third crusade the opera riccardo primo by george frideric handel is based on richards invasion of cyprus richard is a major character in james goldmans the lion in winter which references the alleged homosexual affair between richard and philip ii of france richard was played by sir anthony

saladin although he did not retake jerusalem from saladin richard spoke both french and occitan he was born in england where he spent his childhood before becoming king however he lived most of his adult life in the duchy of aquitaine in the southwest of france following his accession he spent very little time perhaps as little as six months in england most of his life as king was spent on crusade in captivity or actively defending his lands in france rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies nevertheless he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects he remains one of the few kings of england remembered by his epithet rather than regnal

he was a younger brother of count william ix of poitiers henry the young king and duchess matilda of saxony as the third legitimate son of king henry ii he was not expected to ascend the throne he was also an elder brother of duke geoffrey ii of brittany queen eleanor of castile queen joan of sicily and count john of mortain who succeeded him as king richard was the younger maternal halfbrother of countess marie of champagne and countess alix of blois the eldest son of henry ii and eleanor william died in  before richards birth richard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother his father was angevinnorman and greatgrandson of william the conqueror contemporary historian ralph of diceto traced his familys lineage through matilda of scotland to the anglosaxon kings of england and alfred the great and from there linked them to noah and woden according to angevin legend there was even infernal blood in the family while his father visited his lands from scotland to france richard probably spent his childhood in england his first recorded visit to the european continent was in may  when his mother took him to normandy his wet nurse was hodierna of st albans whom he gave a generous pension after he became king little is known about richards education although he was born in oxford and brought up in england up to his eighth year it is not known to what extent he used or understood english he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in limousin lenga dòc and also in french during his captivity english prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother john to help destroy the authority of richards chancellor william longchamp who was a norman one of the specific charges laid against longchamp by johns supporter hugh bishop of coventry was that he could not speak english this indicates that by the late th century a knowledge of english was expected of those in positions of authority in england richard was said to be very attractive his hair was between red and blond and he was lighteyed with a pale complexion he was apparently of above average height according to clifford brewer he was  feet  inches  m as with his supposed lack of english the question of his stature is one made from a lack of evidence as his remains have been lost since at least the french revolution and his exact height is unknown john his youngest brother by the same father and mother was known to be  feet  inches  m the itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis ricardi a latin prose narrative of the third crusade states that he was tall of elegant build the colour of his hair was between red and gold his limbs were supple and straight he had long arms suited to wielding a sword his long legs matched the rest of his body from an early age he showed significant political and military ability becoming noted for his chivalry and courage as he fought to control the rebellious nobles of his own territory his elder brother henry the young king was crowned king of england during his fathers lifetime marriage alliances were common among medieval royalty they led to political alliances and peace treaties and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each others lands in march  it was arranged that richard would marry one of the daughters of ramon berenguer iv count of barcelona however these arrangements failed and the marriage never took place henry the young king was married to margaret daughter of louis vii of france on  november  despite this alliance between the plantagenets and the capetians the dynasty on the french throne the two houses were sometimes in conflict in  the intercession of pope alexander iii was necessary to secure a truce between them henry ii had conquered brittany and taken control of gisors and the vexin which had been part of margarets dowry early in the s there had been suggestions richard should marry alys countess of the vexin alice fourth daughter of louis vii because of the rivalry between the kings of england and france louis obstructed the marriage a peace treaty was secured in january  and richards betrothal to alys was confirmed henry ii planned to divide his and eleanors territories among their three eldest surviving sons henry would become king of england and have control of anjou maine and normandy richard would inherit aquitaine and poitiers from his mother and geoffrey would become duke of brittany through marriage with constance heir presumptive of conan iv at the ceremony where richards betrothal was confirmed he paid homage to the king of france for aquitaine thus securing ties of vassalage between the two after henry ii fell seriously ill in  he put in place his plan to divide his kingdom although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories in  richard left for aquitaine with his mother and henry ii gave him the duchy of aquitaine at the request of eleanor richard and his mother embarked on a tour of aquitaine in  in an attempt to pacify the locals together they laid the foundation stone of st augustines monastery in limoges in june  richard was formally recognised as the duke of aquitaine when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office the ceremony took place in poitiers and was repeated in limoges where he wore the ring of st valerie who was the personification of aquitaine revolt against henry iiedit main article revolt of – according to ralph of coggeshall henry the young king instigated rebellion against henry ii he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him and to break away from his dependence on henry ii who controlled the purse strings there were rumors that eleanor might have encouraged her sons to revolt against their father henry the young king abandoned his father and left for the french court seeking the protection of louis vii his younger brothers richard and geoffrey soon followed him while the fiveyearold john remained in england louis gave his support to the three sons and even knighted richard tying them together through vassalage jordan fantosme a contemporary poet described the rebellion as a war without love geoffrey de rancons château de taillebourg the castle richard retreated to after henry iis forces captured  knights and  archers who fought for richard when saintes was captured the three brothers made an oath at the french court that they would not make terms with henry ii without the consent of louis vii and the french barons with the support of louis henry the young king attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money one such baron was philip count of flanders who was promised £ and several castles the brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in england robert de beaumont rd earl of leicester joined forces with hugh bigod st earl of norfolk hugh de kevelioc th earl of chester and william i of scotland for a rebellion in suffolk the alliance with louis was initially successful and by july  the rebels were besieging aumale neufmarché and verneuil and hugh de kevelioc had captured dol in brittany richard went to poitou and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father eleanor was captured so richard was left to lead his campaign against henry iis supporters in aquitaine on his own he marched to take la rochelle but was rejected by the inhabitants he withdrew to the city of saintes which he established as a base of operations in the meantime henry ii had raised a very expensive army of more than  mercenaries with which to face the rebellion he marched on verneuil and louis retreated from his forces the army proceeded to recapture dol and subdued brittany at this point henry ii made an offer of peace to his sons on the advice of louis the offer was refused henry iis forces took saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison although richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers he took refuge in château de taillebourg for the rest of the war henry the young king and the count of flanders planned to land in england to assist the rebellion led by the earl of leicester anticipating this henry ii returned to england with  soldiers and his prisoners including eleanor and his sons wives and fiancées but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed william i of scotland and hugh bigod were captured on  and  july respectively henry ii returned to france and raised the siege of rouen where louis vii had been joined by henry the young king after abandoning his plan to invade england louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in september  the treaty of montlouis when henry ii and louis vii made a truce on  september  its terms specifically excluded richard abandoned by louis and wary of facing his fathers army in battle richard went to henry iis court at poitiers on  september and begged for forgiveness weeping and falling at the feet of henry who gave richard the kiss of peace several days later richards brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father the terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict when richard was offered four castles in aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy richard was given control of two castles in poitou and half the income of aquitaine henry the young king was given two castles in normandy and geoffrey was permitted half of brittany eleanor remained henry iis prisoner until his death partly as insurance for richards good behaviour final years of henry iis reignedit a silver denier of richard struck in his capacity as the count of poitiers after the conclusion of the war the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against henry ii began the king travelled to anjou for this purpose and geoffrey dealt with brittany in january  richard was dispatched to aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him the historian john gillingham notes that the chronicle of roger of howden is the main source for richards activities in this period according to the chronicle most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in  days before the outbreak of war while others were to be razed given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles this was not an easy task roger of howden records the twomonth siege of castillonsuragen while the castle was notoriously strong richards siege engines battered the defenders into submission on this campaign richard acquired the name the lion or the lionheart due to his noble brave and fierce leadership  he is referred to as this our lion hic leo noster as early as  in the topographia hibernica of giraldus cambrensis while the byname lionheart le quor de lion is first recorded in ambroises lestoire de la guerre sainte in the context of the accon campaign of  henry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him it was suspected that henry had appropriated princess alys richards betrothed the daughter of louis vii of france by his second wife as his mistress this made a marriage between richard and alys technically impossible in the eyes of the church but henry prevaricated he regarded alyss dowry vexin in the îledefrance as valuable richard was discouraged from renouncing alys because she was the sister of king philip ii of france a close allycitation needed after his failure to overthrow his father richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of aquitaine especially in the territory of gascony the increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in  hoping to dethrone richard the rebels sought the help of his brothers henry and geoffrey the turning point came in the charente valley in the spring of  the welldefended fortress of taillebourg seemed impregnable the castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a threelayer wall richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat the garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked richard he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates where he easily took over the castle in two days richard the lionhearts victory at taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him it also won richard a reputation as a skilled military commander in – richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of angoulême his opponents turned to philip ii of france for support and the fighting spread through the limousin and périgord the excessive cruelty of richards punitive campaigns aroused even more hostility however with support from his father and from the young king richard the lionheart eventually succeeded in bringing the viscount aimar v of limoges and count elie of périgord to terms after richard had subdued his rebellious barons he again challenged his father from  to  the tension between henry and richard grew as king henry commanded richard to pay homage to henry the young king but richard refused finally in  henry the young king and geoffrey duke of brittany invaded aquitaine in an attempt to subdue richard richards barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke however richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies and they executed any prisoners the conflict paused briefly in june  when the young king died with the death of henry the young king richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the english crown king henry demanded that richard give up aquitaine which he planned to give to his youngest son john as his inheritance richard refused and conflict continued between them henry ii soon gave john permission to invade aquitaine to strengthen his position in  richard allied himself with yearold philip ii the son of eleanors exhusband louis vii by adele of champagne roger of howden wrote the king of england was struck with great astonishment and wondered what this alliance could mean and taking precautions for the future frequently sent messengers into france for the purpose of recalling his son richard who pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father made his way to chinon and in spite of the person who had the custody thereof carried off the greater part of his fathers treasures and fortified his castles in poitou with the same refusing to go to his father overall howden is chiefly concerned with the politics of the relationship between richard and king philip gillingham has addressed theories suggesting that this political relationship was also sexually intimate which he posits probably stemmed from an official record announcing that as a symbol of unity between the two countries the kings of england and france had slept overnight in the same bed gillingham has characterized this as an accepted political act nothing sexual about it a bit like a modernday photo opportunity in exchange for philips help against his father richard promised to concede to him his rights to both normandy and anjou richard paid homage to philip in november  with news arriving of the battle of hattin he took the cross at tours in the company of other french nobles in  henry ii planned to concede aquitaine to his youngest son john but richard refused the thought he felt that aquitaine was his and that john was unfit to take over the land once belonging to his beloved mother this refusal is what finally made henry ii bring queen eleanor out of prison he sent her to aquitaine and demanded that richard give up his lands to his mother who would once again rule over those lands the following year richard attempted to take the throne of england for himself by joining philips expedition against his father on  july  the forces of richard and philip defeated henrys army at ballans henry with johns consent agreed to name richard his heir apparent two days later henry ii died in chinon and richard the lionheart succeeded him as king of england duke of normandy and count of anjou roger of howden claimed that henrys corpse bled from the nose in richards presence which was assumed to be a sign that richard had caused his death king and crusaderedit coronation and antijewish violenceedit richard i being anointed during his coronation in westminster abbey from a thcentury chronicle richard i was officially invested as duke of normandy on  july  and crowned king in westminster abbey on  september  richard barred all jews and women from the investiture but some jewish leaders arrived to present gifts for the new king according to ralph of diceto richards courtiers stripped and flogged the jews then flung them out of court when a rumour spread that richard had ordered all jews to be killed the people of london attacked the jewish population many jewish homes were burned down and several jews were forcibly baptised some sought sanctuary in the tower of london and others managed to escape among those killed was jacob of orléans a respected jewish scholar roger of howden in his gesta regis ricardi claimed that the jealous and bigoted citizens started the rioting and that richard punished the perpetrators allowing a forcibly converted jew to return to his native religion baldwin of forde archbishop of canterbury reacted by remarking if the king is not gods man he had better be the devils silver penny of richard i york museums trust realising that the assaults could destabilise his realm on the eve of his departure on crusade richard ordered the execution of those responsible for the most egregious murders and persecutions including rioters who had accidentally burned down christian homes he distributed a royal writ demanding that the jews be left alone the edict was loosely enforced however and the following march further violence occurred including a massacre at york crusade plansedit richard had already taken the cross as count of poitou in  his father and philip ii had done so at gisors on  january  after receiving news of the fall of jerusalem to saladin after richard became king he and philip agreed to go on the third crusade since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross he started to raise and equip a new crusader army he spent most of his fathers treasury filled with money raised by the saladin tithe raised taxes and even agreed to free king william i of scotland from his oath of subservience to richard in exchange for  marks to raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions lands and other privileges to those interested in them those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts william longchamp bishop of ely and the kings chancellor made a show of bidding £ to remain as chancellor he was apparently outbid by a certain reginald the italian but that bid was refused richard made some final arrangements on the continent he reconfirmed his fathers appointment of william fitz ralph to the important post of seneschal of normandy in anjou stephen of tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement payn de rochefort an angevin knight was elevated to the post of seneschal of anjou in poitou the exprovost of benon peter bertin was made seneschal and finally in gascony the household official helie de la celle was picked for the seneschalship there after repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his french possessions richard finally set out on the crusade in summer  his delay was criticised by troubadours such as bertran de born he appointed as regents hugh de puiset bishop of durham and william de mandeville rd earl of essex—who soon died and was replaced by richards chancellor william longchamp richards brother john was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against william when richard was raising funds for his crusade he was said to declare i would have sold london if i could find a buyer occupation of sicilyedit richard and philip of france french manuscript of  in september  richard and philip arrived in sicily after the death of king william ii of sicily his cousin tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in  as king tancred i of sicily although the legal heir was williams aunt constance wife of the new emperor henry vi tancred had imprisoned williams widow queen joan who was richards sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in williams will when richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance she was freed on  september but without the inheritance the presence of foreign troops also caused unrest in october the people of messina revolted demanding that the foreigners leave richard attacked messina capturing it on  october  after looting and burning the city richard established his base there but this created tension between richard and philip augustus he remained there until tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on  march  the treaty was signed by richard philip and tancred its main terms were joan was to receive  ounces  kg of gold as compensation for her inheritance which tancred kept richard officially proclaimed his nephew arthur of brittany son of geoffrey as his heir and tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to arthur when he came of age giving a further  ounces  kg of gold that would be returned by richard if arthur did not marry tancreds daughter the two kings stayed on in sicily for a while but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men with philip augustus plotting with tancred against richard the two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement including the end of richards betrothal to philips sister alys who had supposedly been the mistress of richards father henry ii conquest of cyprusedit the near east in  cyprus in purple in april  richard left messina for acre but a storm dispersed his large fleet after some searching it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister joan and his new fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus along with the wrecks of several other vessels including the treasure ship survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the islands ruler isaac komnenos on  may  richards fleet arrived in the port of lemesos limassol on cyprus he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and treasure isaac refused so richard landed his troops and took limassol various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time in particular guy of lusignan all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat the local magnates abandoned isaac who considered making peace with richard joining him on the crusade and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by richard isaac changed his mind however and tried to escape richards troops led by guy de lusignan conquered the whole island by  june isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons richard named richard de camville and robert of thornham as governors he later sold the island to the master of knights templar robert de sablé and it was subsequently acquired in  by guy of lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom the rapid conquest of the island by richard is more important than it may seem the island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the holy land whose occupation by the christians could not continue without support from the sea cyprus remained a christian stronghold until the battle of lepanto  richards exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island richard left cyprus for acre on  june with his allies marriageedit before leaving cyprus on crusade richard married berengaria of navarre firstborn daughter of king sancho vi of navarre richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native navarre the wedding was held in limassol on  may  at the chapel of st george and was attended by richards sister joan whom he had brought from sicily the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour many feasts and entertainments and public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event among the other grand ceremonies was a double coronation richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus and berengaria queen of england and of cyprus too when richard married berengaria he was still officially betrothed to alys and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the kingdom of navarre as a fief as aquitaine had been for his father further eleanor championed the match as navarre bordered aquitaine thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly though they returned separately berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did and she did not see england until after his death after his release from german captivity richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct but he was not reunited with his wife the marriage remained childless in the holy landedit depiction of richard l and saladin r c – king richard landed at acre on  june  he gave his support to his poitevin vassal guy of lusignan who had brought troops to help him in cyprus guy was the widower of his fathers cousin sibylla of jerusalem and was trying to retain the kingship of jerusalem despite his wifes death during the siege of acre the previous year guys claim was challenged by conrad of montferrat second husband of sibyllas halfsister isabella conrad whose defence of tyre had saved the kingdom in  was supported by philip of france son of his first cousin louis vii of france and by another cousin duke leopold v of austria richard also allied with humphrey iv of toron isabellas first husband from whom she had been forcibly divorced in  humphrey was loyal to guy and spoke arabic fluently so richard used him as a translator and negotiator richard and his forces aided in the capture of acre despite the kings serious illness at one point while sick from scurvy richard is said to have picked off guards on the walls with a crossbow while being carried on a stretcher eventually conrad of montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with saladins forces inside acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city richard quarrelled with leopold v of austria over the deposition of isaac komnenos related to leopolds byzantine mother and his position within the crusade leopolds banner had been raised alongside the english and french standards this was interpreted as arrogance by both richard and philip as leopold was a vassal of the holy roman emperor although he was the highestranking surviving leader of the imperial forces richards men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of acre leopold left the crusade immediately philip also left soon afterwards in poor health and after further disputes with richard over the status of cyprus philip demanded half the island and the kingship of jerusalem richard suddenly found himself without allies richard had kept  muslim prisoners as hostages against saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around acre philip before leaving had entrusted his prisoners to conrad but richard forced him to hand them over to him richard feared his forces being bottled up in acre as he believed his campaign could not advance with the prisoners in train he therefore ordered all the prisoners executed he then moved south defeating saladins forces at the battle of arsuf  miles  km north of jaffa on  september  saladin attempted to harass richards army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail richard maintained his armys defensive formation however until the hospitallers broke ranks to charge the right wing of saladins forces richard then ordered a general counterattack which won the battle arsuf was an important victory the muslim army was not destroyed despite the considerable casualties it suffered but it did rout this was considered shameful by the muslims and boosted the morale of the crusaders in november  following the fall of jaffa the crusader army advanced inland towards jerusalem the army then marched to beit nuba only  miles from jerusalem muslim morale in jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly however the weather was appallingly bad cold with heavy rain and hailstorms this combined with the fear that the crusader army if it besieged jerusalem might be trapped by a relieving force led to the decision to retreat back to the coast richard attempted to negotiate with saladin but this was unsuccessful in the first half of  he and his troops refortified ascalon an election forced richard to accept conrad of montferrat as king of jerusalem and he sold cyprus to his defeated protégé guy only days later on  april  conrad was stabbed to death by hashshashin assassins before he could be crowned eight days later richards own nephew henry ii of champagne was married to the widowed isabella although she was carrying conrads child the murder has never been conclusively solved and richards contemporaries widely suspected his involvement the crusader army made another advance on jerusalem and in june  it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again this time because of dissension amongst its leaders in particular richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force saladin to relinquish jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of egypt the leader of the french contingent the duke of burgundy however was adamant that a direct attack on jerusalem should be made this split the crusader army into two factions and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective richard stated that he would accompany any attack on jerusalem but only as a simple soldier he refused to lead the army without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast there commenced a period of minor skirmishes with saladins forces punctuated by another defeat in the field for the ayyubid army at the battle of jaffa baha aldin a contemporary muslim soldier and biographer of saladin recorded a tribute to richards martial prowess at this battle i have been assured … that on that day the king of england lance in hand rode along the whole length of our army from right to left and not one of our soldiers left the ranks to attack him the sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger… both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable richard knew that both philip and his own brother john were starting to plot against him and the morale of saladins army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats however saladin insisted on the razing of ascalons fortifications which richards men had rebuilt and a few other points richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade egypt—saladins chief supplybase—but failed in the end time ran out for richard he realised that his return could be postponed no longer since both philip and john were taking advantage of his absence he and saladin finally came to a settlement on  september  the terms provided for the destruction of ascalons fortifications allowed christian pilgrims and merchants access to jerusalem and initiated a threeyear truce richard being ill with scurvy left for england on october   captivity ransom and returnedit depiction of richard being pardoned by emperor henry vi c  bad weather forced richards ship to put in

four attendants but his ship was wrecked near aquileia forcing richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central europe on his way to the territory of his brotherinlaw henry the lion richard was captured shortly before christmas  near vienna by leopold v duke of austria who accused richard of arranging the murder of his cousin conrad of montferrat moreover richard had personally offended leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of acre duke leopold kept him prisoner at dürnstein castle under the care of leopolds ministerialis hadmar of kuenring his mishap was soon known to england but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts while in prison richard wrote ja nus hons pris or ja nuls om pres no man who is imprisoned which is addressed to his halfsister marie de champagne he wrote the song in french and occitan versions to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister the detention of a crusader was contrary to public law and on these grounds pope celestine iii excommunicated duke leopold ruins of dürnstein castle where richard was kept captive on  march  richard was brought to speyer and handed over to henry vi holy roman emperor who imprisoned him in trifels castle henry vi was aggrieved by the support the plantagenets had given to the family of henry the lion and by richards recognition of tancred in sicily henry vi needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern italy and continued to hold richard for ransom in response pope celestine iii excommunicated henry vi as he had duke leopold for the continued wrongful imprisonment of richard richard famously refused to show deference to the emperor and declared to him i am born of a rank which recognises no superior but god despite his complaints the conditions of his captivity were not severe the emperor demanded that  marks  pounds of silver be delivered to him before he would release the king the same amount raised by the saladin tithe only a few years earlier and – times the annual income for the english crown under richard eleanor of aquitaine worked to raise the ransom both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes at the same time john richards brother and king philip of france offered  marks for the emperor to hold richard prisoner until michaelmas  the emperor turned down the offer the money to rescue the king was transferred to germany by the emperors ambassadors but at the kings peril had it been lost along the way richard would have been held responsible and finally on  february  richard was released philip sent a message to john look to yourself the devil is loose later years and deathedit in richards absence his brother john revolted with the aid of philip amongst philips conquests in the period of richards imprisonment was normandy richard forgave john when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew arthur richard began his reconquest of normandy the fall of the château de gisors to the french in  opened a gap in the norman defences the search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of normandy and act as a base from which richard could launch his campaign to take back the vexin from french control a naturally defensible position was identified perched high above the river seine an important transport route in the manor of andeli under the terms of the treaty of louviers december  between richard and philip ii neither king was allowed to fortify the site despite this richard intended to build the vast château gaillard richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation walter de coutances archbishop of rouen was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the dioceses most profitable and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war when philip besieged aumale in normandy richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor although the act was opposed by the church the archbishop issued an interdict against performing church services in the duchy of normandy roger of howden detailed unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of normandy the interdict was still in force when work began on the castle but pope celestine iii repealed it in april  after richard made gifts of land to the archibishop and the diocese of rouen including two manors and the prosperous port of dieppe ruins of château gaillard royal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under henry ii attributed to a concentration of resources on richards war with the king of france however the work at château gaillard was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated £ to £ between  and  this was more than double richards spending on castles in england an estimated £ unprecedented in its speed of construction the castle was mostly complete in two years when most construction on such a scale would have taken the best part of a decade according to william of newburgh in may  richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a rain of blood while some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen richard was undeterred as no mastermason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castles construction military historian allen brown has suggested that richard himself was the overall architect this is supported by the interest richard showed in the work through his frequent presence in his final years the castle became richards favourite residence and writs and charters were written at château gaillard bearing apud bellum castrum de rupe at the fair castle of the rock château gaillard was ahead of its time featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later allen brown described château gaillard as one of the finest castles in europe and military historian sir charles oman wrote that it was considered the masterpiece of its time the reputation of its builder coeur de lion as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure he was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the east but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold determined to resist philips designs on contested angevin lands such as the vexin and berry richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into war on the french king he organised an alliance against philip including baldwin ix of flanders renaud count of boulogne and his fatherinlaw king sancho vi of navarre who raided philips lands from the south most importantly he managed to secure the welf inheritance in saxony for his nephew henry the lions son otto of poitou who was elected otto iv of germany in  inverted coat of arms of richard indicating his death from a manuscript of chronica majora by matthew paris th century partly as a result of these and other intrigues richard won several victories over philip at fréteval in  just after richards return to france from captivity and moneyraising in england philip fled leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by richard at the battle of gisors sometimes called courcelles in  richard took dieu et mon droit—god and my right—as his motto still used by the british monarchy today echoing his earlier boast to the emperor henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but god in march  richard was in limousin suppressing a revolt by viscount aimar v of limoges although it was lent he devastated the viscounts land with fire and sword he besieged the puny virtually unarmed castle of châluschabrol some chroniclers claimed that this was because a local peasant had uncovered a treasure trove of roman gold which richard claimed from aimar in his position as feudal overlord in the early evening of  march  richard was walking around the castle perimeter without his chainmail investigating the progress of sappers on the castle walls missiles were occasionally shot from the castle walls but these were given little attention one defender in particular amused the king greatly—a man standing on the walls crossbow in one hand the other clutching a frying pan he had been using all day as a shield to beat off missiles he deliberately aimed at the king which the king applauded however another crossbowman then struck the king in the left shoulder near the neck he tried to pull this out in the privacy of his tent but failed a surgeon called a butcher by howden removed it carelessly mangling the kings arm in the process the wound swiftly became gangrenous richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him called alternatively pierre or peter basile john sabroz dudo and bertrand de gourdon from the town of gourdon by chroniclers the man turned out according to some sources but not all to be a boy he said richard had killed his father and two brothers and that he had killed richard in revenge he expected to be executed but as a final act of mercy richard forgave him saying live on and by my bounty behold the light of day before he ordered the boy to be freed and sent away with  shillings it is unclear whether the kings pardon was upheld following his death richard then set his affairs in order bequeathing all his territory to his brother john and his jewels to his nephew otto tomb containing the heart of king richard at rouen cathedral tomb at fontevraud richard died on  april  in the arms of his mother it was later said that as the day was closing he ended his earthly daycitation needed because of the nature of richards death he was later referred to as the lion that by the ant was slaincitation needed according to one chronicler richards last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain mercadier had the crossbowman flayed alive and hanged as soon as richard died richards heart was buried at rouen in normandy his entrails in châlus where he died and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at fontevraud abbey in anjou in  scientists analysed the remains of richards heart and found that it had been embalmed with various substances including frankincense a symbolically important substance because it had been present both at the birth and embalming of the christ henry sandford bishop of rochester – announced that he had seen a vision of richard ascending to heaven in march  along with stephen langton the former archbishop of canterbury the king having presumably spent  years in purgatory as expiation for his sins richard produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son philip of cognac as a result he was succeeded by his brother john as king of england however his french territories initially rejected john as a successor preferring his nephew arthur of brittany the son of their late brother geoffrey whose claim was by modern standards better than johns the lack of any direct heirs from richard was the first step in the dissolution of the angevin empire character and sexualityedit contemporaries considered richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess this was apparently the first such instance of this combination he was known as a valiant competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous at the same time he was considered prone to the sins of lust pride greed and above all excessive cruelty ralph of coggeshall summarising richards career deplores that the king was one of the immense cohort of sinners he was criticised by clergy chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the crusade and for his ransom whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes in the historiography of the second half of the th century much interest was shown in richards sexuality in particular whether there was cogent evidence of homosexuality the topic had not been raised by victorian or edwardian historians a fact which was itself denounced as a conspiracy of silence by john harvey  the argument primarily drew on accounts of richards behaviour as well as of his confessions and penitences and of his childless marriage richard did have at least one illegitimate child philip of cognac and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns historians remain divided on the question of richards sexuality harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians most notably john gillingham  who argues that richard was probably heterosexual flori  again argued in favour of richards homosexuality based on richards two public confessions and penitences in  and  which according to flori must have referred to the sin of sodomy flori however concedes that contemporary accounts of richard taking women by force exist concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women flori and gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bedsharing do not support the suggestion that richard had a sexual relationship with king philip ii as had been suggested by other modern authors legacyedit heraldryedit further information royal arms of england the three lions of the royal arms of england the second great seal of richard i  shows him bearing a shield depicting three lions passantguardant this is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon which later became established as the royal arms of england it is likely therefore that richard introduced this heraldic design in his earlier great seal of  he had used either one or two lions rampants combatants which arms he may have adopted from his father richard is also credited with having originated the english crest of a lion statant now statantguardant the coat of three lions continues to represent england on several coins of the pound sterling forms the basis of several emblems of english national sports teams such as the england national football team and the teams three lions anthem and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of england medieval folkloreedit main article matter of england richard marrying robin hood and maid marian on a plaque outside nottingham castle around the middle of the th century various legends developed that after richards capture his minstrel blondel travelled europe from castle to castle loudly singing a song known only to the two of them they had composed it together eventually he came to the place where richard was being held and richard heard the song and answered with the appropriate refrain thus revealing where the king was incarcerated the story was the basis of andré ernest modeste grétrys opera richard coeurdelion and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to richard thorpes film version of ivanhoe it seems unconnected to the real jean blondel de nesle an aristocratic trouvère it also does not correspond to the historical reality since the kings jailers did not hide the fact on the contrary they publicised it at some time around the th century tales of robin hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of king richard the lionheart robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of richards evil brother john while richard was away at the third crusade modern receptionedit richard coeur de lion carlo marochettis statue of richard i outside the palace of westminster london richards reputation over the years has fluctuated wildly according to historian john gillingham while contemporary sources emphasize his stern and unforgiving nature and his excessive cruelty his image is already transformed into romance depicting him as generoushearted preux chevalier a few decades after his death richard left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present in large part because of his military exploits and his popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence this is reflected in steven runcimans final verdict of richard i he was a bad son a bad husband and a bad king but a gallant and splendid soldier history of the crusades vol iii meanwhile muslim writers during the crusades period and after wrote of him never have we had to face a bolder or more subtle opponent victorian england was divided on richard many admired him as a crusader and man of god erecting an heroic statue to him outside the houses of parliament the latevictorian scholar william stubbs on the other hand thought him a bad son a bad husband a selfish ruler and a vicious man during his ten years reign he was in england for no more than six months and was totally absent for the last five years stubbs argued that he was a bad king his great exploits his military skill his splendour and extravagance his poetical tastes his adventurous spirit do not serve to cloak his entire want of sympathy or even consideration for his people he was no englishman but it does not follow that he gave to normandy anjou or aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom his ambition was that of a mere warrior he would fight for anything whatever but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for the glory that he sought was that of victory rather than conquest in world war i when british troops commanded by general edmund allenby captured jerusalem the british press printed cartoons of richard the lionheart looking down from the heavens with the caption reading at last my dream has come true general allenby protested against his campaign being presented as a latter day crusade however stating the importance of jerusalem lay in its strategic importance there was no religious impulse in this campaign depictions in modern fictionedit th century portrait of richard the lionheart by merryjoseph blondel richard is one of the most prominent monarchs in british popular culture appearing as a major or minor character in many works of fiction both written and audiovisual as noted above richard appears in connection with robin hood in sir walter scotts novel ivanhoe he is one of the main characters in scotts the talisman set during the third crusade the opera riccardo primo by george frideric handel is based on richards invasion of cyprus richard is a major character in james goldmans the lion in winter which references the alleged homosexual affair between richard and philip ii of france richard was played by sir anthony hopkins in anthony harveys the lion in winter and andrew howard in the  remake directed by andrei konchalovsky which starred patrick stewart as his father henry ii mural of sean connery as richard on display in acre israel richard appears in many other fictional accounts of the third crusade and its sequel for example graham shelbys the kings of vain intent and the devil is loose richard is a major character in norah lofts novel the lute player in martha rofhearts lionheart a novel of richard i king of england in cecelia hollands the kings witch gore vidals a search for the king and in
