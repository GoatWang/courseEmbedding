receptive to your productnext youll need to develop a sales plan before you groan another plan understand this can be a simple document for your eyes only thatll help you organize and think through your sales strategy write it in a way that makes sense for you typically it should include the followingsales goals these goals should be specific and measurable not something like selling a million

monthssales activities these are your tacticshow you plan to make the sale you may say youll sell directtoconsumer through a website or via craft shows for instance or this part of the plan may include activities like developing a sell sheet to send to independent retail storestarget accounts your sales plan should also include the accounts you want to sell to if its endusers for example

take on a new product build your marketto learn how to bring a product to market begin by selling directly to endusers thisll give you confidence that theres demand for your product and will also create referenceable customers that you can contact for product and packaging feedback before you hit the bigger leagues so where can you reach your endusersthe web is one highly effective channel and you can reach your market through your own website or via a site like ebay you can also tap into your own personal network as you begin host a home party to share your product with friends and friendsoffriends sell through local community groups and email your networkonce you get feedback directly from your customers refine the packaging and price point before approaching your next marketwholesalers youll probably start with small independently owned local stores its a good idea to start with them before hitting larger chain stores because its easier to get in touch with the direct decisionmaker and theyre more inclined to take on new unique or hardtofind items to differentiate themselves from larger stores to sell to these retailers be prepared and bring a product sell sheet photos product samples if possible and a succinct introductory letter to explain whats in it for them highlighting your products profit margin features and benefits and proven sales recordexpand

established relationships in your industrybe prepared develop a presentation and have professionallooking sell sheets ready your product should also have packaging thats ready to goknow your target understand what products they already carry and how yours will fit in dont waste your time pitching to a retailer whos unlikely to carry your producttake advantage of special programs some mass retailers such as walmart have local purchase programs that give managers authority to try local items and other retailers may have different initiatives such as minority business programsbe patient it can take up to a year or longer before you see your product on store shelves so dont get frustrated and if the final answer is no try to turn it into a learning experiencefinally remember there are
