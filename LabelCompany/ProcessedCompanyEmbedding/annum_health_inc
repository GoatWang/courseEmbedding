of behavioral health support company ableto has raised  million according to an sec filing medcity news confirmed with annum health founder michael laskoff that the company has raised a total of  million the company’s goal is to use digital health tools to help those with alcohol dependency while the methods are still yet to be disclosed laskoff indicated to medcity news that annum would look to his former company ableto which used telehealth features as a primer the company will use the recent funding to further develop and eventually roll out its program sometime in  dr mark willenbring an addiction psychiatrist who works with the alltyr clinic in st paul minnesota is annum health’s chief medical officer on his website he describes the current addiction treatment system as “not built on science but on an antiquated rehab model that has not changed much since ” to address that need in an alternative way willenbring has focused his threedecade career on bringing together aspects of illness – substance abuse mental and physical disorders – to treat chronic complex conditions laskoff told medcity that annum health is potentially looking at employers as potential customers as many
