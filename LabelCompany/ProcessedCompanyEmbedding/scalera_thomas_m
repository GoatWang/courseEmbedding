turn to slide  where denise will discuss our results denise l ramos good morning everyone i appreciate you joining us as we announce our financial results for the first quarter of  we are off to a great start in q we demonstrated our ability to extend our execution track record that reflects the strategic focus and dedication of our  global employees the impact of their commitment and contributions are clearly reflected in our ability to continue to grow across key global end markets and geographies today while we invest in our future by focusing on strategic actions that drive profitable growth and value creation so let me share some of the q financial highlights total revenue up  organic revenue up  with all  businesses contributing to the growth we delivered solid growth in global chemicals and oil and gas project pumps in key markets we also drove automotive brake pad market share gains in both europe and china and aftermarket expansion and we made market share gains across our strategic connector end markets during the quarter industrial pump projects grew  over prior year included in that growth is a number of large complex projects with longer production times and higher dollar values as a result the q revenue includes  percentage points of growth related to these large longterm industrial pump projects that are recorded over the life of the contract we are also very pleased with our adjusted segment operating margin expansion of  basis points driven by strong volume gains strong net operating productivity and restructuring savings from actions we have been taking in our interconnect solutions and koni shock absorber businesses to optimize our cost structures both businesses are producing significant growth while they redefine their longterm strategies so let me share these wellearned results interconnect solutions grew its adjusted operating margins at  basis points to  and koni expanded its adjusted operating margins by  basis points to  a big thank you to the teams for such outstanding performance keep it up these gains helped to overcome the negative effects of the mix shift to large pump projects at industrial process and the constant pricing pressure from the automotive industry as well as to help fund our strategic growth investments these solid operating results are reflected in our adjusted eps of  per share which was up  versus last year excluding special items the growth reflects a  increase in adjusted segment operating income a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense in the quarter special items are primarily related to effective indiscernible and restructuring transformation and repositioning costs this comprehensive growth directly reflects the advantages we gained from our diversified model as well as our ongoing commitment to build a stronger more focused multiindustrial company orders were up modestly in the quarter total orders were up  and organic orders were up  reflecting strength in both motion technologies and interconnect solutions partially offset by a difficult prioryear comparison in mining and delayed timing of large pump projects at industrial process so moving on to guidance as a result of our operating and strategic momentum as well as our expected lower full year effective tax rate i am pleased to announce that we are raising our full year adjusted eps guidance to a new range of  to  which raises our midpoint to  growth versus  we are maintaining our total and organic revenue guidance at  to  for  lets next turn to slide  for an update on our strategic growth drivers our strategic execution is focused on  key areas market expansion a differentiated customer experience operational excellence and effective capital deployment these  pillars are the drivers of our longterm strategy and our results this quarter are a clear indication that we are focused in the right areas in q we delivered against our key market expansion initiatives by growing an impressive  in emerging markets and  in developed markets these results were partially attributable to our ability to provide our customers with a differentiated experience so let me give you a few examples of how we win during the quarter motion technologies grew their highly profitable aftermarket brake pad business  this increase is in part due to our strong oem performance over the last several years which is now entering the dealer service cycle growth was also due to the expanded aftermarket brake pad opportunity that we announced last quarter with continental another example of this progression is at both interconnect solutions and control technologies where we have put more emphasis on working directly with customers to provide differentiated solutions rather than just being a component supplier as a result of this strategy interconnect solutions gained market share across all of their strategic end markets and control technologies just celebrated their fourth consecutive quarter of order growth in the general industrial market in q we had another significant quarter of productivity generating  million of growth savings resulting from the acceleration of our lean transformation leveraging our global strategic sourcing group and benefits from prioryear restructuring actions during the quarter we took restructuring actions totaling  million largely at interconnect solutions related to headcount reductions associated with the movement of certain production lines to an existing facility in a lowercost region this action is a continuation of our ongoing optimization of our interconnect solutions global footprint and will provide longterm benefits for the business finally we had another quarter of balanced capital deployment the organic investments we made during the quarter were focused on rebalancing and expanding our global auto brake pad production capacity expanding our oil and gas western hemisphere center of excellence facility in seneca falls and building out our aftermarket reach and capabilities these targeted investments continue to help us build on our alreadystrong foundations and will drive our longterm organic growth in addition to these organic investments we also committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of a dividend increase which we announced in late february of this year we raised our quarterly dividend  to  per share so before i pass it over to tom i would just like to appreciate our highly valued people for their dedication and commitment to itt in april i got to see firsthand the global energy and enthusiasm of our team where  of our leaders came together to advance our efforts to create a stronger healthier highperforming culture this collaborative effort with leaders from all parts of our organization and globe is a key component of taking our organization to the next level and creating added benefits for all our stakeholders it is clear our employees are truly engaged in driving our strategy and positioning itt for even longerterm success that delivers profitable growth and value creation for the future ill now turn it over to tom thomas m scalera thanks denise now lets turn to slide  for a detailed review of our first quarter results in the quarter we delivered organic revenue growth of  that reflected the power of our diversifications as each business grew in excess of  industrial process led the way with  organic growth fueled by projects in the chemical and oil and gas markets which were up  and  respectively mining grew  in the quarter mostly driven by project activity in the americas revenue growth in industrial process included  million of favorable timing for certain large longterm industrial pump projects mostly in the developed oil and gas markets this growth reflects our expanded portfolio and improved capabilities to execute against an increasing number of complex projects motion technologies delivered another strong quarter with organic growth of  motion technologies team delivered exceptional  auto growth driven by a  increase in the dealer service and independent aftermarket channels the growth in the independent aftermarket included the ramp up of our expanded contract with continental we also experienced abovemarket oem growth in europe and in china we grew  which is a direct reflection of the organic investments weve recently made in our wuxi china capabilities also contributing to motion technologies strength in the quarter was the koni shock absorber business which was up  globally this growth reflects the lasting power of the respected koni brand and the tireless efforts of the team to improve our operational effectiveness and end market focus interconnect solutions delivered its third consecutive quarter of doubledigit organic growth and their fourth consecutive quarter with  million or more in revenue the  first quarter growth at ics included gains of  in transportation and industrial  in aerospace and defense and  in oil and gas these gains were partially offset by declines in nonstrategic product lines control technologies also delivered solid organic top line growth of  as strong commercial aerospace component growth more than offset defense and endoflife program headwinds shifting to orders organic orders increased  this quarter driven by strength in global automotive friction and strategic connector end markets these gains were partially offset by a  decline in our industrial process business due to a difficult prioryear mining order compare continued softness in our base pump business and some large project order delays our organic booktobill ratio in the quarter was  with each business contributing to this result by delivering ratios at or above  q adjusted segment operating income of  million grew  due to strong volumes net productivity gains from our ongoing lean transformation and accelerated benefits from our turnaround and restructuring actions at both ics and koni these gains funded our key q strategic investments in the aftermarket expansion and our lean transformation for the quarter our adjusted eps of  per share exceeded our expectations and was  higher than the prior year the growth reflected the  increase in segment operating income the lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense the lower tax rate partially reflects mix but it also reflects the planning and execution of our tax team who has worked together to drive a basispoint reduction in our effective rate since then turning to our total revenue growth by end market on slide  growth in the quarter once again reflected the diversification benefits of the attractive end markets that we serve with our highly engineered solutions our industrial market revenue was up  driven by chemical and industrial pumps which improved  on strong petrochemical activity in north america and emerging markets mining growth of  tied to fertilizer and copper projects also contributed along with general industrial strength in connectors tied to our renewed focus on strategic end markets in the transportation market we drove  growth global automotive revenue grew  due to aftermarket expansion improved global production rates and share gains in europe and china aerospace and defense was up  due to strong commercial aerospace component demand and in addition rail was a significant contributor this quarter posting a  increase largely due to the turnaround efforts at koni and lastly energy was up  driven by a  increase in oil and gas and industrial process related to large project timing and aftermarket growth in latin america the growth in the oil and gas market is a direct reflection of recent organic and inorganic investments that we are making in our industrial process business that include our broader range of complex products our new worldclass korean facility the expansion of our engineered center of excellence in seneca falls new york and our acquisition of bornemann pumps now lets turn to revenue by geography on slide  in the quarter we delivered revenue growth of  in the us and canada due to project pump growth in the chemical oil and gas and mining end markets we also benefited from a  increase in aerospace with contributions from both our control technologies and interconnect solutions segments these strengths were partially offset by weak power shipments compared to a very strong prior year softness in our north american shortcycle base pump business and lower automotive brake pad sales due to weather dealer inventory rebalancing and the timing of platform launches total european revenue was up  or  on an organic basis reflecting  growth in automotive friction and strength in our general industrial connector business the automotive growth reflects aftermarket expansion due to strength in the original equipment service network and the ramp up of the expanded aftermarket contract with continental we also continued to outpace auto production rates and gained share in the oem market due to our ability to reliably produce highquality brake pads that consistently meet our customer specifications total emerging markets grew  in total and  organically primarily due to share gains in latin america and china these improvements were driven by  growth in industrial process and  growth at motion technologies the industrial process performance reflects a  increase in latin america in the oil and gas mining and chemical markets and the growth at motion technologies reflects automotive market share gains in china on slide  you can see that the segment operating margins expanded  basis points compared to the prior year as weve highlighted this expansion was largely the result of strong volume growth and operational execution that was driven by our ongoing lean transformation these results also reflected the effectiveness of our turnaround activities at interconnect solutions and koni these gains selffunded our organic investments and offset the negative pricing impacts from constant automotive industry pressures and the unfavorable mix impacts due to a significantly higher weighting of large pump projects and finally lets turn to slide  for our  guidance update as a result of our q performance we are tightening our full year adjusted eps guidance range and raising the midpoint our new full year adjusted eps range of  to  per share reflects an increase of  at the midpoint generating a new growth rate of  compared to  provided on this slide is a roll forward from our previously issued guidance the new adjusted eps guidance reflects first quarter operational impacts of  that were driven by higherthanexpected automotive volumes in both oem and the aftermarket and strong operating performances from our interconnect solutions and our koni shock absorber turnarounds in addition in q we did experience  of favorable timing benefits primarily due to large pump projects in our industrial process business which has no impact on our full year expectations the guidance increase also reflects a  benefit from a lower projected full year effective tax rate of  partially offset by unfavorable fx and other nonoperational items please note that our guidance does not specifically reflect any foreign exchange impacts related to potential future devaluations in venezuela as it relates to revenue we are maintaining our previous full year total and organic revenue growth ranges of  to  over the prior year the  top line growth is expected to be driven by strength in our core markets of oil and gas chemical and industrial pumps and continued share gains in global automotive it should be noted that the lower end of the revenue range contemplates some potential impacts on our industrial process business related to increasing geopolitical uncertainty in certain emerging markets while we do not provide quarterly guidance due to the lumpiness of our projects business as evidenced in q i would like to provide some color into our second quarter and second half expectations we project q revenue and growth rates to be lower than the first quarter due to the typical aftermarket seasonality in motion technologies and project timing in industrial process and from a segment margin perspective we do expect a sequential decline from the first quarter this decline is mostly due to typical seasonality in the highmargin aftermarket sales at motion technologies partially offset by slightly more favorable mix in industrial process due to a lower weighting of large pump projects and higher restructuring benefits at interconnect solutions in the second quarter we also expect a significant increase in corporate costs compared to q and the prior year this reflects incremental investments in culture and talent and higher environmental costs as a result of these factors second quarter eps is expected to be generally in line with the prior year and from the first half or second half perspective we continue to expect revenues to be secondhalf weighted and we expect second half segment margins to be approximately  basis points higher than the first half and lastly our adjusted eps guidance also assumes a secondhalf weighting in excess of  ph so now let me turn it back over to lori to start the qa session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of matt summerville of keybanc matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division i wanted to ask a couple of questions about the industrial process business first can you quantify the magnitude of push out you saw in orders and do you expect to recapture that still in  and then also maybe a little more granularity in terms of what you saw overall in ip in aftermarket and then maybe comment a little bit on the softness youre seeing in baseline pumps denise l ramos let me talk a little bit about projects and what we saw with projects we saw very strong project sales in the quarter for oil and gas petrochemical and actually mining in fact we had a  project growth in q which as we indicated negatively impacted some of our margins we do see that global oil and gas and petrochemical project orders are increasing from where they were in the second half of    but these very large projects continue to be delayed we do expect a pickup to happen in the second half of the year and the reason that we believe that is because we see that some of the longer lead time projects are being released to epcs and that the epcs are starting to order longer leadtime equipment in oil and gas and petrochemical market so thats really a good sign for the ip business and why we expect improvement as we get into the back half of the year in terms of the aftermarket service has been weak globally and thats we believe due to costcutting actions by customers and just some general uncertainty about the recovery  the economic recovery thats taking place from a parts perspective north america has been very weak for us and thats because of a slowdown in mro spending which has been impacted by the economic uncertainty and we did see some weatherrelated impacts in the first quarter we do expect that to pick up in the second half in terms of the rest of the world outside of north america weve seen good growth and thats been due to the growing installed base that we have remember capital spares are important and they can be lumpy it really depends on when plants begin to start up and so we do expect that as we get into the back half of the year that well see more improvement in our capital spares and then let me just also comment on our baseline business which is a very profitable business for us and we saw also north america softness in our baseline business for the same reasons that i articulated in the parts business international continues to grow nicely due to some market share gains that weve had with our new iso pumps there so in general we expect to see improvements in the ip orders as we go into the back part of the year we should see some of these larger projects picking up and we do expect to see some improvements in the aftermarket in these baseline pumps which will help the ip margins as we get into the back half but its something still that were waiting to see weve seen some improvement in the baseline pumps in march and april were still waiting to see some improvement on the aftermarket side matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division and then just as a followup organically by segment can you sort of talk about where the businesses should fall relative to the  to  which are going to be above maybe below or inline some sort of commentary like that thomas m scalera yes matt as we look across the year certainly we like the opportunities that we see in the industrial process business a lot of that growth is going to be project specific so we would expect ip given the demand signals were seeing in oil and gas and chemical markets in particular to give us potentially organic revenue growth at the higher end of our guidance and i think the other businesses are kind of more in line with the middle of the range as if you just kind of spread it out but the one i would really point to is in our interconnect solutions business we are not planning on significant top line growth this year we did about  million of revenue i think for a fourth quarter in a row and i think thats becoming a little bit of a new trend line for this year but whats happening matt is were growing in our strategic end markets and we are deemphasizing some noncore markets and really as a result of that were probably maintaining revenue thats pretty close to what were seeing in q carry out through the rest of the year so the story at ics as you know is around the turnaround and improving the underlying operational efficiencies that will set us up for more top line growth certainly going into  but on balance i would say ip would be at the higher end really based on project activity connectors would be at the lower end of our range and then motion tech and control technologies will be in the middle denise l ramos yes i think its important to understand with motion technologies that while weve seen some very strong growth rates at the end of last year  second half of last year and what we saw in q a lot of that was attributable to the oes the aftermarket and so as we get into the back half of this year when you think about lapping that from a year ago we dont expect to see those high volumes that we saw a year ago so we do expect that  on the motion technology side that that should moderate as we get into the back half of the year from a growth perspective operator your next question comes from the line of mike halloran of robert w baird michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division so just a followup on the interconnection growth comments so the trick here is that youre basically saying the organic growth x these endoflife contracts remains healthy but its the offsets there are you seeing a pretty consistent bleed down on those contracts as you work through the year or these step up step downs that happen at the beginning of the year how does that cadence kind of work out through the year denise l ramos its really these endoflife product lines that we identified about  year or so ago its just a gradual decline that were seeing in those endoflife projects so thats  its going to extend over this year and into next year also so youll continue to see some moderation on the top line growth for ics as tom indicated the focus that weve had on ics has been largely to deal with the cost structure because the cost structure that we had in place was too high relative to where the revenue base was and so weve been focused quite a bit on driving optimization from a facility perspective in that business which is why in the second quarter you saw us announce a further restructuring in their facilities moving from a facility in california down to a facility in mexico before that we announced a facility move out of the uk and so we continue to work on optimizing the cost structure not only with the facilities but also how we operate these facilities operationally so we hired a new individual that came in and has really been bringing in a lot of lean activities into these facilities and really leaning them out so thats been also a big part of the cost structure decline that were experiencing in interconnect solutions now for the future weve recognized that we needed to make sure that we had the team aligned around key end markets so we put gms in place for each of the key markets for ics we have a gm for oil and gas we have a gm for aerospace and defense a gm for transportation and industrial and a gm for medical thats important to us as we go out into the future because we want these teams aligned and if full pls associated with these teams we want them to go after the most profitable parts of their business and so eventually youre going to see the top line growing at ics we just dont expect to see a lot of traction around that this year with these endoflife programs and these new teams that weve gotten into place so the margin expansion that youre seeing is really related to the cost structure actions that weve had underway thomas m scalera and just one quick point on the ics defense market aerospace and defense is one of the key segments and weve had some strength to date in defense but as you know its a market these days thats very difficult to predict so thats something we also watch as it relates to the revenue and connector business as the year progresses michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division and then related on the margin side that you guys were talking about very healthy margin gains in the quarter here anything about those levels thats not sustainable versus the revenue levels youre at on a goforward basis thomas m scalera is that for connectors mike or for across the business michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division yes just for connectors thomas m scalera connectors yes i think we have great traction we  as we go through this transformation as denise is articulating the complexity will continue to increase so we are moving product lines consolidating facilities and footprint actions we built a nice foundation but i think weve done that largely by going after the lowlying fruit and using those gains to fund the additional wave of activities that we have coming through this year but we like where we are at this point in the progression the complexity does increase as we go i think once we get through this next wave of complexity and reset the footprint and put the changes in place that denise was mentioning i think that gives us a step up from where we are now but i think getting to this point was an important foundational element for the margins we just need to execute the transformation as we go through the back half of the year denise l ramos and as we indicated this year we wanted to be above  we hit it in q and we do expect to see some nice steady progressions from there based on these actions that weve taken because these are systemic changes that were making in this business so as tom said we had some lowhanging fruit but weve been going in there and we have really been reworking and rewiring the operational gearing in this business and those benefits do not go away they will sustain so were going to continue to grow this business were going to continue to see margin improvement in it but its going to be just gradual because weve got to get these changes in place operator your next question comes from the line of brian konigsberg of vertical research brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc just starting off just with industrial process so denise you mentioned that youre still seeing more delays im curious are those incremental delays i just find it curious because we have heard some of your peers talk about actually starting to book some of the early ethane crackers at least that has gotten off the ground weve seen a couple more of that hit epc in late  from my perspective it looks like things are actually getting more traction not less so im just curious is this a delay that youre seeing between epc and procurements or maybe just kind of elaborate on that denise l ramos it is true that when we look at north america and we look at the petrochemical market we did see orders pick up momentum during the first quarter in the gulf coast region and so i think thats probably what youre referring to so we did see that pick up its when you go outside of north america and you look at some of the other locations that we have in latin america and in the middle east that we were seeing on the oil and gas side some of the delays even though we had some good projects coming through it was more the mediumsized projects its the larger ones that weve seen some delays on but we have seen the improvement in the petrochemical market in the gulf coast region in north america brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc okay and maybe you can just touch on pricing so that actually is a pretty big concern as far as the early work thats coming to market how are you viewing that do you  are you more interested in i guess biding your time and waiting for pricing to firm up or do you anticipate being aggressive and trying to i dont know use productivity to try to make that a good project over time denise l ramos its very project specific i would say pricing is very competitive out there because youve got a lot of companies that are going after some of these first projects coming down the pipe were being very disciplined because we see that there are so many projects out there with the quote activity and the order activity that weve got that we can be selective and were being very careful about how we price these projects we look at it from a total cost of ownership perspective and as you go out and you get the aftermarket and you get some of that business with it also but were not chasing price and were not going to play that game but it is competitive out there and youve got a lot of people going after a lot of these projects but we believe that theres going to be enough projects out there that you dont have to give a lot on price in order for that to happen brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc if i could just ask one more just on motion tech so it seems like that continental deal you talked about last quarter actually started to kick in i was under the impression that was more of a  maybe a late  into  type of benefit is that right i mean is this kind of contributing more earlier than you thought and maybe just give us a sense of how much growth it can actually contribute over  and  denise l ramos in the aftermarket that line did kick in in the first quarter now the first quarter was large because everybody was building inventory and so well have to see how this plays out as we get throughout the year but it was really a build of inventory and what we saw is that in terms of that  the independent aftermarket that we have which is both the ate line and this new galfer line that we increased  and that was solely due to this new line that we put into place but we dont expect that kind of growth to continue into the back half of the year because it was building inventory operator your next question comes from the line of nathan jones of stifel nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division if i could just go back to ics for a minute you had talked about a  margin target for  did  in the first quarter and are talking about revenues being relatively flat for the year i would think you would incur more benefit from the restructuring as we go through the year so is there any reason why we shouldnt now expect ics margin for the year to be above  denise l ramos yes when i mentioned that  what i really was referring to is as we thought about where margins should be in  for ics probably   months ago we were targeting in excess of  so were seeing that the benefits from the restructuring that they have underway were actually receiving those benefits sooner rather than later which is why we put up a  so we do expect that we should be around the low teens or so as we go through the rest of the year but  was a good rate for us were happy with that and as i said we would just expect to just slowly increment up from there as we get into the back half of this year and as we get into  thomas m scalera yes and nathan about  of the headcount activity has taken place so far through q so we have a lot of kind of ongoing activities as were moving product lines from one location to the other theres a very systematic approach to kind of rolling that out through the year so well see the savings kind of build as the year progresses from the current actions but it really  i think we get the benefit more realized when we jump into  but we want to make sure that we continue to process those transitions very effectively as we move through the year with ics nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division as youve moved through that process in ics have you identified further opportunities to reduce cost there thomas m scalera we have  were continuing to look at opportunities as we go nathan i think we certainly have a very focused operational philosophy of how to build a truly efficient and effective global footprint so well continue to look at  to ways to optimize our operations well have some improvements in our system so that the locations that we do have interact with one another more efficiently were going to continue to focus in main locations where we have the most leverage and a truly lean operational footprint so i think the momentum is good nathan but we did close one of our smaller facilities in the uk earlier this year as well so as weve gone through the process  and we did some of that last year as well so i think there are a lot of opportunities for us just to continue to optimize with our core facilities and tying those facilities together with an efficient system design so that we can be a true global player in the connectors business nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division thats helpful and just to pick on the balance sheet for a minute weve been in a suboptimal capital structure here for quite some time now what are your focuses at the moment for the balance sheet hows the ma pipeline and what are your thoughts about getting more aggressive on share repurchase denise l ramos let me deal with the acquisition front we continue to look very aggressively at acquisition ideas as weve always said acquisitions is going to be a part of our growth out into the future so weve been investing heavily organically because we saw opportunities and weve looked at the returns on these opportunities and you can see the benefit that were getting from the organic investments that weve been making so well continue to make organic investments weve had some large ones last year and then this year with some of the facility expansions that weve had underway but as we go out into the future acquisitions will be important to us we continue to look at them we continue to have aggressive pipelines weve got some momentum going with it but as you know these things take time they need to be actionable youve got to find the right ideas that come through i believe weve got the right focus on it weve got the right people involved in it and so it will be something as we go out into the future we continue to look at balanced capital deployment so organic is important to us acquisitions are important to us we increased our dividend  in february and so that was a nice return to shareholders and then with share repurchases we purchased shares last year i think it was about  million or so we spent on share repurchases last year and this year its something that well look at at the right point in time but for right now we like the opportunity that were seeing organically and inorganically tom would you like to comment thomas m scalera no i think thats right denise i mean you look at the capex spending rates that we have this year between  and  of revenue so its a fairly significant investment in our internal capabilities and obviously wed expect that level of investment to start to step down when we exit  and get to a more normalized run rate but this is a period of continuing the focus on these organic investment ideas and whats nice about the organic investments and the ma opportunities from this point is theyre built on a solid strategic framework so as we continue to kind of evolve our businesses organically i think its giving us better clarity and focus in the ma pipeline so that we can really make sure that we have closetocore opportunities to grow our businesses when we look both  either through ma or through organic investments operator your next question comes from the line of john inch with deutsche bank john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division let me say based on where you are in your life cycle i dont think share repurchase makes a ton of sense so i agree with your strategy us and canada was up  right was that because of  are you just lumping canada in with us because canada has been a source of weakness for basically most of the industrials and particularly they site oil sands and so forth so im wondering if you could comment on ip in canada i know bornemanns got big exposure there just want more color on that region thomas m scalera yes john its  i think its unique to us in canada we have seen some pretty good growth in the upstream markets a lot of thats coming from bornemann so i think our ability to gain opportunities and share using the bornemann brand capability is also helping us grow our goulds opportunity set in canada as well its been a nice market for us but certainly not a call indiscernible on the overall economic activity in canada but i think its a reflection of bornemann share gains and bringing goulds through that opportunity set as well john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division yes  no thats right but i mean resource companies have called out canada as a source of weakness so youre actually growing in canada despite  i mean it sounds like you believe youre taking market share right would that be a fair statement thomas m scalera thats right john i think its really about share gains with the technology and then really leveraging the channel opportunities that bornemann has brought to us to really go after a new wave of opportunities so i think its very companyspecific share gains but it is largely being built off of the activity the bornemann has up in the canadian oil sands john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division spx called  talked about complicated oil and gas projects and pushouts could you maybe just help us understand a little bit what all of this actually means meaning shouldnt we have known a few years ago what the nature of these projects and their more complicated nature would actually mean this is  its not entirely clear because pumps not overtly a complicated product so maybe a little more color on what exactly is  what exactly are the bottlenecks in terms of this and what actually happens if floodgates open all of a sudden these projects get approved and you have to scramble a lot of stuff just how are you thinking about it and how are you planning for it and just help us  how does this actually pertain to your own product line denise l ramos when i think about the projects john the delays that were seeing  i believe theres really  key factors into the delays i think it does have to do with just slow economic activity and trying to figure out what thats going to look like as you got out into the future and then i think its also remembering that these projects are very expensive and theres concerns from a cost perspective about how much these companies are actually going to have to spend when they put these projects into place and i think that looking at  you can talk about the gulf coast region you can talk about some of the labor shortages that they have down there and the cost concerns associated with that i think that just puts some concerns in peoples minds that theyre being extra careful and extra prudent before they start executing these projects but the one thing that we are seeing is say why would we think that its any different now than it was  months ago is because we are seeing some of these projects now being released to the epcs and were also starting to see some of these epcs that are now ordering longer lead time equipment not pumps per se but longer lead time equipment for these facilities which we believe is going to be a good sign that the pumps are going to flow and follow from that and thats really been in the oil and gas and petrochemicals side thomas m scalera yes and i think the complexity within our portfolio certainly has increased as you know john and that means the size of the pump the capability that  of the pump the efficiency ratings the ability to move liquids that are of different viscosities so our complexity as a company has been increasing which puts us in this category where projects are largersized they stay  they take longer to build the length of our project time is extending out and thats a little bit unique to our evolution and the investments that weve made moving up the complexity ladder so it makes these conversations much more important to us because we have a bigger opportunity set here than we had in our past and were also coming up the learning curve and making more and more of these large complex pumps its an opportunity for future efficiency for us as we leverage the new korea facility and make improvements in our seneca falls operation so complexity is the name of the game i think right now with our growth the geopolitical factors that were seeing in places like russia and venezuela add to some of this uncertainty and really predicting order movements and when those orders convert into revenue so thats another factor that as we move into these kind of pumps we tend to see larger orders in those kind of areas so it does add some additional uncertainty around timing of these activities john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division well thats actually a pretty good segue into my other question wall street loves the sound bite so right now emerging markets are bad yet rockwell did a really good job in brazil and you guys are above  in emerging market so maybe you could just talk a little bit more about sort of your emerging market exposure you mentioned venezuela tom just sort of how you are able to work around macro and why you think youre getting doubledigit growth rates in regions that are obviously economically facing some pressures here denise l ramos in the emerging markets john where we put up good growth rates thats really been focused on oil and gas projects its been focused in petrochemical and its in china and the brake pad business that we have in china so we think we are gaining share in some of these attractive markets where we play how weve been focusing in oil and gas and petrochemicals is weve developed a broader portfolio which allows us to meet more of our customer demands remember we invested in korea and weve built out that korea facility i think its x or x the one that we had in place before and thats allowing us to be able to go after more of these larger complex projects in oil and gas and petrochemicals and then weve also been building out some localized sourcing weve been putting some assembly facilities in place and weve been building out our aftermarket so we think that thats how we end up gaining some of this market share that weve been going after over these past couple of years is by building out these capabilities that we have and then in china when you look at china we grew in china about  in q but now that was  a lot of that was due to our brake pad business where we built our wuxi facility and weve been building that out and so weve been getting a lot of traction associated with the automotive market in china which has been growing at very healthy growth rates and weve been taking share there and then the ip business had a nice run in china also with the chemical market and some aftermarket capture and even some oil and gas wins so china is a key part of our emerging markets along with others we expect china to be up about  or so in  for the full year and its due to the businesses that i just indicated to you operator the final question is a followup from matt summerville of keybanc matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division just a couple of quick followups what was the mix of project versus aftermarket in ip in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last and then what do you expect it to be for the full year please thomas m scalera yes in q matt we had about  or  points more project revenue this year than we had last year so a very significant tilt towards projects in q we would expect that to kind of balance out a little bit over the course of the year now that is kind of dependent on one critical factor which is we do expect the aftermarket and the baseline pump demand to improve as the year progresses so if were able to see that kind of improvement that will bring the kind of rebalancing more in line but at the end of the year we still expect pumps  large project pumps to be anywhere from  to  higher than where they were last year as a percent of our total mix matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division and then with respect to venezuela can you just run through what your exposure is there in terms of balance sheet cash thats held locally and revenue thomas m scalera yes so matt we have about  if we extrapolate a potential devaluation  so just to give the perspective on the balance sheet and our assets in venezuela  deval right now would be about a  million or about a  eps impact to us given the nature of what we do in venezuela obviously were using the applicable rate but theres a lot of uncertainty as to the rate evolution over time so at this point were using the appropriate and approved rate given the industries were in but we did a hypothetical  deval and that was about  as i mentioned so that gives you an indication of the balance sheet that comes from the fact that weve had a service and a local capability in venezuela for years so weve been operating in the environment for many many years and we do understand and appreciate this volatility what has been changing for us whats new is going back to that complexity comment with bornemann they have the ability to go after larger projects in regions like venezuela where theres a different kind of crude oil mixture and our bornemann pumps  multiphase pumps operate extremely well in those conditions we mentioned last year i think in q that we had a  million project win in venezuela so thats one thats kind of a little bit different that than our typical run rate and it has nice economic attributes to it that you would expect given the risk profile of doing business in a country like venezuela so its a project that we watch as the year progresses to make sure that all the factors are in line for us to kind of move ahead with that particular project but before we really transact additional business we want to make sure that were seeing good flows of payment and that can at times be a challenge and the payments flows out of country can actually be something that cause us to delay shipments so its something we manage but it is a little bit bigger for us now than it was based on some of these bornemann contracts that are coming through matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division and then just one last one on ics with respect to the product line repositioning into lowcost facilities what do you anticipate the permanent structural cost savings you will get in that segment from this new wave of actions thomas m scalera thats a great question matt but its hard to really put a clear line on right now because its the multiple moves that were making in rebalancing even just beyond what were doing with this set of activities i think as denise mentioned weve reached that  plateau that was kind of a critical point we have a nice  margin in q i think its really hard for us to kind of extrapolate how each individual piece will contribute this is an important move though we do have a high cost structure in north america and we have a facility in mexico that is a very efficient wellrun operation that we can continue to move production into so were going to pick up some very nice gains from that move but there are many other moves that we are taking and actions that really improve the operational effectiveness of this business so im hesitant to kind of pin it to a specific action but i think when you add it up we have a nice momentum here that were going to build throughout the course of the year and i think really one of the questions will be  maybe as we exit  where do we then recast the entitlement for ics once weve really put all these pieces in motion operator at this time there are no further questions i will now return the call to denise ramos for any additional or closing remarks denise l ramos well let me just thank everyone for joining us on the call today as youve heard this morning we are very pleased with our q performance and how we have been able to once again deliver on our commitments and move our strategy forward this is the result of focus and strong execution and well continue to create ongoing

important factors including those discussed in itts form k as well as other public sec filings lets now turn to slide  where denise will discuss our results denise l ramos good morning thank you for joining us as we announce our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of  and provide our  guidance im very pleased with the performance delivered by our nearly  itt employees all around this world in this our first full year as a standalone company in  we collectively delivered premier organic revenue growth of  for a third consecutive year we also delivered our adjusted eps commitment and we delivered a very strong adjusted free cash flow conversion of  in addition to these impressive results we also continued to execute our postspin transformation activities while we advanced our strategic growth drivers and intensified our focus on our valued customers in  we delivered against our key market expansion initiatives by growing  in north america  in emerging markets and  in a profitable aftermarket for pumps and aerospace components we also continued our laser focus on the customer which was evidenced by our investments in rd at approximately  of revenue and by our improved ontime delivery metrics at  of the  segments our progress was noted in numerous recent customer awards that recognized our technology and expanded service capabilities another  highlight for me was the commencement of the itt lean transformation initiative this commitment facilitated achieving some of the  million in gross productivity savings generated in  and were only in the initial stages of our entitywide lean transformation the companys continued focus on lean combined with the proactive restructuring initiated in  will drive further productivity benefits in  representing the real driving force behind our guidance in  we also continuously demonstrated strategic balanced and disciplined capital deployment we made organic investments of  million in  longterm growth platforms with very attractive return profiles first we started production in our stateoftheart wuxi china automotive research and development and production facility this investment drove motion technologies  growth rate in china of  so as a result china now represents  of motions total revenue an improvement of  percentage points from last year and we now have a strong foundation in china that we will leverage for even further growth second we invested in a new korean oil and gas production facility with advanced lean capabilities which will come online in the second half of  this facility will play a central role in advancing our energy strategy by becoming our eastern hemisphere energy center of excellence we also executed  significant fourth quarter portfolio actions representing a net deployment of  million in late november we completed the bornemann pumps acquisition which will play a key role in advancing our global energy strategy by adding bornemanns leadership in differentiated oil and gas pumping technologies to our existing portfolio of highly engineered solutions i want to once again welcome the bornemann team to itt and let you all know how energized we are by the magnitude of our combined future growth potential and in december we divested nonstrategic shapecutting product lines at control technologies this divestiture refocused our key endmarket strategies and generated a nice gain of  million and finally we returned  million to our valued shareholders through meaningful share repurchases and our solid annual dividends and im pleased to announce today that we will continue to return cash to shareholders in  through an additional  million of share repurchases and a  increase in our quarterly dividend to an even  per share so in summary im very pleased that in our first full year we were able to deliver on our commitment to all itt stakeholders our people advanced our strategic agenda delivered our financial commitments and enabled the deployment of capital in a meaningful balanced and valuecreating way so now lets turn to slide  and lets discuss our  adjusted eps performance so let me start by pointing out that our  adjusted eps nicely exceeded our expectations due to very strong operational performance of  and strong cost controls i also want to point out that our november guidance still included the earnings from our discontinued shapecutting business and it did not reflect the impact from the bornemann operations so keep in mind that both of these transactions took place later in the fourth quarter in total these portfolio actions represented a  to  impact compared to our november guidance after giving effect to these actions our adjusted eps grew  to  but when i step back and i look at our underlying operational performance excluding the spin dissynergy costs of  our adjusted eps was up an impressive  now thankfully this is the last time we need to discuss spin dissynergies but i do think that in this postspin transformational period it is important to assess the underlying financial performance so in conclusion we delivered on our adjusted eps commitment through solid productivity and we did that while absorbing the impacts of our strategic portfolio actions lets turn to slide  and discuss the fourth quarter results in the fourth quarter revenue was up  on an organic basis this was driven by strong growth in chemical and oil and gas pumps as well as market share gains in automotive and strong emerging market growth these strengths more than offset the weakness and market share losses in connectors which was down  organically organic orders were flat in the fourth quarter strong aerospace component order growth of  and solid automotive growth of  driven by share gains in north america and china were offset by industrial pump project order delays and continued weakness in european connectors adjusted segment operating income was up  to  million driven by solid net operating productivity which added  million of incremental benefit before the impact of bornemann segment operating income actually increased  despite the negative impacts from connectors spin dissynergies and the  million negative impact of foreign exchange fourth quarter adjusted eps of  wouldve been  before the  bornemann impact we also saw a higher effective tax rate of  in q due to the stronger mix of highly taxed us income which negatively impacted eps by  relative to our expectations so im very pleased with the magnitude of our fourth quarter operational strength which nicely exceeded our expectations entering the quarter the temporary bornemann impacts were primarily due to some operational disruptions caused by the december timing of the transaction while we are pleased with how we performed throughout  we recognize that some of the headwinds we saw in the fourth quarter are continuing into  and we are specifically watching the order delays in industrial process and the persistent weakness in europe so now lets turn our attention to  on slide  where i will share with you our strategic framework for  we are providing a balanced revenue outlook in the current economic conditions that reflects solid organic revenue growth of  and total revenue growth of  we also expect adjusted eps at the guidance midpoint to be up  due to our intense focus on productivity and other internal actions and we expect  basis points of margin expansion driven by the impact of the prior year restructuring actions and productivity that more than offset the dilution from the acquisition in  we will once again be focused on driving value creation by leveraging our strategic growth drivers we expect strong performance in north america with growth of  to  and we expect emerging markets to grow approximately  we will continue to focus on the customer with strong investments in technology and innovation accelerated ontime delivery and improved customer responsiveness  were targeting  million of gross productivity savings furthering our lean transformation initiative and we will take additional restructuring actions totaling  million to  million largely at interconnect solutions as we progress the connectors turnaround led by new  our new segment president neil yeargin finally we expect another year of strategic balanced and effective capital deployment we expect to make significant investments in the strategic areas of oil and gas aerospace and aftermarket capture these targeted investments will drive our growth into the future we will also continue to advance our portfolio growth strategy through the successful integration of bornemann and the building of our ma pipeline that reflects nearterm opportunities in the  million to  million revenue range and as i mentioned we are going to continue to return capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases of up to  million and increasing our already strong dividend by  to  per share quarterly so now ill turn it over to tom to discuss our  guidance in greater detail thomas m scalera thank you denise now lets turn to slide  to discuss our annual  guidance we expect total revenue growth of  to  that will be driven by the bornemann acquisition and  to  percentage points of organic growth the  growth will be driven by strength in core markets of oil and gas chemical and general industrial and share gains in global automotive that will more than offset declines in mining and defense also contributing to our revenue growth in  will be another strong year of expansion in emerging markets where our  growth will be driven by oil and gas chemical and automotive gains sequentially second half revenue will be slightly higher than first half revenue due to the timing of large project shipments out of bornemann and assumed improvements in key markets as a result on a yearoveryear basis first half total revenue is expected to be up in the midsingle digits while the second half is projected to be up in the low double digits once again we expect strong net operating productivity to fuel a basispoint expansion in adjusted segment operating margin to  this expansion is over and above the targeted investments we planned for the year we also expect quarterly margins to improve as we realize the benefits of restructuring actions and improved volumes our  adjusted eps range of  to  per share represents  growth at the midpoint and a growth range of  to  as denise mentioned this guidance is deeply rooted in operational improvements and productivity gains it should also be noted that our  guidance reflects a  eps headwind caused by the recently announced currency devaluation in venezuela as is our practice we do not provide quarterly guidance due to the lumpiness and longcycle nature of our industrial process segment but we are currently expecting around  to  of our adjusted eps to be in the second half of  as a result most of our yearoveryear growth will be delivered in the second half the  biggest internal drivers of this performance are the timing of restructuring benefits and the timing of bornemann backlog shipments next id like to point out that our  free cash flow conversion rate will be less than  due to significant organic investments in industrial processs global capabilities and expansion in china automotive we are forecasting  capital expenditures in excess of  of revenue however keep in mind that the largest capital projects will be heavily subsidized through local incentives that will be recovered over time through lower cash taxes before we turn to the next slide id like to point out that weve provided our current projections of the major  special items asbestos and restructuring items are expected to be fairly consistent with  level we are projecting higher repositioning costs in  as we will complete all of the remaining required transition service agreements with exelis and xylem and lastly we anticipate  million to  million of first year nonoperating costs at bornemann related to integration and inventory stepup amortization so now lets turn to the revenue outlook by end market on slide  our  total revenue growth expectation reflects strong contributions from the bornemann acquisition and solid organic revenue growth in these difficult macroeconomic conditions energy our fastestgrowing end market is being propelled by the percentagepoint growth contribution from bornemann energy growth excluding bornemann would be in the mid to high single digits reflecting first half order delays in large projects bornemann entered the year with nearly  of its revenues in backlog giving us confidence in our total growth expectations the chemical and industrial pump market is also expected to generate growth of  in  due to global chemical market demand strength and some additional contributions from bornemann in our largest markets of automotive rail and transportation we expect low singledigit growth due to automotive market share gains in north america and china that will be partially offset by lower european automotive production rates the mining market is facing the largest headwinds in  and is now expected to be down nearly  due to lower industrywide capex projections and project timing following a very strong year of  growth in  we also expect to face headwinds in highmargin defense markets due to mounting us budget pressures and uncertainty around sequestration lastly in general industrial markets we expect steady growth during the year at around  to  this growth will be driven by our control technologies industrial businesses and some recovery at interconnect solutions on slide  we provided our  revenue outlook by geography we expect to deliver total revenue growth in north america in the  to  range this includes solid revenue growth in oil and gas and chemical pumps expanding automotive market share and general industrial growth these gains are expected to be offset by weak defense conditions and the impact of an endoflife aerospace program we expect western europe to be up  to  reflecting the bornemann acquisition please note that bornemanns western european oil and gas projections include sales that are ultimately destined for global customers outside of europe and we currently estimate that  to  of those sales are exported primarily to emerging markets including venezuela excluding the benefits from bornemann we expect to be flat to down  in western europe this reflects weakness in european connectors and pressures from declining production levels in western european automotive however our strong automotive aftermarket and recent oem share gains are expected to mitigate most of these pressures finally emerging markets are expected to grow  reflecting oil and gas expansion driven by bornemann significant automotive share gains in china and general industrial strength these gains will be partially offset by recent weakness in large mining project activity in latin america excluding bornemann and the impacts of foreign exchange emerging markets are expected to expand  following our  growth in  on slide  we will review our adjusted segment operating margin guidance in  were expecting segment operating margins to expand  basis points to  this growth will be fueled by  basis points of operational improvement primarily from productivity in addition we are expecting  basis points of incremental benefit from the  and  restructuring actions prior to the impact of bornemann adjusted segment operating margins are expected to expand  basis points we will use these operational strengths to offset inflation and to fund our  basis points impact from our organic growth investments now lets wrap up on slide  where weve summarized our  annual guidance in the form of an adjusted eps walk we expect  adjusted eps to grow  at the midpoint of our  to  per share range please note that this range reflects the  per share impact from the recently announced currency devaluation in venezuela as a result of some of the top line uncertainty caused by the current macroeconomic conditions our  adjusted eps midpoint growth will be driven by strong productivity gains and operational improvements that we can control in  we will deliver gross productivity of  million or  per share by leveraging the itt management system to drive incremental lean six sigma and global sourcing initiatives this productivity also reflects over  million in incremental restructuring savings from the  and  actions that were primarily centered on improving our european operational effectiveness as we have effectively done in the past we will once again reinvest a healthy portion of this years productivity back into our longterm strategic growth initiative this years  of investments will be focused in  areas with very attractive and profitable longterm dynamics global oil and gas the itt lean transformation aerospace and global aftermarket capture unallocated corporate expenses are expected to be generally in line with  levels however certain nonoperating expenses are expected to increase compared to  due to higher prior year insurance recoveries our structural effective tax rate is projected to be consistent with  levels at  and we expect the average  diluted share count to be between  million and  million shares reflecting the benefits of todays announced buyback which will help to offset increased option exercises and dilution attributable to the recent share price gains finally id like to point out that in  we expect midsingledigit accretion from the bornemann acquisition excluding integration and stepup amortization impacts so in summary we believe our  guidance is reflective of the current environment we face and is balanced for the potential headwinds and tailwinds we will focus our efforts on delivering the productivity within our control executing the bornemann integration and generating strong returns on our organic investments now let me turn it back to christy to start the qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is coming from brian konigsberg of vertical research brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc so just first starting on the industrial process and project delays if youd give us a little more color on where youre seeing the delays your confidence that its just simply a delay not a cancellation and if you can if you would characterize it by oe versus aftermarket we were hearing from some of your peers that aftermarket actually took a pause in q did you see similar trends denise l ramos yes this is denise in terms of ip where were seeing most of the project delays are in the oil and gas end market and what were seeing and what gives us some confidence in the back half of the year is when you look at some of the activity thats been taking place the feed activity the quote activity that remains high so actually were seeing some acceleration with those quotes and whats happening from that perspective and so we think and we believe that that is going to benefit us as we get into the back half of the year but we need to see some of those projects coming through in around this first quarter in order for us to benefit with some of that into the back half of the year the other thing remember in terms of the back half of the year the backlog that we have in ip today is  because theyre long leadtime projects they do  many of those projects are backend loaded and we know that theyre going to be delivered in the back half in terms of aftermarket were actually seeing that aftermarket is holding up very nicely for us so were not seeing many challenges with that currently we did see a slowdown in the fourth quarter and we saw that continue a little bit into january but what weve seen  been seeing is weve been seeing some increasing positive signs coming from the aftermarket as weve transitioned into the first quarter thomas m scalera and brian just to follow up on the mining side thats one of the markets where we are continuing to see more pervasive delays playing through and thats why weve indicated the down  in the mining market those projects are in a little bit more of a pronounced delay cycle at this point but again we havent seen cancellations some of those projects are just slow to come online from an oe perspective brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc got you and if i could just move over to interconnect so the margin in the quarter was actually fairly strong its a nice improvement from q maybe just give us some color how much of that is from restructuring actions youve taken already versus i dont know improvement operationally within the group itself without the benefits of restructuring and how do we think about the run rate going into  denise l ramos let me just give an overview first for connectors and ill have tom respond specific to the question whats happening in connectors right now is we are refocusing that business on some of the key growth markets in the harsh environment sector of these markets so weve been doing a lot of work from a very holistic perspective around front end and better coordination on the front end around engineering marketing and sales weve also been driving the operation and weve been driving more productivity were doing more kaizens in the facilities and were driving considerable operational improvements and productivity into that business and we took some restructuring in that business thats going to help change that cost structure so that we get a more efficient and effective cost structure thomas m scalera yes and brian at this point there were benefits in q from the restructuring actions we had initiated earlier in  so were starting to gain momentum there about  maybe  million to  million of restructuring benefits already falling into q and the way to think about this weve announced some other actions those are coming online early in the first half of  so the run rate that we exited  will certainly accelerate  will generate incremental savings in  from new actions so on an allin basis for the full year  we probably generated anywhere from  million to  million of benefit on restructuring activities at ics in  and we would expect a number about twice that size based on the actions were taking in  operator your next question comes from mike halloran of robert w baird michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division so on the industrial process side i think the slide deck had the bornemann pumps acquisition about basispoint headwind in the quarter on the margins there could you talk a little bit about how much of that is kind of operational how much of that is more onetime items associated with the transaction itself and then also when you think about  could you talk a little bit about how you expect those  million to  million of costs to layer in through the year and ill leave it there thomas m scalera yes sure mike so that basispoint impact to ip margins in the fourth quarter was attributable to operational disruption in the fourth quarter so theres about a  hit that we saw in the bornemann results and i think that was really attributable to doing an acquisition late in the year so we didnt have very much time including the december holidays to really go through the required kind of shutdowns inventory accounting and other activities so there was a little bit of disruption in the december results that really caused the drag youre seeing in the margins again it was about  impact what weve then excluded for  and what well exclude for  are the integration costs and the inventory amortization stepup there was some of those costs that took place in  that were not part of this margin analysis because they were in the special items category given the size and the nonrecurring nature so as you look into  its  the  million to  million that were talking about is probably  million to  million of inventory stepup amortization and the rest is integration activities and i would say given the longcycle nature of this business its going to take us all  quarters to run that  million to  million through the pl and itll be done ratably throughout the year denise l ramos so weve owned bornemann now for about  months and let me tell you this is an exciting business their fundamental business is outstanding were very optimistic in fact we even like it more now than we did really before we owned them their product development pipeline is very exciting were really getting into that and getting the team together to align around that they have a food and pharma business which is very exciting to us where we see that we can provide some infrastructure report in north america to help it grow we also  the synergies that weve identified were excited about those synergies tend to be in the aftermarket which is one of our key growth areas in ip anyway where were going to leverage service centers and were going to look at pricing strategies were going to be able to leverage our north america distribution channel and leverage some of the strategic agreements that we have there and weve had really positive reaction from our customers so its all been extremely positive for us with bornemann i have visited there twice the team is excited were excited about having them as part of itt going forward when you look at what weve seen in the first quarter so far in the first  months theyve had very solid orders and backlog in fact ahead of our expectations so we continue to remain very very excited and optimistic about this acquisition michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division no i agree it makes sense last one there the  million to  million tom you guys are including or excluding that from the adjusted number thomas m scalera that is an adjustment so it would be a special item it would be excluded from our guidance michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division got it thomas m scalera we put a table in the press release  im sorry in our slides that highlights the items that are excluded deemed special items so theres actually on one of our  what page its on page  you could see the table there with the items that are excluded michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division yes sounds good and then on the european automotive side of things maybe just talk a little bit about what the production schedules look like what the customers are saying at this point of how they expect their business to ramp or not ramp i suppose through the year at this point thomas m scalera yes mike the conditions in european automotive are obviously challenging and were now seeing that across all the different countries in germany so  im sorry in europe and including germany at this point so its been evolving throughout the region to the point where all of the producers are facing more pronounced headwinds so the way we look at the market going in we expect it to be a down market its similar to what we saw in  despite these production challenges across europe which could be anywhere  for the full year anywhere from  to  down from a total production basis including eastern europe well expect to outperform that based on the market share gains that we generated in  and the platform content we see in europe across our different customer base we also have a strong aftermarket component within europe and that may make us unique relative to some of the other peers while there are some pressures in the aftermarket it is a generally stabilizing factor when we look across our revenue for the year and we have pretty good line of sight at this point through the first quarter production and i think thats giving us some comfort as we look through the first half of the year the uncertainty remains around the second half production levels so our year is fairly balanced but we do have a frontend weighting towards more aftermarket where were seeing some better visibility and we think well be watching more closely the second half production levels across the european producer customer base denise l ramos the business model that we have there and the operating model that we have there is proving to be very effective in this type of a situation that we have in europe right now because while europe is having some of its challenges in the automotive market because of the type of operation that we run where were able to solve problems quickly where weve got very good quality in the brake pads were able to continue to gain share in europe to help compensate for that and then with our brake pad business what were doing is taking whats been historically a european business and were expanding that into north america and china and so were expecting to see very strong growth rates in  with about a  growth rate in north america and about  growth rate in china so those platforms continue to do well for us as we become more of a global automotive company and transition away from just a european one michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division makes sense auto aftermarket is still about  in europe give or take thomas m scalera the auto aftermarket is probably a little closer to  mike michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division  okay thomas m scalera and as weve been winning share content its probably drifting a little bit north on the oe side of  so maybe  at this moment based on the recent share gains weve had michael halloran  robert w baird  co incorporated research division just last one for me then you saw a spike in the margins on the control tech side maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how much of that is just the reconfigured portfolio how much is mixed how much is mix from here and then whats the appropriate level to think about when you look at  and beyond thomas m scalera yes its a great question mike we did pick up maybe  basis points of margin based on the divestiture of a nonstrategic product line so that gives us a little bit of margin tailwind but obviously you look at those margins for q north of  we have a very strong operating culture at control technologies so were refocusing the front end of that business the product line divestiture is an example of that that were going to continue to drive a very strong productivityoriented organization to end markets where we have greater competitive advantages and the ability to really drive value for our customers and that has been translating to positive mix positive price positive volume so at this point well continue to refine that portfolio and really channel those strengths to drive these kinds of margins well have a little bit of a margin headwind next year when the defense and one of the aerospace programs that they have face some pressures but the underlying strength of this business is something were going to continue to leverage and grow on from where we are at this point operator your next question comes from matt summerville of keybanc matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division couple of questions youve talked about the anticipated growth rates youre looking for in north america and china in motion tech can you talk about specifically if that growth is predominantly being driven by the historical relationship youve talked about with ford or whether or not you are seeing progress in sort of breaking into some of the other  large remaining north american oes thomas m scalera yes great question matt so at this point north america for us is still a ford conversation having said that we continue to work on expanding platforms with ford and well obviously benefit from new introductions and new models that they have but what were talking about for  at this point is exclusively ford but i could tell you that we have a number of ongoing conversations gm is a global customer of ours that we deal with quite a bit in europe and also in china so well continue to have ongoing dialogue with all of the producers quite frankly anywhere in the world including the primary us manufacturers and in china our customer base is really nicely diversified across our existing global relationships we have and the jvs that theyre a part of and even some of the local producers we look at from timetotime so we have a very good pipeline of opportunities in china and the fact that weve been up and running  and youve seen in q that our margins at motion tech were impacted by some investments at a much higher rate that youve seen historically those investments are really about starting up that facility in wuxi china which is a very well run heavily automated facility that mirrors the strengths that we have in europe so we really replicated the european production strengths and moved those into china the fact that were there and that were up and running is drawing a lot of attention in the marketplace and is giving us a very significant pipeline of opportunities in the china market as well denise l ramos the fact that we have relationships with gm and some of these other more global companies outside of north america is benefiting us especially as they start going more to global platforms and as they start looking at consolidating their supplier base so i would expect to see that well continue to be able to penetrate into gm chrysler and some of these others because weve built relationships with them not in north america but elsewhere and i think that will eventually translate into north america matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division as we think about what youre trying to do from a lean standpoint and these round numbers  million of productivity in  looking for  million of productivity in  how much of that are you seeing get inflated away how much would you anticipate reinvesting into growth near term but also just more on a longerterm run rate standpoint i guess denise or tom what can we expect to trickle down to the bottom line as you get further along with this productivity push denise l ramos the lean transformation just from a highlevel perspective is something thats getting a lot of focus here internally at itt and we see  weve laid out a roadmap over the next  to  years of what were going to be able to accomplish so this is something that has gotten a lot of momentum that everybody is getting aligned around because we do believe that this is a way thats going to help drive value in this company and so weve got a roadmap laid out for the next  to  years that lays out how we achieve the goals that weve established so with that tom then ill turn it over to you thomas m scalera yes matt we typically target about  gross productivity using the mix of lean activities which are obviously accelerating our focus on a goforward basis as denise mentioned global sourcing and then restructuring so this year in  we will see a heavier weighting towards restructuring benefits driving our gross productivity so thats around  we net that against the inflationary pressures that we see that range typically  to  inflation that we want to stay ahead of and we really want to drive productivity and not be reliant on price so price for us is something that we strive for and we have a lot of initiatives where we go out and target but its not an area that we want to rely on because there are market dynamics that sometimes are hard to control so we drive productivity to offset inflation and then we look at the balance of what drops through and use that to fund our strategic investments maybe anywhere  basis points that would go into strategic investments based on the opportunities that we see this year we have a nice set of opportunities were talking about  of investment but they are in some cases refueling the lean transformation because we are putting some of that investment dollar back into relaying out some of our largest facilities and really improving our lean flow and were also looking at some very strong growth markets for us so thats the way we think about it at a very high level matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division and then i just  i want to spend a minute talking about industrial process first can you talk about what the mix of business you saw in the core company for  project versus aftermarket and based on how youve rolled up the year for  how you expect that to evolve thomas m scalera sure yes were definitely seeing a change in dynamic there matt theres no doubt about it so weve been growing our portfolio in oil and gas and mining and our capabilities are much more global than theyve been and weve been talking about this change in the weighting so if i look at really large project mix in  it was in the  of our total revenue range by  that number had grown to  so you look of that strong  organic growth that we drove in industrial process this year that was heavily weighted towards new projects that that increased the weighting for  especially when you put bornemann in that number is going to move all the way up maybe closer to  to  for  so the key then is to really  and denise mentioned it the aftermarket cycle for all of these oe platforms is going to start to kick in in a much more significant way from a growth perspective so it will take us time to kind of rebalance this percent mix that we see but  to  years down the road this aftermarket cycle should really start to torque up and thatll give us an even nicer margin profile going forward matt j summerville  keybanc capital markets inc research division and then just one last one for me on bornemann i think tom in your prepared remarks you specifically called out bornemann being much stronger in the second half of  versus the first half based on kind of their project shipment schedule can you quantify that is it  is it  can you help put some numbers around that so were able to model this correctly thomas m scalera yes its closer to  matt and the back half being  first half being  and thats been the typical seasonality that we typically notice in bornemann and thats what we see in the current order book at this point operator your next question comes from jim krapfel of keybanc  im sorry morningstar james krapfel  morningstar inc research division yes this is jim morningstar can you explain efforts to expand your aftermarket capabilities and overall capture rate and then what growth rate have you been seeing overall across the business and aftermarket thomas m scalera yes sure jim the aftermarket capture strategies are fairly comprehensive so weve looked at new systems and data to help us track aftermarket opportunities were putting new footprint online in key regions where weve been recently selling large projects and we need to have a local presence to be able to provide the service capabilities were also putting new leadership in place that were very excited about in our industrial process aftermarket to help us drive new strategies on a global basis in that business and even as you go across the platform there are some very interesting activities we have in both motion technologies and in our aerospace business to basically drive additional parts into the aftermarket cycle and next year we would expect on this base aftermarket growth in the  to  range given where we are in  as i mentioned before were starting to kind of build into that upward trajectory based on the projects weve been seeding globally over the last  to  years james krapfel  morningstar inc research division okay great and then second question i know you have spoken about interconnect solutions being all things to all people and focusing more on the harsh environment so for the  of the business thats specialized applications would you expect  how much of that would you expect to kind of go away over time and focusing more on the harsh environment thomas m scalera yes were in that process now jim so it  with  its about  to  harsh environment today so the remaining product lines were going through  we always do product line eva analysis but certainly when a business is facing the pressure that youre seeing in ics weve spent a lot more time really focusing through each product line and building a specific strategy for each one and it varies across the portfolio based on the age of the product and what we see for the future but the reality is were going to keep focusing on our key growth end markets like aerospace and oil and gas in particular medical and a few rail a few of these harsh environment spaces where we are very strong we think we have nice growth trajectory from this point and well be very prescriptive in how we kind of manage the other product lines including in some cases exiting small lines if that makes more sense to refocus us on the primary areas operator your next question comes from john inch of deutsche bank you have a followup from brian konigsberg brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc just following up on industrial process and really kind of honing in on your strategic alliances so you guys have aligned yourself with chevron with shell you announced something fairly recently i think you have an alliance with conocophillips as well just kind of thinking about the upcoming build of petrochemical projects in the united states kind of really north america how did those strategic alliances actually position you does that give you exclusive rights to sell pumps and valves into the projects that theyre building or is it really going to be  remain a competitive scenario when those get off the ground denise l ramos no it remains a competitive scenario but what happens is you become what ill call a preferred supplier so what typically happens is there would be maybe  suppliers that would have these strategic agreements and really what youve done is theyve said that you meet their criteria that they have for a person that they want to do business with and so while it doesnt eliminate the competition that exists there it does make  it does narrow it and so that youre in competition with just a couple of people within that bidding process and then what they end up doing is because they dont want to align totally with just one supplier they will tend to spread out the process over a number of different suppliers and so they dont just rely on one supplier brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc and just on aftermarket there as well how would you say  or how would you characterize the biggest competition is it more the customer base thats repairing or working on their own equipment or is it really  are you competing against your peers there thomas m scalera yes brian i would say it kind of  it varies so there are certain pumps and projects based on size and complexity where we could see our customer servicing that equipment and youll see that kind of activity that may be part of the delays that we experienced in q in the cycle as you start to move up the complexity scale certainly we think if were the oe producer we have the best opportunity to capture that aftermarket given the technical specifications and tolerances which is really where our focus is there are some areas in between where we do see other players that well try to disintermediate and try to grab some parts here and there and occasionally the larger players will also look across the spectrum of opportunities but the key for us is to remain very competitive in how we see these large complex global projects and then follow that up with a good global aftermarket capture streams so that we can be close to those customers and we think that combination gives us a high capture rate success brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc do you have any idea how penetrated you are today and where that could go thomas m scalera in north america were very heavily penetrated from an aftermarket capture strategy the key for us is the global growth that weve had in oil and gas and mining and now even in chemical its really picking up on a global basis is that we need to continue to put more resources in play outside of north america and thatll help us capture a higher percent of the activity we do have a new aftermarket leader in industrial process thats helping us really map out where we think we see the best opportunities to make those aftermarket investments but we do have good capabilities around global parts in the aftermarket we do have strong service but theres certainly opportunity for us to make growth investments outside of north america denise l ramos we see this as a very nice growth opportunity for us and we recognize that when you look at where we are today in the margins that we have in ip being impacted by the fact that we have a lot of these large projects that are there over time that is going to change as we get more aftermarket business and as tom indicated we just hired a new aftermarket leader in industrial process that were very excited about thats going to be looking at our aftermarket strategy globally and so our focus is to be able to drive that to create incremental value for us brian konigsberg  vertical research partners llc great and just one last question just on seals so thats obviously a very important component of the pump and i guess the biggest source of aftermarket service is that something youd be strategically interested in bringing inhouse or does it make more sense to source it externally denise l ramos we  its  we look at a lot of different opportunities when we think about the pipeline for ip we have to think about whether or not that is a core competency that we really think that we have internally to be able to do that and couple it with the pumps that we have so id say its an ongoing discussion point that we have internally and  but weve made really no conclusion on that operator your next question comes from john inch of deutsche bank john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division sorry about the technology issues so and i apologize i got on the call late but does your  guide denise and tom include aftermarket benefit from all of these sort of class  class  pumps that youve been installing over the years do you think that that aftermarket from a  the install kicks in this year or is it more of an event for next year denise l ramos i dont think its a significant impact in  for us id say its been a gradual incline around those  around that aftermarket but i wouldnt hold that out as something thats significantly changing and impacting our trajectory for  we will see that continue to build as we go out into  and  thomas m scalera and certainly as bornemanns mix right now is more heavily weighted towards oe so youll  well continue to add  they have about  of their revenue in the aftermarket so this gradual build i think is from our recent project activity and thats going to start to pick up if you go back  or  years ago those projects are starting to kind of begin to ramp through in  what we want to do as denise mentioned is build up the aftermarkets we can capture the greater content on bornemann their aftermarket as were building up our own aftermarket base but i do think its a gradual slope in  and start to pick up more noticeably in  john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division but you are seeing some of this already are you not thomas m scalera yes yes denise l ramos we are we are john thomas m scalera yes were seeing  the first cycle thats churning through were seeing capital spares start to come through at this point from projects we sold  to  years ago john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division right okay no that make sense on bornemann my understanding was that they licensed away their aftermarket and that itt on a relatively short period basis would be able to sort of realign contracts and begin to do that stuff yourself is that  and i apologize if you went over this but is that a significant part of your  guide or does that kick in more proportionately as you unwind some of those thirdparty agreements and do more of the stuff yourself is that more proportionately an impact for  denise l ramos its going to impact in  because weve got some things to work through there and remember this is a longcycle business so what youve got in the pipeline today and in the backlog today youre really not going to be able to impact much until you get out into  based on the initiatives that you put in place today thomas m scalera but i could tell you john were actively working all the issues right now its one of our top priorities its just the contract timing and the market timing issues that we just have to work through this year john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division if i can switch gears to automotive in europe where was your auto business in europe in  like it  was it roughly flat because the builds were down about  where im going with this denise l ramos yes it was flat to plus one john and thats europe in total that would be western and eastern europe john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division right so builds are going to be down i realize its still difficult but down much less are you expecting the business to be up thomas m scalera were kind of targeting more in the flattish john i think the reason why its hard to bring over exactly last years formula is we were able to win platforms in  based on the responsiveness of our rd the responsiveness of our manufacturing where we basically captured some of these opportunities midyear and thats a little different dynamic i think that was a reflection of some of the instability in the marketplace some of our customers were consolidating their supply chains and i think we happened to be very well positioned to grab that share were positioned well to do that in  its just a little harder to project whether or not some of those opportunities may fall our way but right now well continue to assume a reasonable aftermarket and the benefits of what weve been able to capture and win from a european platform perspective and if were able to be more successful in some opportunities that pop up during  thatll be a tailwind for us john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division thats fine it just sounds like with  of the business aftermarket thats  your assumption is pretty conservative for  i wanted to ask you too about these plants in korea and wuxi how much  if you were to kind of look at them in a collective how much are they dragging results perhaps because of startup costs and other things in  and what could that lead to in terms of say benefit in the other years thomas m scalera yes so the pl drag right now has been more pronounced in the motion technologies buildup of wuxi we literally brought that whole facility online putting new staff new training a complete reset of that facility to really something that at this point looks to be fairly stateoftheart in how its operating so we had a bigger set of startup costs in  for wuxi and those were a drag of anywhere  million to  million just to get that kind of up and running it takes a long time in that industry to have your technology and capability certified by your customer so theres a long kind of process where you just have to get everything in line before you can start to produce were glad in q we really hit our stride from a production perspective but we see a lot of additional opportunities going forward so we will probably see some additional costs in  as we take the china volumes even up to the next level in korea weve had minimal pl impact its been more of a capital buildout of that facility and we have a strong operation in korea today thats well capitalized with good engineering and infrastructure talent so well probably have  million or  million of a startup in  but well hit the ground running once that facility is up john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division so its also fair to say im assuming that  should be a more significant contributing year right for both of those plants in terms of their efficiency and cash utilization and so forth denise l ramos yes because they will both be up and running and would have gone through the initial stages of operations the other thing that were doing is in the ip business we are expanding our seneca falls facility also so were  because of the tremendous growth that weve had there as part of leaning up that facility and the growth that weve had were also expanding that along with building the korea facility so we feel really good about this business and where its headed john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division just lastly i know you did that small divestiture of that somewhat unrelated business in the control technologies segment how are you guys feeling about the portfolio do you see any other little divestiture pruning to occur or are we mostly set denise l ramos were mostly set with control technologies we may see a little here or there but nothing significant were aligned around  main platforms in control technologies one being aerospace components and the other being energy absorption and now what were doing is were looking at ways to expand and grow those  platforms that we have really looking at global growth and going at times direct to customers with those  platforms so we have been able to nicely focus and reposition that portfolio around those  key categories john g inch  deutsche bank ag research division so for itt as a whole denise we should not really be expecting any further divestitures even small ones in the coming years is that a fair statement denise l ramos you shouldnt be expecting anything really john we may be as tom mentioned in connectors exiting some product lines but that probably would not be through a sale even though it could be but it would be something very very small operator i would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks denise l ramos well i just want to thank you all for joining us on our call today we feel very good about our first year in  and what we were able to accomplish and were excited about the initiatives that weve laid out for  and what were going to be able to achieve in  so we look forward to talking to you during the next quarter thank
