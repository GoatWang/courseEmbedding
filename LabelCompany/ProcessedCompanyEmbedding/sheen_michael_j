among the seabed the predecessor to the west wing seriously see how many plot points are later repeated in that show this film stars michael douglas as a father widower resident of wisconsin

state dinner with the president of france problems with the middle east and a possible love interest played by annette bening the mans day is certainly never boringand neither is this film michael douglas comes off as a likable guy so its no wonder that he enters this film under high regard and respect unfortunetly his desire to keep his job who doesnt have that these days soon interfears with all that high regard and respect stuff and the white house staff find themselves on shakey grounds annette benings character is definetly more focused as she fights to save the envierment and hopes to get the presidents support for such a plan though a deal is struck both characters have a lot of work ahead of them and will have their character and marols tested along the way this is a film worth watching and owning if you can never seem to catch it on television while there are those who regard this film as a libereal fantasy i remind everyone that its simply a movie and not a documentary if

great movie try it you will like itbyboleoon february  format dvdverified purchasei love this movie it reminds me of dave in that there is an interloper throwing a wrench in the story both are political movies that concentrate on the people rather than strictly about the issues and the actions taken but much more than that is the way the central characters care about the people the pres is a widower raising a teenage daughter and juggling the jobthe daughterthe relationshipand his own time this movie sets that conflict as a core part of the story i love movies that are story centered with well defined characters michael j fox is wonderful he is frantic most of the time he is in motion overreactingselfimportant always sees the worst thing possible and thinks he has everything under control but is fighting to keep his lapses hidden all parts are well written well cast and well acted thanks amazon for including this delightful movie in its sale listsread morecomment one person
