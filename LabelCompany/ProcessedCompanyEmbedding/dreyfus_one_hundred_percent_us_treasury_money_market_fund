of  rule a of the act restricts the quality maturity and diversity of investments by money market funds under this act a money fund mainly buys the highest rated debt which matures in under  months the portfolio must maintain a weighted average maturity wam of  days or less and not invest more than  in any one issuer except for government securities and repurchase agreements unlike most other financial instruments money market funds seek to maintain a stable value of  per share funds are able to pay dividends to investors securities in which money markets may invest include commercial paper repurchase agreements shortterm bonds and other money funds money market securities must be highly liquid and of the highest quality history in  bruce r bent and henry b r brown established the first money market fund it was named the reserve fund and was offered to investors who were interested in preserving their cash and earning a small rate of return several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general which until that time were not widely utilized money market funds in the united states created a solution to the limitations of regulation q which at the time prohibited demand deposit accounts from paying interest and capped the rate of interest on other types of bank accounts at  thus money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts in the s bank interest rates in japan were near zero for an extended period of time to search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits investors used money market funds for shortterm deposits instead however several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in  due to the bankruptcy of enron in which several japanese funds had invested and investors fled into governmentinsured bank accounts since then the total value of money markets have remained low money market funds in europe have always had much lower levels of investments capital than in the united states or japan regulations in the eu have always encouraged investors to use banks rather than money market funds for shortterm deposits breaking the buck money market funds seek a stable net asset value or nav per share which is generally  in the united states they aim to never lose money the  is maintained through the declaration of dividends to shareholders typically daily at an amount equal to the funds net income if a funds nav drops below  it is said that the fund broke the buck for sec registered money funds maintaining the  flat nav is usually accomplished under a provision under rule a of the  act that allows a fund to value its investments at amortized cost rather than market value provided that certain conditions are maintained one such condition involves a sidetest calculation of the nav that uses the market value of the funds investments the funds published amortized value may not exceed this market value by more than  cent per share a comparison that is generally made weekly if the variance does exceed  per share the fund could be considered to have broken the buck and regulators may force it into liquidation breaking the buck has rarely happened up to the  financial crisis only three money funds had broken the buck in the year history of money funds it is important to note that while money market funds are typically managed in a fairly safe manner there would have been many more failures over this period if the companies offering the money market funds had not stepped in when necessary to support their fund by way of infusing capital to reimburse security losses and avoid having the funds break the buck this was done because the expected cost to the business from allowing the fund value to drop—in lost customers and reputation—was greater than the amount needed to bail it out the first money market mutual fund to break the buck was first multifund for daily income fmdi in  liquidating and restating nav at  cents per share an argument has been made that fmdi was not technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years however prospective investors were informed that fmdi would invest solely in shortterm  days money market obligations furthermore the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in rule a of the investment company act of  was not promulgated until  prior to the adoption of this rule a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund which fmdi did seeking higher yield fmdi had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio in order to meet increasing redemptions the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a  loss triggering a restatement of its nav and the first instance of a money market fund breaking the buck the community bankers us government fund broke the buck in  paying investors  cents per share this was only the second failure in the then year history of money funds and there were no further failures for  years the fund had invested a large percentage of its assets into adjustable rate securities as interest rates increased these floating rate securities lost value this fund was an institutional money fund not a retail money fund thus individuals were not directly affected no further failures occurred until september  a month that saw tumultuous events for money funds however as noted above other failures were only averted by infusions of capital from the fund sponsors september  see also financial crisis of – money market funds increasingly became important to the wholesale money market leading up to the crisis their purchases of assetbacked securities and largescale funding of foreign banks shortterm usdenominated debt put the funds in a pivotal position in the marketplace the week of september   to september   was very turbulent for money funds and a key part of financial markets seizing up events on monday september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed for bankruptcy on tuesday september   reserve primary fund the oldest and one of the worlds largest money funds broke the buck when its shares fell to  cents after writing off debt issued by lehman brothers continuing investor anxiety as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy and other pending financial troubles caused significant redemptions from money funds in general as investors redeemed their holdings and funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on redemptions through wednesday september   prime institutional funds saw substantial redemptions retail funds saw net inflows of  billion for a net capital outflow from all funds of  billion to  trillion  in response on friday september   the us department of the treasury announced an optional program to insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund—both retail and institutional—that pays a fee to participate in the program the insurance guaranteed that if a covered fund had broken the buck it would have been restored to  nav the program was similar to the fdic in that it insured depositlike holdings and sought to prevent runs on the bank the guarantee was backed by assets of the treasury departments exchange stabilization fund up to a maximum of  billion this program only covered assets invested in funds before september   and those who sold equities for example during the subsequent market crash and parked their assets in money funds were at risk the program immediately stabilized the system and stanched the outflows but drew criticism from banking organizations including the independent community bankers of america and american bankers association who expected funds to drain out of bank deposits and into newly insured money funds as these latter would combine higher yields with insurance the guarantee program ended on september   with no losses and generated  billion in revenue from the participation fees analysis the crisis which eventually became the catalyst for the emergency economic stabilization act of  almost developed into a run on money funds the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper preventing companies from rolling over their shortterm debt potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt and do not have cash on hand to pay it back they will default on their obligations and may have to file for bankruptcy thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies a debt deflation spiral and serious damage to the real economy as in the great depressioncitation needed the drop in demand resulted in a buyers strike as money funds could not because of redemptions or would not because of fear of redemptions buy commercial paper driving yields up dramatically from around  the previous week to  and funds put their money in treasuries driving their yields close to  this is a bank run in the sense that there is a mismatch in maturities and thus a money fund is a virtual bank the assets of money funds while short term nonetheless typically have maturities of several months while investors can request redemption at any time without waiting for obligations to come due thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions the assets may be liquidated in a fire sale depressing their sale price an earlier crisis occurred in – where the demand for assetbacked commercial paper dropped causing the collapse of some structured investment vehicles as a result of the events the reserve fund liquidated paying shareholders  cents per share statistics the investment company institute reports statistics on money funds weekly as part of its mutual fund statistics as part of its industry statistics including total assets and net flows both for institutional and retail funds it also provides annual reports in the ici fact book at the end of  there were  money market funds in operation with total assets of

fund is a type of government money fund that invests in us treasury bills bonds and notes taxexempt money fund the fund invests primarily in obligations of state and local jurisdictions municipal securities generally exempt from us federal income tax and to some extent state income taxes institutional money fund institutional money funds are high minimum investment low expense share classes that are marketed to corporations governments or fiduciaries they are often set up so that money is swept to them overnight from a companys main operating accounts large national chains often have many accounts with banks all across the country but electronically pull a majority of funds on deposit with them to a concentrated money market fund retail money fund retail money funds are offered primarily to individuals retail money market funds hold roughly  of all money market fund assets fund yields are typically somewhat higher than bank savings accountscitation needed but of course these are different products with differing risks eg money fund accounts are not insured and are not deposit accounts since retail funds generally have higher servicing needs and thus expenses than institutional funds their yields are generally lower than institutional funds sec rule amendments released july   have improved the definition of a retail money fund to be one that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit its shareholders to natural persons money fund sizes recent total net assets for the us fund industry are as follows total net assets  trillion  trillion in prime money funds  billion in treasury money funds  billion in taxexempt total institutional assets outweigh retail by roughly  the largest institutional money fund is the jpmorgan prime money market

the largest money market mutual fund is vanguard prime money market fund nasdaqvmmxx with assets exceeding us billion the largest retail money fund providers include fidelity vanguard nasdaqvmmxx and schwab nasdaqswvxx similar investments money market accounts main article money market account banks in the united states offer savings and money market deposit accounts but these should not be confused with money mutual funds these bank accounts offer higher yields than traditional passbook savings accounts but often with higher minimum balance requirements and limited transactions a money market account may refer to a money market mutual fund a bank money market deposit account mmda or a brokerage sweep free credit balance ultrashort bond funds ultrashort bond funds are mutual funds similar to money market funds that as the name implies invest in bonds with extremely short maturities unlike money market funds however there are no restrictions on the quality of the investments they hold instead ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return since these highrisk securities can experience large swings in price or even default ultrashort bond funds unlike money market funds do not seek to maintain a stable  nav and may lose money or dip below the  mark in the short term finally because they invest in lower quality securities ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of – enhanced cash funds enhanced cash funds are bond funds similar to money market funds in that they aim to provide liquidity and principal preservation but which invest in a wider variety of assets and do not meet the restrictions of sec rule a aim for higher returns have less liquidity do not aim as strongly for stable nav enhanced cash funds will typically invest some of their portfolio in the same assets as money market funds but others in riskier higher yielding less liquid assets such as lowerrated bonds longer maturity foreign currency–denominated debt assetbacked commercial paper abcp mortgagebacked securities mbss structured investment vehicles sivs in general the nav will stay close to  but is expected to fluctuate above and below and will break the buck more often different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash – some consider preservation of principal as paramount and thus take few risks while others see these as more bondlike and an opportunity to increase yield without necessarily preserving principal these are typically available only to institutional investors not retail investors the purpose of enhanced cash funds is not to replace money markets but to fit in the continuum between cash and bonds – to provide a higher yielding investment for more permanent cash that is within ones asset allocation one has a continuum between cash and longterm investments cash – most liquid and least risky but low yielding money markets  cash equivalents enhanced cash longterm bonds and other noncash longterm investments – least liquid and most risky but highest yielding enhanced cash funds were developed due to low spreads in traditional cash equivalents there are also funds which are billed as money market funds but are not a funds do not meet the requirements of the rule in addition to a eligible securities these funds invest in eurodollars and repos repurchase agreements which are similarly liquid and stable to a eligible securities but are not allowed under the regulations systemic risk and regulatory reform a deconstruction of the september  events around money market funds and the resulting fear panic contagion classic bank run emergency need for substantial external propping up etc revealed that the us regulatory system covering the basic extension of credit has had substantial flaws that in hindsight date back at least two decades it has long been understood that regulation around the extension of credit requires substantial levels of integrity throughout the system to the extent regulation can help insure that base levels of integrity persist throughout the chain from borrower to lender and it curtails the overall extension of credit to reasonable levels episodic financial crisis may be averted in the s money market funds began disintermediating banks from their classic interposition between savers and borrowers the funds provided a more direct link with less overhead large banks are regulated by the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency notably the fed is itself owned by the large private banks and controls the overall supply of money in the united states the occ is housed within the treasury department which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multitrillion dollar debt of the us government the overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs actual ongoing tax receipts unquestionably the private banking industry bank regulation the national debt and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the fed and inflation all else being equal allows todays fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars the third major bank regulator designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the federal deposit insurance corporation a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that are failing with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself they also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits from the outset money market funds fell under the jurisdiction of the sec as they appeared to be more like investments most similar to traditional stocks and bonds vs deposits and loans cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers although money market funds are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator the sec has zero mandate to control the supply of money limit the overall extension of credit mitigate against boom and bust cycles etc the sec’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets after adequate disclosure the sec adopts a hands off let the buyer beware attitude to many retail investors money market funds are confusingly similar to traditional bank demand deposits virtually all large money market funds offer check writing ach transfers wiring of funds associated debit and credit cards detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions copies of canceled checks etc this makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual’s account with net asset values reported flat at  despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets an impression of rock solid stability is maintained to help maintain this impression money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses or cut their management fee on an ad hoc and informal basis to maintain that solid appearance of stability to illustrate the various blending and blurring of functions between classic banking and investing activities at money market funds a simplified example will help imagine only retail depositors on one end and sp  corporations borrowing through the commercial paper market on the other the depositors assume extremely short durations  days or less extremely broad diversification hundreds if not thousands of positions very high grade investments after – years of stability the “depositors” here assume safety and move all cash to money markets enjoying the higher interest rates on the borrowing end after – years the sp  corporations become extremely accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets which are very stable initially perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs being a net borrower for only say  days per year they would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance shortterm build ups in inventory and receivables or they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit that was guaranteed to be available to them as they needed it but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least  days out of the year in these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs they were however dependent on these sources to be available to them as needed on an immediate daily basis over time money market fund depositors felt more and more secure and not really at risk likewise on the other end corporations saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets this expands credit it’s also over time clearly longterm borrowing on one end funded by an ondemand depositor on the other with some substantial obfuscation as to what is ultimately going on in between in the wake of the crisis two solutions have been proposed one repeatedly supported over the long term by the gao and others is to consolidate the us financial industry regulators a step along this line has been the creation of the financial stability oversight council to address systemic risk issues that have in the past as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators proposals to merge the sec and cftc have also been made a second solution more focused on money market funds directly is to reregulate them to address the common misunderstandings and to insure that money market depositors who enjoy greater interest rates thoroughly understand the actual risk they are undertaking these risks include substantial interconnectedness between and among money market participants and various other substantial systemic risks factors one solution is to report to money market “depositors” the actual floating net asset value this disclosure has come under strong opposition by fidelity investments the vanguard group blackrock the us chamber of commerce as well as others the sec would normally be the regulator to address the risks to investors taken by money market funds however to date the sec has been internally politically gridlocked the sec is controlled by five commissioners no more than three of which may be the same political party they are also strongly enmeshed with the current mutual fund industry and are largely divorced from traditional banking industry regulation as such the sec is not concerned over overall credit extension money supply or bringing shadow banking under the regulatory umbrella of effective credit regulation as the sec was gridlocked the financial stability oversight council promulgated its own suggested money market reforms and threatens to move forward if the sec doesn’t button it up with an acceptable solution of their own on a timely basis the sec has argued vociferously that this is “their area” and fsoc should back off and let them handle it a viewpoint shared by four former sec chairmen roderick hills david ruder richard breeden and harvey pitt and two former commissioners roel campos and paul s atkins reform sec rule amendments released july   the securities and exchange commission sec issued final rules that are designed to address money funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions and increase the transparency of their risks while preserving as much as possible their benefits there are several key components floating nav required of institutional nongovernment money funds the sec is removing the valuation exemption that permitted these funds whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress to maintain a stable nav ie they will have to transact sales and redemptions as a market valuebased or floating nav rounded to the fourth decimal place eg  fees and gates the sec is giving money fund boards of directors the discretion whether to impose a liquidity fee if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold andor to suspend redemptions temporarily ie to “gate” funds under the same circumstances these amendments will require all nongovernment money funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund other provisions in addition the sec is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios enhancing their stress testing and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the sec and to investors additionally stress testing will be required and a key focus will be placed on the funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least  finally the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds to provide additional information about those funds to the sec see also business and economics portal stock fund bond fund income fund target date fund money market money supply sweep account stable value fund shadow

companies from rolling over their shortterm debt potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt and do not have cash on hand to pay it back they will default on their obligations and may have to file for bankruptcy thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies a debt deflation spiral and serious damage to the real economy as in the great depressioncitation needed the drop in demand resulted in a buyers strike as money funds could not because of redemptions or would not because of fear of redemptions buy commercial paper driving yields up dramatically from around  the previous week to  and funds put their money in treasuries driving their yields close to  this is a bank run in the sense that there is a mismatch in maturities and thus a money fund is a virtual bank the assets of money funds while short term nonetheless typically have maturities of several months while investors can request redemption at any time without waiting for obligations to come due thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions the assets may be liquidated in a fire sale depressing their sale price an earlier

primarily to individuals retail money market funds hold roughly  of all money market fund assets fund yields are typically somewhat higher than bank savings accountscitation needed but of course these are different products with differing risks eg money fund accounts are not insured and are not deposit accounts since retail funds generally have higher servicing needs and thus expenses than

confused with money mutual funds these bank accounts offer higher yields than traditional passbook savings accounts but often with higher minimum balance requirements and limited transactions a money market account may refer to a money market mutual fund a bank money market deposit account mmda or a brokerage sweep free credit balance ultrashort bond funds ultrashort bond funds are mutual funds similar to money market funds that as the name implies invest in bonds with extremely short maturities unlike money market funds however there are no restrictions on the quality of the investments they hold instead ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return since these highrisk securities can experience large swings in price or even default ultrashort bond funds unlike money market funds do not seek to maintain a stable  nav and may lose money or dip below the  mark in the short term finally because they invest in lower quality securities ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of – enhanced cash funds enhanced cash funds are bond funds similar to money market funds in that they aim to provide liquidity and principal preservation but which invest in a wider variety of assets and do not meet the restrictions of sec rule a aim for higher returns have less liquidity do not aim as strongly for stable nav enhanced cash funds will typically invest some of their portfolio in the same assets as money market funds but others in riskier higher yielding less liquid assets such as lowerrated bonds longer maturity foreign currency–denominated debt assetbacked commercial paper abcp mortgagebacked securities mbss structured investment vehicles sivs in general the nav will stay close to  but is expected to fluctuate above and below and will break the buck more often different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash – some consider preservation of principal as paramount and thus take few risks while others see these as more bondlike and an opportunity to increase yield without necessarily preserving principal these are typically available only to institutional investors not retail investors the purpose of enhanced cash funds is not to replace money markets but to fit in the continuum between cash and bonds – to provide a higher yielding investment for more permanent cash that is within ones asset allocation one has a continuum between cash and longterm investments cash – most liquid and least risky but low yielding money markets  cash equivalents enhanced cash longterm bonds and other noncash longterm investments – least liquid and most risky but highest yielding enhanced cash funds were developed due to low spreads in traditional cash equivalents there are also funds which are billed as money market funds but are not a funds do not meet the requirements of the rule in addition to a eligible securities these funds invest in eurodollars and repos repurchase agreements which are similarly liquid and stable to a eligible securities but are not allowed under the regulations systemic risk and regulatory reform a deconstruction of the september  events around money market funds and the resulting fear panic contagion classic bank run emergency need for substantial external propping up etc revealed that the us regulatory system covering the basic extension of credit has had substantial flaws that in hindsight date back at least two decades it has long been understood that regulation around the extension of credit requires substantial levels of integrity throughout the system to the extent regulation can help insure that base levels of integrity persist throughout the chain from borrower to lender and it curtails the overall extension of credit to reasonable levels episodic financial crisis may be averted in the s money market funds began disintermediating banks from their classic interposition between savers and borrowers the funds provided a more direct link with less overhead large banks are regulated by the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency notably the fed is itself owned by the large private banks and controls the overall supply of money in the united states the occ is housed within the treasury department which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multitrillion dollar debt of the us government the overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs actual ongoing tax receipts unquestionably the private banking industry bank regulation the national debt and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the fed and inflation all else being equal allows todays fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars the third major bank regulator designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the federal deposit insurance corporation a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that are failing with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself they also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits from the outset money market funds fell under the jurisdiction of the sec as they appeared to be more like investments most similar to traditional stocks and bonds vs deposits and loans cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers although money market funds are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator the sec has zero mandate to control the supply of money limit the overall extension of credit mitigate against boom and bust cycles etc the sec’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets after adequate disclosure the sec adopts a hands off let the buyer beware attitude to many retail investors money market funds are confusingly similar to traditional bank demand deposits virtually all large money market funds offer check writing ach transfers wiring of funds associated debit and credit cards detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions copies of canceled checks etc this makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual’s account with net asset values reported flat at  despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets an impression of rock solid stability is maintained to help maintain this impression money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses or cut their management fee on an ad hoc and informal basis to maintain that solid appearance of stability to illustrate the various blending and blurring of functions between classic banking and investing activities at money market funds a simplified example will help imagine only retail depositors on one end and sp  corporations borrowing through the commercial paper market on the other the depositors assume extremely short durations  days or less extremely broad diversification hundreds if not thousands of positions very high grade investments after – years of stability the “depositors” here assume safety and move all cash to money markets enjoying the higher interest rates on the borrowing end after – years the sp  corporations become extremely accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets which are very stable initially perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs being a net borrower for only say  days per year they would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance shortterm build ups in inventory and receivables or they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit that was guaranteed to be available to them as they needed it but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least  days out of the year in these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs they were however dependent on these sources to be available to them as needed on an immediate daily basis over time money market fund depositors felt more and more secure and not really at risk likewise on the other end corporations saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets this expands credit it’s also over time clearly longterm borrowing on one end funded by an ondemand depositor on the other with some substantial obfuscation as to what is ultimately going on in between in the wake of the crisis two solutions have been proposed one repeatedly supported over the long term by the gao and others is to consolidate the us financial industry regulators a step along this line has been the creation of the financial stability oversight council to address systemic risk issues that have in the past as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators proposals to merge the sec and cftc have also been made a second solution more focused on money market funds directly is to reregulate them to address the common misunderstandings and to insure that money market depositors who enjoy greater interest rates thoroughly understand the actual risk they are undertaking these risks include substantial interconnectedness between and among money market participants and various other substantial systemic risks factors one solution is to report to money market “depositors” the actual floating net asset value this disclosure has come under strong opposition by fidelity investments the vanguard group blackrock the us chamber of commerce as well as others the sec would normally be the regulator to address the risks to investors taken by money market funds however to date the sec has been internally politically gridlocked the sec is controlled by five commissioners no more than three of which may be the same political party they are also strongly enmeshed with the current mutual fund industry and are largely divorced from traditional banking industry regulation as such the sec is not concerned over overall credit extension money supply or bringing shadow banking under the regulatory umbrella of effective credit regulation as the sec was gridlocked the financial stability oversight council promulgated its own suggested money market reforms and threatens to move forward if the sec doesn’t button it up with an acceptable solution of their own on a timely basis the sec has argued vociferously that this is “their area” and fsoc should back off and let them handle it a viewpoint shared by four former sec chairmen roderick hills david ruder richard breeden and harvey pitt and two former commissioners roel campos and paul s atkins reform sec rule amendments released july   the securities and exchange commission sec issued final rules that are designed to address money funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions and increase the transparency of their risks while preserving as much as possible their benefits there are several key components floating nav required of institutional nongovernment money funds the sec is removing the valuation exemption that permitted these funds whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress to maintain a stable nav ie they will have to transact sales and redemptions as a market valuebased or floating nav rounded to the fourth decimal place eg  fees and gates the sec is giving money fund boards of directors the discretion whether to impose a liquidity fee if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold andor to suspend redemptions temporarily ie to “gate” funds under the same circumstances these amendments will require all nongovernment money funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund other provisions in addition the sec is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios enhancing their stress testing and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the sec and to investors additionally stress testing will be required and a key focus will be placed on the funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least  finally the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds to provide additional

interested in preserving their cash and earning a small rate of return several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general which until that time were not widely utilized money market funds in the united states created a solution to the limitations of regulation q which at the time prohibited demand deposit accounts from paying interest and capped the rate of interest on other types of bank accounts at  thus money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts in

manner there would have been many more failures over this period if the companies offering the money market funds had not stepped in when necessary to support their fund by way of infusing capital to

money market account banks in the united states offer savings and money market deposit accounts but these should not be confused with money mutual funds these bank accounts offer higher yields than

deposit account mmda or a brokerage sweep free credit balance ultrashort bond funds ultrashort bond funds are mutual funds similar to money market funds that as the name implies invest in bonds with extremely short maturities unlike money market funds however there are no restrictions on the quality of the investments they hold instead ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return since these highrisk securities can experience large swings in price or even default ultrashort bond funds unlike money market funds do not seek to maintain a stable  nav and may lose money or dip below the  mark in the short term finally because they invest in lower quality securities ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of – enhanced cash funds enhanced cash funds are bond funds similar to money market funds in that they aim to provide liquidity and principal preservation but which invest in a wider variety of assets and do not meet the restrictions of sec rule a aim for higher returns have less liquidity do not aim as strongly for stable nav enhanced cash funds will typically invest some of their portfolio in the same assets as money market funds but others in riskier higher yielding less liquid assets such as lowerrated bonds longer maturity foreign currency–denominated debt assetbacked commercial paper abcp mortgagebacked securities mbss structured investment vehicles sivs in general the nav will stay close to  but is expected to fluctuate above and below and will break the buck more often different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash – some consider preservation of principal as paramount and thus take few risks while others see these as more bondlike and an opportunity to increase yield without necessarily preserving principal these are typically available only to institutional investors not retail investors the purpose of enhanced cash funds is not to replace money markets but to fit in the continuum between cash and bonds – to provide a higher yielding investment for more permanent cash that is within ones asset allocation one has a continuum between cash and longterm investments cash – most liquid and least risky but low yielding money markets  cash equivalents enhanced cash longterm bonds and other noncash longterm investments – least liquid and most risky but highest yielding enhanced cash funds were developed due to low spreads in traditional cash equivalents there are also funds which are billed as money market funds but are not a funds do not meet the requirements of the rule in addition to a eligible securities these funds invest in eurodollars and repos repurchase agreements which are similarly liquid and stable to a eligible securities but are not allowed under the regulations systemic risk and regulatory reform a deconstruction of the september  events around money market funds and the resulting fear panic contagion classic bank run emergency need for substantial external propping up etc revealed that the us regulatory system covering the basic extension of credit has had substantial flaws that in hindsight date back at least two decades it has long been understood that regulation around the extension of credit requires substantial levels of integrity throughout the system to the extent regulation can help insure that base levels of integrity persist throughout the chain from borrower to lender and it curtails the overall extension of credit to reasonable levels episodic financial crisis may be averted in the s money market funds began disintermediating banks from their classic interposition between savers and borrowers the funds provided a more direct link with less overhead large banks are regulated by the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency notably the fed is itself owned by the large private banks and controls the overall supply of money in the united states the occ is housed within the treasury department which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multitrillion dollar debt of the us government the overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs actual ongoing tax receipts unquestionably the private banking industry bank regulation the national debt and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the fed and inflation all else being equal allows todays fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars the third major bank regulator designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the federal deposit insurance corporation a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that are failing with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself they also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits from the outset money market funds fell under the jurisdiction of the sec as they appeared to be more like investments most similar to traditional stocks and bonds vs deposits and loans cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers although money market funds are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator the sec has zero mandate to control the supply of money limit the overall extension of credit mitigate against boom and bust cycles etc the sec’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets after adequate disclosure the sec adopts a hands off let the buyer beware attitude to many retail investors money market funds are confusingly similar to traditional bank demand deposits virtually all large money market funds offer check writing ach transfers wiring of funds associated debit and credit cards detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions copies of canceled checks etc this makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual’s account with net asset values reported flat at  despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets an impression of rock solid stability is maintained to help maintain this impression money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses or cut their management fee on an ad hoc and informal basis to maintain that solid appearance of stability to illustrate the various blending and blurring of functions between classic banking and investing activities at money market funds a simplified example will help imagine only retail depositors on one end and sp  corporations borrowing through the commercial paper market on the other the depositors assume extremely short durations  days or less extremely broad diversification hundreds if not thousands of positions very high grade investments after – years of stability the “depositors” here assume safety and move all cash to money markets enjoying the higher interest rates on the borrowing end after – years the sp  corporations become extremely accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets which are very stable initially perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs being a net borrower for only say  days per year they would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance shortterm build ups in inventory and receivables or they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit that was guaranteed to be available to them as they needed it but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least  days out of the year in these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs they were however dependent on these sources to be available to them as needed on an immediate daily basis over time money market fund depositors felt more and more secure and not really at risk likewise on the other end corporations saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets this expands credit it’s also over time clearly longterm borrowing on one end funded by an ondemand depositor on the other with some substantial obfuscation as to what is ultimately going on in between in the wake of the crisis two solutions have been proposed one repeatedly supported over the long term by the gao and others is to consolidate the us financial industry regulators a step along this line has been the creation of the financial stability oversight council to address systemic risk issues that have in the past as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators proposals to merge the sec and cftc have also been made a second solution more focused on money market funds directly is to reregulate them to address the common misunderstandings and to insure that money market depositors who enjoy greater interest rates thoroughly understand the actual risk they are undertaking these risks include substantial interconnectedness between and among money market participants and various other substantial systemic risks factors one solution is to report to money market “depositors” the actual floating net asset value this disclosure has come under strong opposition by fidelity investments the vanguard group blackrock the us chamber of commerce as well as others the sec would normally be the regulator to address the risks to investors taken by money market funds however to date the sec has been internally politically gridlocked the sec is controlled by five commissioners no more than three of which may be the same political party they are also strongly enmeshed with the current mutual fund industry and are largely divorced from traditional banking industry regulation as such the sec is not concerned over overall credit extension money supply or bringing shadow banking under the regulatory umbrella of effective credit regulation as the sec was gridlocked the financial stability oversight council promulgated its own suggested money market reforms and threatens to move forward if the sec doesn’t button it up with an acceptable solution of their own on a timely basis the sec has argued vociferously that this is “their area” and fsoc should back off and let them handle it a viewpoint shared by four former sec chairmen roderick hills david ruder richard breeden and harvey pitt and two former commissioners roel campos and paul s atkins reform sec rule amendments released july   the securities and exchange commission sec issued final rules that are designed to address money funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions and increase the transparency of their risks while preserving as much as possible their benefits there are several key components floating nav required of institutional nongovernment money funds the sec is removing the valuation exemption that permitted these funds whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress to maintain a stable nav ie they will have to transact sales and redemptions as a market valuebased or floating nav rounded to the fourth decimal place eg  fees and gates the sec is giving money fund boards of directors the discretion whether to impose a liquidity fee if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold andor to suspend redemptions temporarily ie to “gate” funds under the same circumstances these amendments will require all nongovernment money funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund other provisions in addition the sec is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios enhancing their stress testing and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the sec and to investors additionally stress testing will be required and a key focus will be placed on the funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least  finally the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds to provide additional information about those funds to the sec see also business and economics portal stock fund bond fund income fund target date fund

rate of return several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general which until that time were not widely utilized money market funds in the united states created a solution to the limitations of regulation q which at the time prohibited demand deposit accounts from paying interest and capped the rate of interest on other types of bank accounts at  thus money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts in the s bank interest rates in japan were near zero

very stable initially perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs being a net borrower for only say  days per year they would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance shortterm build ups in inventory and receivables or they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit that was guaranteed to be available to them as they needed it but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least  days out of the year in these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs they were however dependent on these sources to be available to them as needed on an immediate daily basis over time money market fund depositors felt more and more secure and not really at risk likewise on the other end corporations saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets this expands credit it’s also over time clearly longterm borrowing on one end funded by an ondemand depositor on the other with some substantial obfuscation as to what is ultimately going on in between in the wake of the crisis two solutions have been proposed one repeatedly supported over the long term by the gao and others is to consolidate the us financial industry regulators a step along this line has been the creation of the financial stability oversight council to address systemic risk issues that have in the past as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators proposals to merge the sec and cftc have also been made a second solution more focused on money market funds directly is to reregulate them to address the common misunderstandings and to insure that money market depositors who enjoy greater interest rates thoroughly understand the actual risk they are undertaking these risks include substantial interconnectedness between and among money market participants and various other substantial systemic risks factors one solution is to report to money market “depositors” the actual floating net asset value this disclosure has come under strong opposition by fidelity investments the vanguard group blackrock the us chamber of commerce as well as others the sec would normally be the regulator to address the risks to investors taken by money market funds however to date the sec has been internally politically gridlocked the sec is controlled by five commissioners no more than three of which may be the same political party they are also strongly enmeshed with the current mutual fund industry and are largely divorced from traditional banking industry regulation as such the sec is not concerned over overall credit extension money supply or bringing shadow banking under the regulatory umbrella of effective credit regulation as the sec was gridlocked the financial stability oversight council promulgated its own suggested money market reforms and threatens to move forward if the sec doesn’t button it up with an acceptable solution of their own on a timely basis the sec has argued vociferously that this is “their area” and fsoc should back off and let them handle it a viewpoint shared by four former sec chairmen roderick hills david ruder richard breeden and harvey pitt and two former commissioners roel campos and paul s atkins reform sec rule amendments released july   the securities and exchange commission sec issued final rules that are designed to address money funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions and increase the transparency of their risks while preserving as much as possible their benefits there are several key components floating nav required of institutional nongovernment money funds the sec is removing the valuation exemption that permitted these funds whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress to maintain a stable nav ie they will have to transact sales and redemptions as a market valuebased or floating nav rounded to the fourth decimal place eg  fees and gates the sec is giving money fund boards of directors the discretion whether to impose a liquidity fee if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold andor to suspend redemptions temporarily ie to “gate” funds under the same circumstances these amendments will require all nongovernment money funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund other provisions in addition the sec is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios enhancing their stress testing and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the sec and to investors additionally stress testing will be required and a key focus will be placed on the funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least  finally the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds to provide additional

risks money market funds in the united states are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec under the investment company act of  rule a of the act restricts the quality maturity and diversity of investments by money market funds under this act a money fund mainly buys the highest rated debt which matures in under  months the portfolio must maintain a weighted average maturity wam of  days or less and not invest more than  in any one issuer except for government securities and repurchase agreements unlike most other financial instruments money market funds seek to maintain a stable value of  per share funds are able to pay dividends to investors securities in which money markets may invest include commercial paper repurchase agreements shortterm bonds and other money funds money market securities must be highly liquid and of the highest quality history in  bruce r bent and henry b r brown established the first money market fund it was named the reserve fund and was offered to investors who were interested in preserving their cash and earning a small rate of return several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general which until that time were not widely utilized money market funds in the united states created a solution to the limitations of regulation q which at the time prohibited demand deposit accounts from paying interest and capped the rate of interest on other types of bank accounts at  thus money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts in the s bank interest rates in japan were near zero for an extended period of time to search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits investors used money market funds for shortterm deposits instead however several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in  due to the bankruptcy of enron in which several japanese funds had invested and investors fled into governmentinsured bank accounts since then the total value of money markets have remained low money market funds in europe have always had much lower levels of investments capital than in the united states or japan regulations in the eu have always encouraged investors to use banks rather than money market funds for shortterm deposits breaking the buck money market funds seek a stable net asset value or nav per share which is generally  in the united states they aim to never lose money the  is maintained through the declaration of dividends to shareholders typically daily at an amount equal to the funds net income if a funds nav drops below  it is said that the fund broke the buck for sec registered money funds maintaining the  flat nav is usually accomplished under a provision under rule a of the  act that allows a fund to value its investments at amortized cost rather than market value provided that certain conditions are maintained one such condition involves a sidetest calculation of the nav that uses the market value of the funds investments the funds published amortized value may not exceed this market value by more than  cent per share a comparison that is generally made weekly if the variance does exceed  per share the fund could be considered to have broken the buck and regulators may force it into liquidation breaking the buck has rarely happened up to the  financial crisis only three money funds had broken the buck in the year history of money funds it is important to note that while money market funds are typically managed in a fairly safe manner there would have been many more failures over this period if the companies offering the money market funds had not stepped in when necessary to support their fund by way of infusing capital to reimburse security losses and avoid having the funds break the buck this was done because the expected cost to the business from allowing the fund value to drop—in lost customers and reputation—was greater than the amount needed to bail it out the first money market mutual fund to break the buck was first multifund for daily income fmdi in  liquidating and restating nav at  cents per share an argument has been made that fmdi was not technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years however prospective investors were informed that fmdi would invest solely in shortterm  days money market obligations furthermore the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in rule a of the investment company act of  was not promulgated until  prior to the adoption of this rule a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund which fmdi did seeking higher yield fmdi had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio in order to meet increasing redemptions the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a  loss triggering a restatement of its nav and the first instance of a money market fund breaking the buck the community bankers us government fund broke the buck in  paying investors  cents per share this was only the second failure in the then year history of money funds and there were no further failures for  years the fund had invested a large percentage of its assets into adjustable rate securities as interest rates increased these floating rate securities lost value this fund was an institutional money fund not a retail money fund thus individuals were not directly affected no further failures occurred until september  a month that saw tumultuous events for money funds however as noted above other failures were only averted by infusions of capital from the fund sponsors september  see also financial crisis of – money market funds increasingly became important to the wholesale money market leading up to the crisis their purchases of assetbacked securities and largescale funding of foreign banks shortterm usdenominated debt put the funds in a pivotal position in the marketplace the week of september   to september   was very turbulent for money funds and a key part of financial markets seizing up events on monday september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed for bankruptcy on tuesday september   reserve primary fund the oldest and one of the worlds largest money funds broke the buck when its shares fell to  cents after writing off debt issued by lehman brothers continuing investor anxiety as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy and other pending financial troubles caused significant redemptions from money funds in general as investors redeemed their holdings and funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on redemptions through wednesday september   prime institutional funds saw substantial redemptions retail funds saw net inflows of  billion for a net capital outflow from all funds of  billion to  trillion  in response on friday september   the us department of the treasury announced an optional program to insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund—both retail and institutional—that pays a fee to participate in the program the insurance guaranteed that if a covered fund had broken the buck it would have been restored to  nav the program was similar to the fdic in that it insured depositlike holdings and sought to prevent runs on the bank the guarantee was backed by assets of the treasury departments exchange stabilization fund up to a maximum of  billion this program only covered assets invested in funds before september   and those who sold equities for example during the subsequent market crash and parked their assets in money funds were at risk the program immediately stabilized the system and stanched the outflows but drew criticism from banking organizations including the independent community bankers of america and american bankers association who expected funds to drain out of bank deposits and into newly insured money funds as these latter would combine higher yields with insurance the guarantee program ended on september   with no losses and generated  billion in revenue from the participation fees analysis the crisis which eventually became the catalyst for the emergency economic stabilization act of  almost developed into a run on money funds the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper preventing companies from rolling over their shortterm debt potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt and do not have cash on hand to pay it back they will default on their obligations and may have to file for bankruptcy thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies a debt deflation spiral and serious damage to the real economy as in the great depressioncitation needed the drop in demand resulted in a buyers strike as money funds could not because of redemptions or would not because of fear of redemptions buy commercial paper driving yields up dramatically from around  the previous week to  and funds put their money in treasuries driving their yields close to  this is a bank run in the sense that there is a mismatch in maturities and thus a money fund is a virtual bank the assets of money funds while short term nonetheless typically have maturities of several months while investors can request redemption at any time without waiting for obligations to come due thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions the assets may be liquidated in a fire sale depressing their sale price an earlier crisis occurred in – where the demand for assetbacked commercial paper dropped causing the collapse of some structured investment vehicles as a result of the events the reserve fund liquidated paying shareholders  cents per share statistics the investment company institute reports statistics on money funds weekly as part of its mutual fund statistics as part of its industry statistics including

risk issues that have in the past as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators proposals to merge the sec and cftc have also been made a second solution more focused on money market funds directly is to reregulate them to address the common misunderstandings and to insure that money market depositors who enjoy greater interest rates thoroughly understand the actual risk they are undertaking these risks include substantial interconnectedness between and among money market participants and various other substantial systemic risks factors one solution is to report to money market “depositors” the actual floating net asset value this disclosure has come under strong opposition by fidelity investments

risks money market funds in the united states are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec under the investment company act of  rule a of the act restricts the quality maturity and diversity of investments by money market funds under this act a money fund mainly buys the highest rated debt which matures in under  months the portfolio must maintain a weighted average maturity wam of  days or less and not invest more than  in any one issuer except for government securities and repurchase agreements unlike most other financial instruments money market funds seek to maintain a stable value of  per share funds are able to pay dividends to investors securities in which money markets may invest include commercial paper repurchase agreements shortterm bonds and other money funds money market securities must be highly liquid and of the highest quality history in  bruce r bent and henry b r brown established the first money market fund it was named the reserve fund and was offered to investors who were interested in preserving their cash and earning a small rate of return several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general which until that time were not widely utilized money market funds in the united states created a solution to the limitations of regulation q which at the time prohibited demand deposit accounts from paying interest and capped the rate of interest on other types of bank accounts at  thus money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts in the s bank interest rates in japan were near zero for an extended period of time to search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits investors used money market funds for shortterm deposits instead however several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in  due to the bankruptcy of enron in which several japanese funds had invested and investors fled into governmentinsured bank accounts since then the total value of money markets have remained low money market funds in europe have always had much lower levels of investments capital than in the united states or japan regulations in the eu have always encouraged investors to use banks rather than money market funds for shortterm deposits breaking the buck money market funds seek a stable net asset value or nav per share which is generally  in the united states they aim to never lose money the  is maintained through the declaration of dividends to shareholders typically daily at an amount equal to the funds net income if a funds nav drops below  it is said that the fund broke the buck for sec registered money funds maintaining the  flat nav is usually accomplished under a provision under rule a of the  act that allows a fund to value its investments at amortized cost rather than market value provided that certain conditions are maintained one such condition involves a sidetest calculation of the nav that uses the market value of the funds investments the funds published amortized value may not exceed this market value by more than  cent per share a comparison that is generally made weekly if the variance does exceed  per share the fund could be considered to have broken the buck and regulators may force it into liquidation breaking the buck has rarely happened up to the  financial crisis only three money funds had broken the buck in the year history of money funds it is important to note that while money market funds are typically managed in a fairly safe manner there would have been many more failures over this period if the companies offering the money market funds had not stepped in when necessary to support their fund by way of infusing capital to reimburse security losses and avoid having the funds break the buck this was done because the expected cost to the business from allowing the fund value to drop—in lost customers and reputation—was greater than the amount needed to bail it out the first money market mutual fund to break the buck was first multifund for daily income fmdi in  liquidating and restating nav at  cents per share an argument has been made that fmdi was not technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years however prospective investors were informed that fmdi would invest solely in shortterm  days money market obligations furthermore the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in rule a of the investment company act of  was not promulgated until  prior to the adoption of this rule a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund which fmdi did seeking higher yield fmdi had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio in order to meet increasing redemptions the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a  loss triggering a restatement of its nav and the first instance of a money market fund breaking the buck the community bankers us government fund broke the buck in  paying investors  cents per share this was only the second failure in the then year history of money funds and there were no further failures for  years the fund had invested a large percentage of its assets into adjustable rate securities as interest rates increased these floating rate securities lost value this fund was an institutional money fund not a retail money fund thus individuals were not directly affected no further failures occurred until september  a month that saw tumultuous events for money funds however as noted above other failures were only averted by infusions of capital from the fund sponsors september  see also financial crisis of – money market funds increasingly became important to the wholesale money market leading up to the crisis their purchases of assetbacked securities and largescale funding of foreign banks shortterm usdenominated debt put the funds in a pivotal position in the marketplace the week of september   to september   was very turbulent for money funds and a key part of financial markets seizing up events on monday september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed for bankruptcy on tuesday september   reserve primary fund the oldest and one of the worlds largest money funds broke the buck when its shares fell to  cents after writing off debt issued by lehman brothers continuing investor anxiety as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy and other pending financial troubles caused significant redemptions from money funds in general as investors redeemed their holdings and funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on redemptions through wednesday september   prime institutional funds saw substantial redemptions retail funds saw net inflows of  billion for a net capital outflow from all funds of  billion to  trillion  in response on friday september   the us department of the treasury announced an optional program to insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund—both retail and institutional—that pays a fee to participate in the program the insurance guaranteed that if a covered fund had broken the buck it would have been restored to  nav the program was similar to the fdic in that it insured depositlike holdings and sought to prevent runs on the bank the guarantee was backed by assets of the treasury departments exchange stabilization fund up to a maximum of  billion this program only covered assets invested in funds before september   and those who sold equities for example during the subsequent market crash and parked their assets in money funds were at risk the program immediately stabilized the system and stanched the outflows but drew criticism from banking organizations including the independent community bankers of america and american bankers association who expected funds to drain out of bank deposits and into newly insured money funds as these latter would combine higher yields with insurance the guarantee program ended on september   with no losses and generated  billion in revenue from the participation fees analysis the crisis which eventually became the catalyst for the emergency economic stabilization act of  almost developed into a run on money funds the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper preventing companies from rolling over their shortterm debt potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt and do not have cash on hand to pay it back they will default on their obligations and may have to file for bankruptcy thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies a debt deflation spiral and serious damage to the real economy as in the great depressioncitation needed the drop in demand resulted in a buyers strike as money funds could not because of redemptions or would not because of fear of redemptions buy commercial paper driving yields up dramatically from around  the previous week to  and funds put their money in treasuries driving their yields close to  this is a bank run in the sense that there is a mismatch in maturities and thus a money fund is a virtual bank the assets of money funds while short term nonetheless typically have maturities of several months while investors can request redemption at any time without waiting for obligations to come due thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions the assets may be liquidated in a fire sale depressing their sale price an earlier crisis occurred in – where the demand for assetbacked commercial paper dropped causing the collapse of some structured investment vehicles as a result of the events the reserve fund liquidated paying shareholders  cents per share statistics the investment company institute reports statistics on money funds weekly as part of its mutual fund statistics as part of its industry statistics including total assets and net flows both for institutional and retail funds it also provides annual reports in the ici fact book at the end of  there were  money market funds in operation with total assets of nearly us trillion of this  trillion retail money market funds had  billion in assets under management aum institutional funds had  trillion under management types and size of money funds in the united states the fund industry and its largest trade organization the investment company institute generally categorize money funds into the type of investment strategy prime treasury or taxexempt as

government and agencies can be considered of any money fund that is not a treasury or taxexempt fund government and treasury money funds a government money fund as of the secs july   rule release is

fund is a type of government money fund that invests in us treasury bills bonds and notes taxexempt money fund the fund invests primarily in obligations of state and local jurisdictions municipal securities generally exempt from us federal income tax and to some extent state income taxes institutional money fund institutional money funds are high minimum investment low expense share classes that are marketed to corporations governments or fiduciaries they are often set up so that money is swept to them overnight from a companys main operating accounts large national chains often have many accounts with banks all across the country but electronically pull a majority of funds on deposit with them to a concentrated money market fund retail money fund retail money funds are offered primarily to individuals retail money market funds hold roughly  of all money market fund assets fund yields are typically somewhat higher than bank savings accountscitation needed but of course these are different products with differing risks eg money fund accounts are not insured and are not deposit accounts since retail funds generally have higher servicing needs and thus expenses than institutional funds their yields are generally lower than institutional funds sec rule amendments released july   have improved the definition of a retail money fund to be one that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit its shareholders to natural persons money fund sizes recent total net assets for the us fund industry are as follows total net assets  trillion  trillion in prime money funds  billion in treasury money funds  billion in taxexempt total institutional assets outweigh retail by roughly  the largest institutional money fund is the jpmorgan prime money market

the largest money market mutual fund is vanguard prime money market fund nasdaqvmmxx with assets exceeding us billion the largest retail money fund providers include fidelity vanguard nasdaqvmmxx and schwab nasdaqswvxx similar investments money market accounts main article money market account banks in the united states offer savings and money market deposit accounts but these should not be confused with money mutual funds these bank accounts offer higher yields than traditional passbook savings accounts but often with higher minimum balance requirements and limited transactions a money market account may refer to a money market mutual fund a bank money market deposit account mmda or a brokerage sweep free credit balance ultrashort bond funds ultrashort bond funds are mutual funds similar to money market funds that as the name implies invest in bonds with extremely short maturities unlike money market funds however there are no restrictions on the quality of the investments they hold instead ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return since these highrisk securities can experience large swings in price or even default ultrashort bond funds unlike money market funds do not seek to maintain a stable  nav and may lose money or dip below the  mark in the short term finally because they invest in lower quality securities ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of – enhanced cash funds enhanced cash funds are bond funds similar to money market funds in that they aim to provide liquidity and principal preservation but which invest in a wider variety of assets and do not meet the restrictions of sec rule a aim for higher returns have less liquidity do not aim as strongly for stable nav enhanced cash funds will typically invest some of their portfolio in the same assets as money market funds but others in riskier higher yielding less liquid assets such as lowerrated bonds longer maturity foreign currency–denominated debt assetbacked commercial paper abcp mortgagebacked securities mbss structured investment vehicles sivs in general the nav will stay close to  but is expected to fluctuate above and below and will break the buck more often different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash – some consider preservation of principal as paramount and thus take few risks while others see these as more bondlike and an opportunity to increase yield without necessarily preserving principal these are typically available only to institutional investors not retail investors the purpose of enhanced cash funds is not to replace money markets but to fit in the continuum between cash and bonds – to provide a higher yielding investment for more permanent cash that is within ones asset allocation one has a continuum between cash and longterm investments cash – most liquid and least risky but low yielding money markets  cash equivalents enhanced cash longterm bonds and other noncash longterm investments – least liquid and most risky but highest yielding enhanced cash funds were developed due to low spreads in traditional cash equivalents there are also funds which are billed as money market funds but are not a funds do not meet the requirements of the rule in addition to a eligible securities these funds invest in eurodollars and repos repurchase agreements which are similarly liquid and stable to a eligible securities but are not allowed under the regulations systemic risk and regulatory reform a deconstruction of the september  events around money market funds and the resulting fear panic contagion classic bank run emergency need for substantial external propping up etc revealed that the us regulatory system covering the basic extension of credit has had substantial flaws that in hindsight date back at least two decades it has long been understood that regulation around the extension of credit requires substantial levels of integrity throughout the system to the extent regulation can help insure that base levels of integrity persist throughout the chain from borrower to lender and it curtails the overall extension of credit to reasonable levels episodic financial crisis may be averted in the s money market funds began disintermediating banks from their classic interposition between savers and borrowers the funds provided a more direct link with less overhead large banks are regulated by the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency notably the fed is itself owned by the large private banks and controls the overall supply of money in the united states the occ is housed within the treasury department which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multitrillion dollar debt of the us government the overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs actual ongoing tax receipts unquestionably the private banking industry bank regulation the national debt and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the fed and inflation all else being equal allows todays fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars the third major bank regulator designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the federal deposit insurance corporation a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that are failing with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself they also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits from the outset money market funds fell under the jurisdiction of the sec as they appeared to be more like investments most similar to traditional stocks and bonds vs deposits and loans cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers although money market funds are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator the sec has zero mandate to control the supply of money limit the overall extension of credit mitigate against boom and bust cycles etc the sec’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets after adequate disclosure the sec adopts a hands off let the buyer beware attitude to many retail investors money market funds are confusingly similar to traditional bank demand deposits virtually all large money market funds offer check writing ach transfers wiring of funds associated debit and credit cards detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions copies of canceled checks etc this makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual’s account with net asset values reported flat at  despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets an impression of rock solid stability is maintained to help maintain this impression money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses or cut their management fee on an ad hoc and informal basis to maintain that solid appearance of stability to illustrate the various blending and blurring of functions between classic banking and investing activities at money market funds a simplified example will help imagine only retail depositors on one end and sp  corporations borrowing through the commercial paper market on the other the depositors assume extremely short durations  days or less extremely broad diversification hundreds if not thousands of positions very high grade investments after – years of stability the “depositors” here assume safety and move all cash to money markets enjoying the higher interest rates on the borrowing end after – years the sp  corporations become extremely accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets which are very stable initially perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs being a net borrower for only say  days per year they would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance shortterm build ups in inventory and receivables or they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit that was guaranteed to be available to them as they needed it but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least  days out of the year in these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity
