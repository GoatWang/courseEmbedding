of the parent companys  c million revenues but videotrons cable system offers more than the standard package of cable television networks and programs while the rest of the world has dragged its feet chagnon has led videotron firmly into the untested waters of interactive television after creating the worlds first interactive television service videoway in the first half of the s videotron is now looking to expand the companys interactive programming under the moniker universality bidirectionaltiy and interactivity or ubi pronounced youbee videotron has joined with canada post the national bank of canada lotoquebec hydroquebec and the united states hearst corporation to launch a true twoway interactive television technology by mid ubi has been placed in more than  homes with plans calling for more than  percent penetration of videotrons subscriber base within five years videotrons investment represents  percent of the ubi system videotron has been less successful in developing its international operations in  the company began pulling out of the uk where it provided cable television and other telecommunications services to the greater london area through its  percent ownership of videotron holdings plc videotron also provides wireless cable and private cable television services to the united states through two joint ventures wireless holdings inc and optel inc primarily in the florida and california markets videotron however has been attempting to exit these markets as well founding a cable empire in the s chagnon a graduate of french canadas vocational school system built his first business an electrical contracting service in the late s and early s a large share of that companys business was in laying coaxial cable for the stillemerging cable television industry in  however chagnonafter reading an article claiming that cable television would become a recessionresistant industrydecided to sell his business and enter this new industry at the age of  and with  million from the sale of his electrical contracting company chagnon established his own cable television operations called le groupe videotron ltée in montreal canada while building his new business chagnon also went back to school attending night classes and earning a business degree from the university of montreal until  videotron remained a relatively modest operation reaching revenues of c million on a subscriber base of just  but chagnon determined to expand the company reaching an agreement for financial backing from le caisse de dépôt et placement du quebec which gave the quebecois governments official fund manger a  percent voting stake in videotron chagnon purchased a far larger competitor national cablevision for  million the purchase paved the way for the company to expand rapidly through the sand by the end of the decade the company had acquired some  cable companies building a network of more than one million subscribers with more than c million in revenues meanwhile canada itself had become one of the mostcabled countries in the world with a penetration of some seven million of the total  million canadian households by then too videotron had gone international chagnon first attempted to bring his frenchspeaking services to france but legislative impediments in that countrycable operators were required to offer services through third partiesthwarted videotrons  french entry cable televisions penetration in france would remain stalled until well into the s instead chagnon looked to great britain where legislation enacted in  at last opened the potential for offering television programming services beyond that countrys four channel the two public feebased bbc channels and two privately owned channels television system in  the companys  percentowned jointventure with bell canada enterprises inc videotron holdings plc was awarded franchises in london and in southamptonwinchester with a potential reach of more than one million subscribers the company began building a cable infrastructure and by  had already connected some  subscribers to its channel cable offerings an interactive vision for the s chagnon was not content merely to provide traditional television programming as early as  he reasoned that television could offer a variety of multimedia services and particularly through cable held the potential of providing an interactive experience to viewers videotron started out by offering services such as entertainment listings a dating service and real estate and employment advertising a person trying to sell their home for example paid  to place an ad consisting of  or more slides of the house along with text and voice descriptions of the property if the property sold the homeowner paid videotron an additional  the dating service also proved popular attracting some  members by the end of the decade chagnons vision however looked beyond such relatively passive services toward a richer interactive television environment in  videotron purchased telemetropole a quebecbased broadcaster with an eye on producing the programming it needed for future interactive services and by the middle of the decade chagnon had found the technology to support his vision videotron obtained canadian and european licenses for an interactive television technology developed by actv domestic corp in  and the following year purchased shares in that company videotron itself worked with actvs technology investing some  million to develop its videoway terminal consisting of a settop unit which incorporated a cable converter and a small computer processor a keyboard and a remote control the videoway service would offer as many as  services ranging from onscreen caption and subtitling to weather reports and other information services but the true thrust of the service was in its interactive programming using four buttons on the remote control a subscriber could choose from among four channels broadcasting simultaneously during a sports event for example the subscriber had the ability to choose from several camera angles from which to view the event or from a channel offering continuous instant replays subscribers who paid a fee for the service on top of their regular cable bill could also tailor a news broadcast to their interests bypassing the sports reports for example in favor of more business news viewers were also able to participate in game shows competing against players in the studio viewers would also be able to download and play a range of video games while the service was still limited to oneway communicationthe route back was made through the telephone the videoway terminal was able to switch instantaneously among the four channels giving the viewer a feeling of interactivity videotron was not the only one interested in interactive television other companies were testing interactive technologies including the actv and videoway systems in the united states but videotron was the first to go beyond testing and actually roll out the service to its subscribers videoway was launched in september  and by september  the service had been placed in  homes in canada that number more than doubled by the beginning of  by  the service had penetrated some  percent of videotrons canadian subscriber base representing nearly  homes the service had also been introduced into england reaching some  of videotrons  uk cable customers by the mids videoway represented approximately  percent of the companys revenues which gained steadily nearing c million by  while videoway represented a breakthrough in television programming it remained essentially a oneway transmission and not the twoway truly interactive experience that had captured the industrys attention and as early as  videotron seemed under threat to be passed by in what was still believed to be the coming interactive television age other companies including time warner and att were developing true twoway television technologies videotron in order to upgrade its own system was faced with an investment of some  million chagnon went in search of partners lining up some  companies such as sears canada and quaker oats to provide direct marketing services and attracting interactive services from the canada post and banque national du canada a year later however videotron switched tracks instead of upgrading videoway which the company now dubbed its phase i interactive system the company instead eyed developing an entirely new interactive system forming a consortium dubbed universality bidirectionality interactivity or ubi with canada post banque national du canada hearst corp sociétés des loteries du quebec and the hydroquebec the governmentowned utility videotron announced its intention to develop a new settop interactive television device the phase ii device based on a powerpc processor would operate through a  mhz bandwidth along fiber optic cabling using both analog and digital signals and the newly developing mpeg ii video compression standard settop units would be equipped with smart card readers to enable secure financial transactions unlike the feebased videoway service ubi was to be provided free to videotrons cable subscribers with the devices and services paid for by advertising and revenues generated through use of the interactive services ubi attracted strong interest among service providers which saw the ability to incorporate interactive services as part of marketing and advertising promotions among the services to be included were yellow pages listings provided by hearst corp email messaging service provided by canada post and online banking provided by banque national du canada in march  ubi took a step forward when videotron and ibm reached agreement to develop the settop box technology ibm later withdrew from the partnership leaving videotron to complete the development of the ubi system rollout of ubi was initially planned for january  in the small northern quebec city of chicoutimi with plans to reach an  percent penetration rate of the companys subscriber base by the year  the cost for implementing the service to this extent was estimated at c million while videotron was developing ubi the company was also extending its range in august  the companys wireless holdings joint venture with transworld telecommunications inc of salt lake city acquired wireless cable licenses in california and south carolina adding to its wireless cable franchises in san francisco san jose spokane and tampa later that year the companys superclub video store subsidiary acquired video supreme a quebecbased chain of  stores in the uk the deregulation of the telecommunications industry enabled videotron to begin offering telephone services to its subscriber area which included the westminster financial district of london by then videotron had built the largest fiber optic network in england and its cable service was the largest in london with a potential reach of more than  million households its actual subscriber base however totalled only slightly more than  cable subscribers and just under  telephone customers ubi missed its targeted start date meanwhile the company was preparing a new move to build its cable television group in november  videotron reached an agreement with cfcf to swap assets in a deal worth some c under the deal videotron would acquire cfcfs  cable subscribers in exchange for videotrons station telemetropole holdings that deal quickly hit a snag when a third cable company cogeco inc launched a takeover bid for all of cfcf forcing videotron to make its own takeover offer in june  videotron won the takeover battle and acquired cfcf for c million in cash the takeover agreement also provided for videotron to assume cfcfs debt of more than  million the addition of cfcfs holdings boosted videotron to its position as the number two cable operator in canada while giving it a lock on cable and broadcast services to the countrys frenchspeaking population included in the deal was cfcfs quatre saisons television network which videotron sold off in april  to satisfy canadas television regulating body meanwhile the unforeseen purchase put a strain on the companys finances in order to absorb the cfcf acquisition videotron decided to exit the uk cable market after spending some  million building its uk infrastructure while achieving only a  percent penetration the company sold its  percent stake in videotron holdings to bell cablemedia for  million in october  videotron also began looking to sell off its us wireless cable holdings the ubi launch was finally readied for september  the success of interactive television remained to be seen particularly with the promised advent of increased internetbased video and data technologies but videotron had not neglected that market in april  the company joined with several leading canadian cable companies including rogers communications moffat communications cogeco cable inc access cable and regina cable to form visoncom with an eye on developing the nationwide standardized cable network providing internet telephony and interactive television services as the technology prepared to advance andré chagnons vision of interactive television seemed more than a possibilityand
