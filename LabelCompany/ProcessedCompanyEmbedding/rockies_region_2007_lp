production taxes   crude oil natural gas and ngls sales changes in crude oil natural gas and ngls sales volumes for  compared to  crude oil natural gas and ngls production on an energy equivalencybasis remained relatively consistent as decreases in production during the first half of  due to high line pressure hindering production from flowing into the gathering system was largely offset by increases in production in the second half of  mainly attributable to a reduction in system line pressures the installation of new compressor stations and resumed production from certain wells that were shutin in prior periods for wellbore integrity testing this partnership continued to experience high line pressures on the midstream system in the first half of  however the lucerne ii processing plant and additional new compressor stations on the gathering system began initial operations in june  resulting in immediate reductions in line pressures this partnership experienced further line pressure reductions in the fourth quarter of  particularly in december when this partnerships primary service provider dcp completed its grand parkway gas gathering project line pressures on the midstream system decreased from approximately  psi at june   to approximately  psi at december   as a result of the reduction in line pressures during the second half of  production from this partnerships vertical wells increased by  in the second half of  when compared to the first half further the managing general partner expects sustained relief of gathering system pressure on this partnerships primary gatherers system through  depending upon the impact of reduced drilling activity in the field going forward if there is sustained relief of the gathering system pressure as anticipated several currently shutin wells may come online resulting in improved production this partnership relies on its thirdparty midstream service provider to construct compression gathering and processing facilities to keep pace with production growth as a result the timing and availability of additional facilities going forward is beyond the managing general partners control falling commodity prices have resulted in reduced investment in midstream facilities by some third parties increasing the risk that sufficient midstream infrastructure may not be available in future periods for sustained relief of gathering system line pressures changes in crude oil sales the approximate  or  decrease in crude oil sales for  as compared to  was attributable to a decrease in the average selling price of  per bbl and a production volume decrease of  the average selling price per bbl was  for  compared to  for  changes in natural gas sales the approximate  or  decrease in natural gas

for  compared to  for  crude oil natural gas and ngls pricing this partnerships results of operations depend upon many factors particularly the price of crude oil natural gas and ngls and the managing general partners ability to market this partnerships production effectively crude oil natural gas and ngls prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices the price of crude oil decreased during the second half of  compared to the first half of  amid continuing concerns regarding high us inventories and slowing global demand for crude oil natural gas prices in  were at significantly lower levels than the comparable periods of  ngl prices declined significantly during  and while they have stabilized somewhat also remain at low levels relative to those experienced in  the managing general partner expects pricing to remain at depressed levels in  and perhaps beyond these declines in prices have had a material impact on this partnerships  financial results this partnerships crude oil natural gas and ngls sales are recorded under either the netback or gross method of accounting depending upon the related purchase agreement this partnership uses the netback method of accounting for natural gas and ngls as well as a portion of this partnerships crude oil production as the majority of the purchasers of these commodities also provide transportation gathering and processing services this partnership sells commodities at the wellhead and collects a price and recognizes revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price the netback method results in the recognition of a sales price that is below the indices for which the production is based this partnership uses the gross method of accounting for crude oil delivered through the white cliffs pipeline as the purchasers do not provide transportation gathering or processing services under this method this partnership recognizes revenues based on the gross selling price and recognizes transportation gathering and processing expenses as a component of production costs   crude oil natural gas and ngls production costs generally crude oil natural gas and ngls production costs vary with changes in total crude oil natural gas and ngls sales and production volumes production taxes are estimates by the managing general partner based on tax rates determined using published information these estimates are subject to revision based on actual amounts determined during future filings by the managing general partner with the taxing authorities production taxes vary directly with crude oil natural gas and ngls sales fixed monthly well operating costs increase on a per unit basis as production decreases in addition general oil field services and all other costs vary and can fluctuate based on services required but are expected to increase as wells age and require more extensive repair and maintenance these costs include water hauling and disposal equipment repairs and maintenance snow removal environmental compliance and remediation and service rig workovers changes in crude oil natural gas and ngls production expenses crude oil natural gas and ngls production costs for the year ended december   increased by approximately  compared to  primarily attributable to an increase in environmental and regulatory compliance expenses costs for additional contract labor oil transportation cost on the white cliffs pipeline well service rig costs and production equipment costs these increases were offset in part by a decrease in production taxes consistent with sales declines from  crude oil natural gas and ngls production costs per boe increased to  during  from  in  due to higher production costs direct costs  general and administrative direct costs  general and administrative for the year ended december   decreased approximately  compared to  primarily attributable to lower professional fees for audit services depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to  mainly attributable to a  decrease in the dda expense rate in  the dda expense rate per boe decreased to  for  compared to  during  primarily due to the effect of the impairments recorded on proved crude oil and natural gas properties in december  and september  impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties in  this partnership recognized impairment charges of approximately  million to writedown certain capitalized well costs on its proved crude oil and natural gas properties of which  million was recorded in the fourth quarter of  the impairment charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair value the estimated fair value of approximately  million excluding estimated salvage value of  million was determined based on estimated future discounted net cash flows a level  input using estimated production and future crude oil and natural gas prices which the managing general partner reasonably expects this partnerships crude oil and natural gas will be sold and decreased reserve quantities further deterioration of commodity prices could result in additional impairment charges to this partnerships crude

wells in this partnership  wells had a decrease in production totaling approximately  mboe or  in  compared to  and  wells had an increase in production totaling approximately  mboe or  in  compared to  three wells did not produce or produced minimal amounts of hydrocarbons in  and  the managing general partner is reviewing the partnerships wells that have the potential to increase production during this lower line pressure environment by incurring minimal expense the managing general partner expects that a portion of this partnerships wells may be uneconomical to operate and may be plugged and abandoned as a result as of december   this partnership has classified a portion of the asset retirement obligation as a current liability changes in accretion of asset retirement obligations aro expense aro expense increased  or  to  in  compared to  in  primarily attributable to an increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in december  to reflect increased estimated costs for materials and services related to the plugging and abandonment of certain wells as well as a decrease in the estimated useful life of these wells financial condition liquidity and capital resources historically this partnerships primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operating activities fluctuations in this partnerships operating cash flows are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and sales volumes this source of cash has primarily been used to fund this partnerships operating costs direct costsgeneral and administrative capital program and distributions to the investor partners and the managing general partner this partnerships future operations are expected to be conducted with available funds and revenues generated from crude oil natural gas and ngls production activities however crude oil natural gas and ngls production from existing properties are generally expected to continue a gradual decline in the rate of production over the remaining life of the wells therefore this partnership anticipates a lower annual level of crude oil natural gas and ngls production and therefore lower revenues unless commodity prices increase under these circumstances decreased production would have a material adverse impact on this partnerships operations and may result in the continued lack of cash distributions to the managing general partner and investor partners through  and beyond working capital at december   this partnership had working capital of  compared to working capital of  at december   the decrease of  was primarily due to the following changes • a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  • a decrease in accounts receivable of  • an increase in current asset retirement obligations of  and • an increase in amounts due to managing general partnerother net of  offset in part by • a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and • an increase in crude oil inventory of  the  decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to cash utilized to fund operating activities capital expenditures and cash distributions to partners although the do agreement permits this partnership to borrow funds on its behalf for partnership activities the managing general partner does not anticipate electing to fund any portion of this partnerships operations through borrowings partnership borrowings should any occur will be nonrecourse to the investor partners accordingly this partnership rather than the investor partners will be responsible for repaying any amounts borrowed   cash flows operating activities this partnerships cash flows from operating activities in  were primarily impacted by commodity prices production volumes operating costs and direct costsgeneral and administrative expenses the key components for the changes in this partnerships cash flows from operating activities are described in more detail in results of operations above net cash flows from operating activities were approximately  for the year ended december   compared to approximately  in  the decrease of approximately  in cash from operating activities was due primarily to the following • a decrease in crude oil natural gas and ngls sales of  • a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of  and • an increase in production costs of  offset in part by • a decrease in direct costsgeneral and administrative of  investing activities cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of investments in equipment from time to time this partnership invests in equipment which supports treatment delivery and measurement of crude oil natural gas and ngls or environmental protection during the year ended december   investments in equipment were approximately  compared to  in  financing activities this partnership initiated monthly cash distributions to investors in may  and has distributed  million through december   the table below presents cash distributions to this partnerships investors distributions to the managing general partner represent amounts distributed to the managing general partner for its  general partner interest in this partnership distributions to investor partners represent amounts distributed to investor partners for their  ownership share in this partnership and include amounts distributed to the managing general partner for limited partnership units repurchased cash distributions year ended december  managing general partner investor partners total            the decrease in distributions for the year ended december   as compared to  is primarily due to a decrease in cash flows from operations during  resulting from the decrease in the average sales price per boe offbalance sheet arrangements as of december   this partnership had no existing offbalance sheet arrangements as defined under sec rules which have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on this partnerships financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources commitments and contingencies see note  commitments and contingencies to the accompanying financial statements included elsewhere in this report   recent accounting standards see note  summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements included elsewhere in this report critical accounting policies the managing general partner has identified the following policies as critical to business operations and the understanding of the results of operations of this partnership the following is not a comprehensive list of all of this partnerships accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for managements judgment in their application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting available alternatives would not produce a materially different result however certain of this partnerships accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of this partnerships financial position and results of operations and the managing general partner may use significant judgment in their application as a result these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying these policies the managing general partner uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on historical experience observation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report crude oil natural gas and ngls properties this partnership accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting costs of proved developed producing properties and development dry hole costs are capitalized and depreciated or depleted by the unitofproduction method based on estimated proved developed producing reserves property acquisition costs are depreciated or depleted on the unitofproduction method based on estimated proved reserves annually the managing general partner engages independent petroleum engineers to prepare reserve and economic evaluations of this partnerships properties on a wellbywell basis as of december  proved developed reserves are those crude oil natural gas and ngls quantities expected to be recovered from currently producing zones under the continuation of present operating methods this partnerships reserves are adjusted for divestitures during the year as needed the process of estimating and evaluating crude oil natural gas and ngls reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result revisions in existing reserve estimates occur although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the managing general partners most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates over time because estimates of reserves significantly affect this partnerships dda expense a change in this partnerships estimated reserves could have an effect on its net income this partnership assesses its crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment upon a triggering event by comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows on a fieldbyfield basis using estimated production based upon prices at which the managing general
