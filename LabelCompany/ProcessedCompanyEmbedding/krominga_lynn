reading the main story from the green tiffany lamps on the entrance pillars to the wings curved like a warming embrace toward the gravel driveway the dutch door and the intricately patterned iron radiator covers the squarefoot house oozed character and charmits a big house but on the other hand you dont get the impression its big mr shiboleth said wandering through the sprawling abode showing off cozy nooks wainscoting pocket doors and three stairwells its very intimatehe too was lovestruck mr shiboleth shelled out more than  million for the   acre estate in the winter of  and picked up an adjoining   acre plot the following year for an additional  millionmeadowcroft originally stood on  waterfront acres with more than  acres across montauk highway meadowcroft was built for theodore e

the conklins in lower manhattanjust in time for the homes th birthday ms krominga and mr shiboleth are completing its  million restoration including replacing an asphalt roof with terra cotta tiles that resemble the original and putting two sets of tiffany sconces found in the basement back on the wallsto celebrate they commissioned michael mckenzie a manhattanbased author to research and write

in the basement along with a movie theater in the attic the caretakers quarters have been moved and the original toolhouse renovated as a guest cottage but the blanket of fuschiatoned rhododendrons
