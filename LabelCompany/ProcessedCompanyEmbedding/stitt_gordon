india topics  ethernetip gordon stitt interviewlight readingcomment login tweet the light reading interview in the spotlight gordon stitt president ceo and chairman extreme networks in the often staid world of networking any company that embraces bathroom humor encases its products in deep purple plastic and keeps a bottle of tequila in its conference room might be labeled a bit extreme of course when the company calls itself extreme networks inc nasdaq extr all the above fits right in at the helm of this operation is longtime networking veteran gordon stitt who in a previous life was a founder of network peripherals a pioneer in the field of network switching five years ago stitt along with stephen haddock and herb schneider also network peripherals veterans started extreme betting that ethernet switches could do the work of routers more quickly and at a lower cost so far the companys plan has been a success as extreme claims to have sold product to support  million ethernet ports making it a leader in the layer  switch market but as extreme looks to expand into new markets  especially those outside its largeenterprise comfort zone  stitt might be wise to keep the salt and limes nearby competitively extreme faces challenges from above and below its main foe is cisco systems inc nasdaq csco which extreme says it sees headtohead in  percent of its potential deals  something like playing the yankees four days out of five extreme with just  or so employees knows it cant be cisco so it must find other ways to compete with the giant on the startup side extreme has competition from foundry networks inc nasdaq fdry and riverstone networks nasdaq rstn though it faces them with confidence extremes swagger is reinforced by internal marketing messages in the companys mens room – where plastic urinal screens have the words foundry networks printed on them and a poster above the urinal proclaims riverstone networks – youre soaking in it the poster also contains some productcomparison stats as well as a warning dont fall in extremes corporate sense of humor could come in handy in the near future as the company tries to push into toughersell markets like the metro serviceprovider arena while weathering the publicmarket meltdown fiscally extreme will stick to its guns in not offering vendor financing instead looking for deeppocketed customers who are fully funded internally extreme shows restraint by eschewing fancy espresso machines in favor of a popcorn wagon in its kitchen – more in line with what one employee calls the cold pizza and diet coke culture of a company named after its founders love for extreme skiing the yearold stitt who isnt afraid to wear a deep purple logoed buttondown shirt to an interview says hes still excited by the promise of highspeed networking a rush that makes his job more fun than anything else he could imagine read on as gordon stitt explains his extreme thinking on acquisitions and wall street strategic

person connected to sir thomas jackson through links of family and geography in the notes beneath  which are rather disjointed at present  i have included all the bits that have led me to make the connection with the jackson family it also helped that sir thomas jacksons mother repeatedly suggested that her son hire gordon stitt and also mentioned his grandfather gordon holmes who was the subinspector of police for crossmaglen also elie ryder of bangor co down was a great help as she remembered uncle gordie and also recalled that he was cared for by an aunt after his mother died he was known to be generous to the speir aka speer family of cullyhanna  this would be his youngest sisters family when he died four gold cups were were part of what was sent to cullyhanna from his estate parents  siblings of gordon holmes stitt   this is as far as i can get right now the records of the first three children are from creggan church records the dates for gordon  anna from other sources and the last children are from vital statistics this break in the records needs more attention before i can be certain that i have it all correctly recorded    william stitt      margaret holmes d mar

the first album of photos at gilford castle it has been generously shared with me by christine wright of gilford castle the inscription on the back of the photo reads mrs stitt of derryalone although the latter word borders on illegibility there is a townland named derryfalone and given the looseygoosey approach to spelling a trait that i share to my personal regret i shall presume that “derryfalone” and “derryalone” are one and the same other clues to go on there is also a physical resemblance to susan donaldson see corr family photos as well as donaldson family photos but also to mary dickie see dickie family photos and so on the intermarriages in the region  along with what appears to be a dominant gene  bequeathed a long face and strong chin to many extended family members also check out many of the jackson group this being the case using mere resemblance as a clue is pretty far fetched initially i thoought that this photo was of the mother of gordon stitt but now i am

mary mcbride waddle stitt john  jul  creggan armagh one more hsbc connection to freeduff is that margaret louise jackson the widow of hsbc manager david jackson d  yokohama lived at freeduff after her second marriage and died there in  after years of high living with a second husband she had run through her financial resources so the story goes and had to be supported by her brother james francis wright one last fish to net  which is likely to be a cousin  is the birth of a male child  last name of stitt in crossmaglen father mother child date details stitt john mcclean anna stitt unnamed male  oct  crossmaglen armagh gordon h stitt and his career with hsbc here we are firmer factual ground  sources archival records as well as frank hh king the history of the hongkong and shanghia banking corporation stitt first went east in  and i am guessing that he likely started in hong kong since he was a junior there a year later when he signed a thankyou letter to sir thomas jackson along with other appreciative juniors  he served in hong kong for three years and was then assigned to hiogo but apparently from  to  he actually served at penang and singapore in july of  he received a staff evaluation from gt how at kobe which described him as follows a good worker and very steady his conduct in and out of office is all i can desire – takes a great interest in his work and is a great favourite in july of  when he was in penang he continued to receive similar reviews for his work there from  then there is a gap in the record and he is reviewed again in penang in  with similar praise in  his staff performance review again stellar indicates that he has been serving as the accountant at penang from there he went to japan where he served as submanager at yokohama then the main branch in japan after this he served for seven years during wwi as manager in kobe from  in  he was appointed acting manager in shanghai during the leave of the current manager stephen when stephen became chief manager stitt was appointed manager shanghai until his resignation in  with   years eastern service he then received a gratuity of ₤ and a pension of ₤ per annum until he died in may  aged ” the two lions which were installed in front of the new hsbc building in shanghai were named after stitt and stephen the lion named stitt  likely named by the local chinese in appreciation for stitts success with the hsbc in shanghai according to james caldwell who worked in shanghai in  gordon stitt was  a very jovial character who had been put there you might say as a public relations officer he was very popular and many stories have been told about him and one in particular when he was agent in kobe before he went to shanghai in the first war being typically irish there was an auction to get money for some of the war relief funds and he took off his irish tweed trousers and had them sold at the auction i think they went for £ and he walked back to the bank along the street in kobe just in his underpants i was there with him at a pointtopoint meeting  he was a very keen rider and the ponies there were these mongolian ponies which were very strong and sturdy but short and this lady came up to him dressed in his tweeds and said i think you should be ashamed of yourself with a stomach like yours mr stitt going to ride a little pony like that he said oh the pony will carry me all right dont worry about that but if you think im doing anything about this stomach of mine you have got another think coming ive had so much fun getting it       site map  legal disclaimer

are you maybe looking for firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
