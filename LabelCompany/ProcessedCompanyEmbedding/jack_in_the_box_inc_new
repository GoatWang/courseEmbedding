qsr magazine jump to navigation jack in the box planting seeds for franchise growth one of the nation’s largest restaurant companies is pursuing an innovative growth strategy to expand into new markets jack in the box inc which operates or franchises more than  jack in the box restaurants in the us is developing its namesake locations in select new markets and simultaneously offering those restaurants for sale to franchisees along with development rights for the entire market this strategy to seed new markets with company locations benefits both jack in the box which is seeking to expand its underpenetrated brand beyond its current footprint and franchise operators looking for a costeffective way to enter a market “we’re able to leverage our brand strengths and resources to secure prime locations and then open those restaurants with the full support of our experienced operations and marketing teams” says grant kreutzer director of franchise licensing and recruitment for jack in the box “rather than speculate on customer traffic that an undeveloped site could generate prospective franchisees and their financing partners can review actual sales trends and cash flows from multiple locations it’s really an effective growth strategy for jack in the box and our franchisees” jack in the box is currently seeding restaurants in oklahoma city tulsa kansas city indianapolis and cincinnati and is searching for multiunit restaurant groups in those areas looking for a growth opportunity in the quickserve category of the restaurant industry qualified candidates usually operate other noncompeting quickserve brands or casualdining concepts but kreutzer says operations and restaurant development professionals are forming new franchising groups by partnering with investors looking to get into the quickserve industry “we’re seeing a trend among restaurant industry professionals who form new franchise groups by partnering with individual investors” he says “in our seed markets they can use their acquisition of existing restaurants along with their local knowledge and development expertise as a platform for continued growth” to encourage expansion in new markets jack in the box is currently offering an incentive program in which it will reduce royalties by up to  percent for five years and waive the  franchise fee it typically charges for each new restaurant opened and in select new markets franchisees have up to  percent of their advertising fee allocated into local marketing efforts an innovative seed strategy and a new incentive program help franchisees expand with jack in the box into new markets these incentives are also available to franchisees developing restaurants in nonseed new markets as they have recently done in albuquerque colorado springs and lubbock other new nonseed markets approved for franchise development include amarillo little rock louisville salt lake city and champaign illinois jack in the box experienced substantial growth in recent years increasing its unit count by nearly  percent since  still the brand has a relatively small franchise community with  franchisees operating about  restaurants “our size gives us a strategic advantage over larger more complex franchise systems” kreutzer says “we can react to changing market conditions expedite menu enhancements and deploy new processes and procedures more quickly than a lot of our competitors” this agility enabled jack in the box to develop one of the industry’s most varied and innovative menus founded in  and a pioneer of the concept of drivethru dining jack in the box offers a variety of hamburgers chicken sandwiches and real ice cream shakes as well as nontraditional quickserve items such as entrée salads chicken fajita pitas teriyaki chicken bowls egg rolls and jalapeño poppers “when it comes to our menu jack in the box has something for just about everyone” kreutzer says the same could be said about investment

locations at once easy job by neal ungerleider minute readwhen you walk into jack in the box’s corporate headquarters two anonymous midrise buildings in a san diego office park the first thing you see is the branding jack the fast food chain’s mascot and imaginary ceo is everywhere jack has a parking spot outside the building jack appears on the wall decorations jack appears on signs for every room and office jack randomly pops up in the hallways jack owns the placeadvertisementand jack’s chain is at a crossroads as fast food restaurants go jack in the box has a solid market niche they’ve got a lock on junkfoodloving millennials thanks to items like their buttery jacks cheeseburgers with a hefty topping of herb butter and late night “munchie meals” which include items like a hamburger with a grilled cheese sandwich for buns and a chickenandnacho chips sandwich and the chain’s restaurants are a regular sight in the cities suburbs and small towns of the west coast but jack in the box–whose corporate parent also owns mexican chain qdoba–lacks a signature item as hard as they’ve tried they’ve never created a big mac a whopper or a newfangled breakout hit like doritos nachos supreme tacosso they did the natural thing create a massive oversized burger and overhaul its core menu components double jack burger the quest to create a new burgerat the end of january jack in the box is rolling out a new burger called the “double jack” the sandwich consists of two quarterpound patties american cheese lettuce tomatoes ketchup mustard pickles and onions on a buttertoasted bun the burger whose name has already been trademarked by the brand made its formal debut in a super bowl ad and is designed to highlight a long laundry list of changes jack is making to their core product the super bowl advertisement also revealed a much larger publicity stunt designed to promote the menu changes a giveaway of one million free hamburgers from the fast food chain upon visiting jack in the box’s website customers can sign up to have a coupon for a free double jack or jumbo jack burger sent to them by email or text message the double jack is at the center of a larger campaign called the “declaration of delicious” anchored around the super bowl ad the declaration of delicious which features of course and god bless them a colonialattired jack named “jack washington” is designed to introduce the public to much larger changes jack in the box is making to its menuthat new buttered bun inspired by the breakout popularity of the buttery jack is making its way to jack’s other burgers and chicken sandwiches the burgers are switching from heavily seasoned patties that are a miracle of modern food science to unseasoned  beef patties with the exception of the buttery jack which will have what the brand calls a “signature patty” whose non beef nature is noted in advertising asterisks as seen below the tomatoes and lettuce the chain uses are being tweaked jack in the box’s marketing team tells me they’re even making the switch to real mayonnaisei asked iwona alter jitb’s vp of product marketing and innovation what jack used before if they are only now switching to “real mayonnaise” alter told me that it was “an onionmayonnaise sauce before that was part of our signature taste” real mayo she added works better with the chain’s menu changesadvertisementa few minutes later i bit into a double jack created by the hardworking team in the chain’s spotless test kitchen it was delicious in a platonic ideal of fast food kind of way and tasted exactly like something i’d happily guiltily eat on a long road trip but changes to core menu items don’t happen in a bubble breakfast and burgersin  the biggest fast food industry development was mcdonald’s launch of its allday breakfast when the global fast food giant decided to offer breakfast at all hours in the united states it spiked demand for eggs from suppliers and coincided with a sharp rise in egg prices due to government regulation in major states such as california that required larger cages for egglaying chickens mcdonalds’ decision to offer allday breakfast was also a challenge for jack in the box which has offered an allday breakfast since the sin an earnings call earlier this december jack in the box’s real life ceo leonard comma told investors that his chain was focusing on hamburgers in response to mcdonald’s breakfast expansion the chain however doesn’t have a flagship burger the double jack joins at press time two different buttery jacks a spicy sriracha burger the sourdough jack two different ultimate cheeseburgers the jumbo jack the big cheeseburger and two smaller junior burgers there’s no clear flagship burger but the chain is doubling down on the idea that a burger should exist for every conceivable taste and price pointhowever the kind of menu items they can offer are limited due to their loyal customer base keith guilbault the chain’s tireless cmo told me that nearly  of the chain’s customers are drivethru customers and the customer base skews heavily toward millennials the drivethru issue especially determines the kinds of menu items that jack in the box sells mcdonald’s burger king and wendy’s all have much higher dinein rates than jack in the box whatever new menu items the chain rolls out have to be friendly to incar eatingit also means catering to the customer’s whim as guilbault explained the company’s stance is that “if you want a burger at  am we’ll get you a burger” it’s all about brand identitywhen i visited jack in the box’s offices it was during a quiet period when the chain explicitly declined to discuss its financials but it’s clear that the chain is in a state of transition this past september jack in the box switched ad agencies secret weapon marketing who largely created the jack box character and helped craft the chain’s response to a disastrous  e coli outbreak was dropped in favor of a new agency called davidgoliath for a chain like jack in the box which is tied to their mascot’s humorous commercials as deeply as mcdonald’s is tied to ronald mcdonald this was a massive change jack box carried on as ceo but no longer speaks in commercials–dick sittig jack’s longtime voice is secret weapon’s founderadvertisementaccording to a jack in the box representative “jack’s quiet at the moment but that’s a product of the role he’s been playing and the recent journey he’s been on in terms of where we go jack in the box owns all rights to jack’s character including his voice all aspects of his character are part of our consideration set for future marketing efforts”although the company’s financials have been largely positive with healthy earnings and revenue that increased  last quarter as compared to the same period last year jack in the box’s stock was downgraded by analysts at thestreet and vetr in recent months the san diego office complex i visited also holds some of qdoba’s offices according to guilbault the two chains share offices related to accounting and support operationsfor jack in the box the e coli outbreak was a defining moment that nearly put the chain out of business it resulted in four deaths and over  injuries including brain and kidney damage the fda adopted stringent new rules for the fast food industry as a result and jack in the box–to its credit–completely overhauled its safety and food testing standards and rolled out a set of best practices which serve as a role model to other fast food chains food safety continues to vex the fast food industry as i write this chipotle is dealing with a major food safety scandal of its ownthe very last area i was shown on my onsite visit was jack in the box’s inhouse product safety lab and guilbault and public relations staff were very careful that it made it onto my tour even  years later the food safety issue clearly remains on jack’s mindhowever the millennials who make up the core of jack’s audience don’t define the brand by their s scandal just as tylenol buyers today don’t associate its brand with the s dark days of tampered bottles and poisonings instead the big brand definition challenge for jack in the box is satisfying those late teen and twentysomething buyers who can’t get enough of sriracha chicken and  am tacos enter the butter toasterduring my meal at the jack in the box innovation kitchen–a double jack with curly fries and a milkshake–i was also shown some of the equipment sent out to the chain’s franchises for the menu overhaul jeff zwally the chain’s vice president of culinary development demoed one example for me a “butter wheel” for their new buns which automatically bastes the buns with butter as they toastadvertisementaccording to a jack in the box publicist the butter wheel “allows for easy application and an even buttery spread on every bun before they go into the toaster“the new toaster has to be shipped out to over  locations in  states zwally says the toasters are shipped out by region because the menu changes also require changes to workflow managers and restaurant staff need to be trained too swift serving time has been an ongoing obsession of the chain according to recent earnings calls and this means making the change as invisible to customers as possibletimed to coincide with the super bowl the campaign is rolling out inside stores on thursday january  with the double jack making it onto menus and other changes being made to  items served at the chain by the time the super bowl kicks off jack’s individual restaurants will presumably be ready for the blitzfor all the gimmickry of the declaration of delicious campaign which i expect and admire it wouldn’t be a jack in the box campaign without funny television commercials after all it does mean core changes to their menu switching over the formula for their hamburger patties and having bakers supply different kinds of buns is a big hassle for any fast food chain underneath all the advertising and marketing blitzing jack in the box seems to be engaged in a different game–thriving in an insanely complex fast food sector where cutthroat competition is the norm the chain hopes the new burgers will be a hit with customers and we’ll find out soonupdate this article was updated to clarify that patties for the buttery jack are a different product than those in the brand’s other burgers this article was also updated to include a one million free hamburger giveaway the chain announced during the super bowladvertisementrelated storiestechnologyinside the ico bubble why initial
