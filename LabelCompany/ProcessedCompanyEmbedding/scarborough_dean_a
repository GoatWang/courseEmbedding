appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early

leadership  companies  executives  putting a new label on avery dennison putting a new label on avery dennison ceo dean scarborough is pushing an ambitious plan to transform the company from a materials supplier to a brand builder and provider of information services jul   steve minter email tweet comments  advertisement what is our role in the world that was the question dean scarborough began asking himself when he became ceo of avery dennison corp five years ago known best to consumers for its office products the companys two largest businesses are as a supplier of pressuresensitive materials and a provider of retail information products which includes fabric labels and radio frequency identification rfid tags the companys individual businesses had clear strategies and knew their customers well but employees had a difficult time connecting to what avery dennisons overall strategy was so he struggled with finding a unifying vision around which the companys employees could marshal their efforts thats not an insignificant issue in a company with  employees operating in  countries avery dennison no  on the iw us  had sales of  billion in  in developing this vision statement scarborough had the advantage of knowing the company intimately he joined avery dennison in  and rose steadily through the ranks becoming vice president and general manager of fasson roll north america in  and then moving to the netherlands in  to lead roll materials europe two years later he returned to the united states to assume group vice president duties and then became president and chief operating officer in  scarborough was first attracted to avery because of a culture that encouraged initiative and was supportive of new ideas but  years later when he assumed the reins of the company he was faced with an old nemesis of many ceos  a stock price in the doldrums he began taking a series of steps to fuel growth and improve operational efficiency he also set out to shift the companys focus so that it was more external out of that work and more than a year of thought scarborough finally landed on a compelling vision rather than focus on what the company was making he centered the message on how the company was adding value for customers  helping them sell their products through packaging solutions that enhance their brands and through technologies such as rfid tags that provide enhanced intelligence to manufacturers and retailers in a may  speech at the pathway to manufacturing prosperity conference sponsored by the italian trade commission and industryweek scarborough said avery dennison is transforming ourselves from a manufacturer of basic materials into something more  a trusted partner who makes every brand more inspiring and the world more intelligent that is our new vision external focus to achieve growth scarborough knew when he became ceo in  that he would have to shake up avery dennisons product mix i felt we did not have enough earnings growth in the existing portfolio he recalls office products was a declining business which had great cash flow but there was a way for us to create shareholder value by creating a new business model with retail information services that meant pursuing rfid technology and its promise for bringing a new dimension to product tracking and retail information the emergence of a chip that costs a dime and allows you to get intelligence on a product and track it in multiple locations is an incredibly powerful concept said scarborough about rfid it is going to enable a lot of industries to drive to a level of efficiency that they have never thought possible before this is not just itemlevel tracking for retail or getting baggage to move on airlines as an example he cites research the company is doing on tracking food spoilage without employing destructive testing there is all kinds of work going on now at a kind of micro level on how to track things much differently than before that is what we mean by making the world more intelligent in  the company completed its acquisition of paxar corp for  billion a move intended to bolster avery dennisons rfid technology offering provide a bigger footprint in emerging markets and enhance its market profile in europe scarborough sought to enhance avery dennisons understanding of the markets it serves by hiring managers who had experience in those industries we knew we needed to bring in marketing capabilities scarborough explains scarborough reasoned that these new managers could be taught about avery dennison quickly and then their fresh perspective and intimate knowledge of their assigned industries would help drive innovation a central part of scarboroughs plan to grow the company has been an intensified focus on its external customers thats the change i am really trying to drive by external i dont mean our direct customers the label printer is our direct customer we have got to get to the end users because that is where the real innovation can occur scarborough says the drive has been to get employees talking with customers understanding their needs and then bringing them solutions as an example of this new approach to the market scarborough cited the roll materials teams work with wine and spirits customers people who buy wine are purchasing more than a pleasant liquid  they are acquiring a lifestyle and the label is where that lifestyle can be expressed he said our segment marketers created an elegant wine label catalogue for vintners that positions wine as a luxury product and our labels as the symbol of that luxury in the case of mot et chandon avery dennison produced a cravate from pressuresensitive labelstock and adhesives that keeps the foil securely around the curved bottleneck but does so without any wrinkles recession moves avery dennisons plant in queretaro mexico saw dramatic service and financial improvements after implementing the companys enterprise lean sigma processbut even the best plans are subject to upset when the global economy takes a massive blow the recession hit us when consumers stopped shopping retailers destocked and slashed inventories and white collar businesses stopped buying office supplies scarborough told the italian trade commission audience and the bottom fell out of the housing automotive and advertising industries which are all significant markets for us as a result sales fell  million from  to  the company recorded a  million loss and cut its dividend in half of course all this came on the heels of the paxar acquisition my timing couldnt have been worse i bought at the top of the market right before the worst retail recession in years scarborough admits conceding that it has contributed to investor skepticism as the recession took hold avery dennison quickly moved to minimize the economic impact in late  it started a restructuring that will generate  million in ongoing fixed cost reductions the company also had its businesses concentrate on maximizing free cash flow notes scarborough they overdelivered  we grew free cash flow  million over  to a record  million as a result we were able to reduce debt protect our credit ratings and preserve our financial flexibility during this period avery dennison also was extending its enterprise lean sigma els process throughout its operations scarborough explained that els had its roots in the companys office products business where it had been instrumental in reducing direct labor costs  and the cost of goods sold by more than  million in the roll materials business els helped reduce inventory levels in  by  million a  improvement over the previous year and led to a  increase in inventory turns scarborough said the word enterprise in the program emphasized to employees the need to take a comprehensive view of the entire value stream to identify whats truly valuable and whats not he added that the key element of els was the fact that the customer defines value and not us the implication is that els is not a costreduction program its a valuecreation system  a tool for growth scarborough told the italian trade commission audience that els is providing avery dennison with three main benefits an improvement in the basic elements of service  reliability timeliness and flexibility for example averys plant in queretaro mexico that prints and manufactures labels deployed els and doubled the efficiency of its core production facilities while cutting order lead times in half that boosted service levels above  and convinced the plants largest customer to stay and increase business stimulating innovation by focusing on solving customers problems retail information systems india scarborough notes contributed to growth by creating a new heat transfer process that does multicolor work in less time and with less cost an improvement in productivity which increases gross margins and generates funds for growth investments while scarborough is convinced the company is making the right moves to ensure longterm growth he admits that the results have not yet produced the anticipated shareholder value in betting on innovation technology and a solutionsfocused customer approach to help the company grow scarborough puts that growth in context we are not trying to be a highgrowth company but i think we can grow at higher rates than we have in the past he says i didnt think we had the portfolio to be able to do that a few years ago i think we have that now print reprints favorite email tweet please log in or
