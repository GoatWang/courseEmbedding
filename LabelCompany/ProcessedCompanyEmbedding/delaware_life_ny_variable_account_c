work just as hard for you good news people are living longer than ever before so your retirement savings need to last longer than ever before also keep in mind that traditional sources of retirement income like social security are often inadequate so putting plans in place for now and later is essential and annuities can be a powerful tool with greater security an annuity can help make your savings last longer than they otherwise could annuities are a way to pay yourself forward typically when you purchase an annuity contract you make a payment in exchange for a future stream of income if you’re still saving for retirement know that the earlier you save the more retirement income you’ll likely have to enjoy in the future if you’re already retired and want to start receiving income immediately you could make a onetime payment to fund the annuity or you can have the flexibility to make payments over time which will be based on the amount you wish to receive in retirement  your income is up to you what when and how some annuities provide income right away others set you up to receive income in the future buying an annuity now lets you secure your income when you need it

guaranteed income annuity lets you convert your savings into a secure source of income that’s guaranteed to last the rest of your lifetime—so you can be sure you’ll never run out of money in retirement  a fixed annuity offers taxdeferred growth based on a guaranteed fixed interest rate while a variable annuity allows you to pursue greater growth potential by investing in the market some variable annuities offer certain guarantees for an extra fee to help ensure your investment is more protected from the market’s possible downside  what if you need to cancel most fixed and variable annuities have a provision that allows you to cancel or surrender your policy surrender charges do apply on many products typically between one and nine years but they generally decrease every year
